	These forward-looking statements involve various risks and uncertainties. Although we believe
	that our expectations expressed in these forward-looking statements are reasonable, our expectations may later be found to be incorrect. Our actual results could be materially different from our expectations. Other sections of this annual report
	include additional factors that could adversely impact our business and financial performance. Moreover, we operate in an evolving environment. New risk factors and uncertainties emerge from time to time and it is not possible for our management to
	predict all risk factors and uncertainties, nor can we assess the impact of all factors on our business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any
	forward-looking statements. You should read thoroughly this annual report and the documents that we refer to with the understanding that our actual future results may be materially different from, or worse than, what we expect. We qualify all of our
	forward-looking statements by these cautionary statements.

	This annual report contains certain data and information that we obtained from
	various government and private publications. Statistical data in these publications also include projections based on a number of assumptions. The online automotive advertising industry may not grow at the rate projected by market data, or at all.
	The failure of this market to grow at the projected rate may have a material adverse effect on our business and the market price of our ADSs. In addition, the rapidly changing nature of the online automotive advertising industry and the online
	automobile transaction industry results in significant uncertainties for any projections or estimates relating to the growth prospects or future condition of our market. Furthermore, if any one or more of the assumptions underlying the market data
	are later found to be incorrect, actual results may differ from the projections based on these assumptions. You should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements.

	Substantially all of our operations are conducted in China and substantially all of our revenues are denominated in RMB. This annual report
	contains translations of RMB amounts into U.S. dollars at specific rates solely for the convenience of the reader. Unless otherwise noted, all translations from RMB to U.S. dollars and from U.S. dollars to RMB in this annual report were made at a
	rate of RMB6.4778 to US$1.00, the noon buying rate in The City of New York for cable transfers of RMB as certified for customs purposes by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York on December&nbsp;31, 2015. We make no representation that any RMB or U.S.
	dollar amounts could have been, or could be, converted into U.S. dollars or RMB, as the case may be, at any particular rate, at the rates stated below, or at all. The PRC government imposes control over its foreign currency reserves in part through
	direct regulation of the conversion of RMB into foreign exchange and through restrictions on foreign trade. On February&nbsp;29, 2016, the noon buying rate was RMB6.5525 to US$1.00.

	We rely on China&#146;s automotive industry for substantially all
	of our revenues and future growth. We have greatly benefited from the growth of China&#146;s automotive industry during the past few years. However, China&#146;s automotive industry is still at an early stage of development and are subject to many
	uncertainties. We cannot predict how this industry will develop in the future. Further, the growth of China&#146;s automotive industry could be affected by many factors, including general economic conditions in China, the urbanization rate of
	China&#146;s population, the growth of disposable household income, the cost of new automobiles as well as tax and incentives related to automobile purchases. In addition, governmental policies may have a considerable impact on the growth of the
	automotive industry in China. For example, in an effort to alleviate traffic congestion and improve air quality, the Beijing municipal government issued a regulation in December 2010 to limit the number of new passenger vehicle plates issued in
	Beijing each year to 240,000 commencing in 2011, and the limitation was subsequently further reduced to 150,000 starting from 2014. There are similar policies that restrict the issuance of new passenger vehicle plates in several other cities,
	Shanghai, Guangzhou, Tianjin, Guiyang, Shijiazhuang, Hangzhou and Shenzhen. Other cities such as Chengdu, Chongqing and Wuhan may take measures to limit the number of purchases of automobiles. In September 2013, the PRC government released a plan
	for the prevention and remediation of air pollution, which requires large cities such as Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou to further restrict the ownership of motor vehicles. In October 2013, the Beijing municipal government issued an additional
	regulation to limit the total number of vehicles in Beijing to no more than six million by the end of 2017, compared to approximately 5.2&nbsp;million vehicles in operation by the end of 2013. In 2015, the PRC government released high automobile
	emission standards and new tax benefits for electric cars. Since late 2014, the PRC government has released a series of incentive policies for new energy-efficient vehicles. Beginning from late 2011, the National Development and Reform Commission,
	one of China&#146;s antitrust regulatory authorities, initiated a series of investigations into the pricing practices of foreign automobile companies in China in connection with allegations of the lack of fair competition. These investigations may
	lead to price reductions due to enhanced competition. Such regulatory developments, as well as other uncertainties, may adversely affect the growth prospects of China&#146;s automotive industry, and in turn reduce demand for automobiles. If
	automakers and automobile dealers were to reduce their marketing expenditures as a result, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.

	cost-effective as our marketing activities in the past and may lead to significantly higher marketing expenses in the future. We conducted various sales and marketing initiatives to promote our brands through search engines, mobile platforms and
	navigation sites, a 10-year anniversary campaign, &#147;Singles&#146; Day&#148; event and various offline promotional activities such as the &#147;Group Buy&#148; initiative. For example, we have entered into an arrangement with Baidu for a 12-month

	We started to develop our transaction business in 2014 and has expanded to include direct vehicle sales and
	commission-based services facilitating transactions through our transaction platform. In June 2014, we launched Autohome Mall, an online transaction platform that we believe will allow us to be a transaction facilitator as we develop our transaction
	business. The success of our transaction business depends, in part, on third parties and factors over which we have limited control. We may incur more investment on inventory. We will need to react quickly to meet the changing consumer preferences
	and buying trends relating to our transaction business. We will also face competition from other websites engaged in the online automobile transaction business as well as from traditional dealerships. In addition, we also rely on our dealership
	partners to perform order fulfillments for vehicles sold on our platform. We may not be able to cooperate with dealership partners on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. We may not have full control over the order fulfillment procedures, and

	Furthermore, we must keep up to date with competitive technology
	trends, including the use of new or improved technology, creative user interfaces and other transaction marketing tools, such as paid search and mobile applications among others, which may increase our costs and which may not succeed in increasing
	sales or attracting consumers. Developing the transaction business may require significant investment in product development, sales and marketing and working capital, and we may not be able to get the expected return on our investment. As online
	automobile transaction is a relatively new business model, we cannot guarantee that the automobile consumers in China will accept such business model. Due to the limited operating history of our transaction business, we cannot predict that whether
	the consumers will trust our platform or view us as an option for purchasing automobile. Finally, developing the transaction business may take up our management&#146;s time and allow them less time to focus on our existing core business. Our
	transaction business is substantially dependent on the new vehicle sales level in China, which is sensitive to changing economic conditions. Our failure to successfully mitigate these risks and uncertainties might adversely affect the sales or
	margins in our transaction business, as well as damage our reputation and brand.

	business, we expect to include more vehicles in our inventory, which will make it more challenging for us to manage our inventory effectively and will put more pressure on our inventory system. If we fail to manage our inventory effectively, we may
	be subject to a heightened risk of inventory obsolescence, a decline in inventory values, and significant inventory write-downs or write-offs. We may misjudge customer demand and result in unexpected inventory build-up or possible inventory
	write-downs. In addition, we may be required to lower sale prices in order to reduce inventory level, which may lead to lower or even negative gross margins. High inventory levels may also require us to commit substantial capital resources,

	to protect our intellectual property. From time to time, other websites may use our articles, photos or other content without our proper authorization. Although such use has not in the past caused any material damage to our business, it is possible
	that there may be misappropriation on a much larger scale with a material adverse impact to our business. If we are unable to adequately protect our intellectual property rights in the future, our brand and business may suffer.

	The global

	challenges will be contained and what effects they each may have. There is considerable uncertainty over the long-term effects of the expansionary monetary and fiscal policies that have been adopted by the central banks and financial authorities of
	some of the world&#146;s leading economies, including China&#146;s. Economic conditions in China are sensitive to global economic conditions. Recently there have been signs that the rate of China&#146;s economic growth is declining. Any prolonged

	The Ministry of Commerce published a discussion draft of the proposed Foreign Investment Law in January 2015 aiming to, upon its enactment,
	replace the trio of existing laws regulating foreign investment in China, namely, the Sino-foreign Equity Joint Venture Enterprise Law, the Sino-foreign Cooperative Joint Venture Enterprise Law and the Wholly Foreign-invested Enterprise Law,
	together with their implementation rules and ancillary regulations. The draft Foreign Investment Law embodies an expected PRC regulatory trend to rationalize its foreign investment regulatory regime in line with prevailing international practice and
	the legislative efforts to unify the corporate legal requirements for both foreign and domestic investments. The Ministry of Commerce solicited comments on this draft in 2015, but no new draft has been published since then. As such, substantial
	uncertainties exist with respect to its enactment timetable, final content, interpretation and implementation. The draft Foreign Investment Law, if enacted as proposed, may materially impact the viability of our current corporate structure,
	corporate governance and business operations in many aspects.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Among other things, the draft Foreign Investment Law expands the definition
	of foreign investment and introduces the principle of &#147;actual control&#148; in determining whether a company is considered a foreign-invested enterprise, or an FIE. The draft Foreign Investment Law specifically provides that entities
	established in China but &#147;controlled&#148; by foreign investors will be treated as FIEs, whereas an entity set up in a foreign jurisdiction would nonetheless be, upon market entry clearance by the Ministry of Commerce, treated as a PRC domestic
	investor provided that the entity is &#147;controlled&#148; by PRC entities and/or citizens. In this connection, &#147;control&#148; is broadly defined in the draft law to cover the following summarized categories: (i)&nbsp;holding 50% of more of
	the voting rights of the subject entity; (ii)&nbsp;holding less than 50% of the voting rights of the subject entity but having the power to secure at least 50% of the seats on the board or other equivalent decision making bodies, or having the
	voting power to exert material influence on the board, the shareholders&#146; meeting or other equivalent decision making bodies; or (iii)&nbsp;having the power to exert decisive influence, via contractual or trust arrangements, over the subject
	entity&#146;s operations, financial matters or other key aspects of business operations. Once an entity is determined to be an FIE, it will be subject to the foreign investment restrictions or prohibitions set forth in a &#147;negative list,&#148;
	to be separately issued by the State Council later.&nbsp;Unless the underlying business of the FIE falls within the negative list, which calls for market entry clearance by the Ministry of Commerce, prior approval from the government authorities as
	mandated by the existing foreign investment legal regime would no longer be required for establishment of the FIE.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The VIE structure has
	been adopted by many PRC-based companies, including us, to obtain necessary licenses and permits in the industries that are currently subject to foreign investment restrictions in China. See &#147;Item 7. Major Shareholders and Related Party
	Transactions&#151;B. Related Party Transactions&#151; Contractual Agreements with our Variable Interest Entities&#148; and &#147;&#151;If the PRC government finds that the agreements that establish the structure for operating our services in China
	do not comply with PRC governmental restrictions on foreign investment in internet businesses, or if these regulations or the interpretation of existing regulations change in the future, we could be subject to severe penalties or be forced to
	relinquish our interests in those operations&#148; below. Under the draft Foreign Investment Law, VIEs that are controlled via contractual arrangement would also be deemed as FIEs, if they are ultimately &#147;controlled&#148; by foreign investors.
	Therefore, for any companies with a VIE structure in an industry category that is on the &#147;negative list,&#148; the VIE structure may be deemed legitimate only if the ultimate controlling person(s) is/are of PRC nationality (either PRC companies
	or PRC citizens). Conversely, if the actual controlling person(s) is/are of foreign nationalities, the VIEs will be treated as FIEs and any operation in the industry category on the &#147;negative list&#148; without market entry clearance may be
	considered as illegal.

	The draft Foreign Investment Law has not taken a position on what actions will be taken with
	respect to existing companies with a VIE structure, whether or not these companies are controlled by Chinese parties, while it is soliciting comments from the public on this point. The provision of internet content services, which we conduct through
	our VIEs, is subject to foreign investment restrictions set forth in the Catalogue for the Guidance of Foreign Investment Industries, or the Catalogue, issued by the National Development and Reform Commission and the Ministry of Commerce in March
	2015. It is unclear whether the new &#147;negative list&#148; will be different from the Catalogue. If the enacted version of the Foreign Investment Law and the final &#147;negative list&#148; mandate further actions, such as Ministry of Commerce
	market entry clearance or certain restructuring of our corporate structure and operations, to be completed by companies with existing VIE structure like us, we face substantial uncertainties as to whether these actions can be timely completed, or at

	The draft Foreign Investment Law, if enacted as
	proposed, may also materially impact our corporate governance practice and increase our compliance costs. For instance, the draft Foreign Investment Law imposes stringent ad hoc and periodic information reporting requirements on foreign investors
	and the applicable FIEs. Aside from the investment implementation report and investment amendment report that are required at each investment and alteration of investment specifics, an annual report is mandatory, and large foreign investors meeting
	certain criteria are required to report on a quarterly basis. Any company found to be non-compliant with these information reporting obligations may potentially be subject to fines and/or administrative or criminal liabilities, and the persons
	directly responsible may be subject to criminal liabilities.

	All of these contractual arrangements are governed by PRC law and provide for the resolution of disputes through arbitration in the PRC.

	States. As a result, uncertainties in the PRC legal system could limit our ability to enforce these contractual arrangements. Under PRC law, rulings by arbitrators are final, parties cannot appeal the arbitration results in courts, and the
	prevailing parties may only enforce the arbitration awards in PRC courts through arbitration award recognition proceedings, which would incur additional expenses and delay. In the event we are unable to enforce these contractual arrangements, we may

	the Payment and Settlement of Foreign Exchange Capital of Foreign-Invested Enterprises, or SAFE Circular&nbsp;19, which became effective on June&nbsp;1, 2015. Pursuant to SAFE Circular 19, foreign-invested enterprises may either continue to follow
	the current payment-based foreign currency settlement system or choose to follow the &#147;conversion-at-will&#148; system for foreign currency settlement. Where a foreign-invested enterprise follows the conversion-at-will system for foreign
	currency settlement, it may convert part or all of the amount of the foreign currency in its capital account into Renminbi at any time. The converted Renminbi will be kept in a designated account labeled as settled but pending payment, and if the
	foreign-invested enterprise needs to make payment from such designated account, it still needs to go through the review process with its bank and provide necessary supporting documents. SAFE Circular&nbsp;19, therefore, has substantially lifted the
	restrictions on the usage by a foreign-invested enterprise of its Renminbi registered capital converted from foreign currencies. According to SAFE Circular 19, such Renminbi capital may be used at the discretion of the foreign-invested enterprise
	and the SAFE will eliminate the prior approval requirement and only examine the authenticity of the declared usage afterwards. Nevertheless, foreign-invested enterprises like our PRC subsidiaries are still not allowed to extend intercompany loans to

	The Chinese economy differs from the economies of most developed countries in many respects, including the level of government involvement,
	level of development, growth rate, control of foreign exchange and allocation of resources. Although the Chinese government has implemented measures since the late 1970s emphasizing the utilization of market forces for economic reform, the reduction
	of state ownership of productive assets, and the establishment of improved corporate governance in business enterprises, a substantial portion of productive assets in China are still owned by the Chinese government. In addition, the Chinese
	government continues to play a significant role in regulating industry development by imposing industrial policies. The Chinese government also exercises significant control over China&#146;s economic growth through allocating resources, controlling
	payment of foreign currency-denominated obligations, setting monetary policy, and providing preferential treatment to particular industries or companies.

	While the Chinese economy has experienced significant growth over the past decades, the growth has been uneven, both geographically and among
	various sectors of the economy, and the rate of growth has been slowing. The Chinese government has implemented various measures to encourage economic growth and guide the allocation of resources. Some of these measures may benefit the overall
	Chinese economy, but may have a negative effect on us. For example, our financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected by government control over capital investments or changes in tax regulations. In addition, in the past
	the Chinese government has implemented certain measures, including interest rate increases, to control the pace of economic growth. These measures may cause decreased economic activity in China, which may adversely affect our business and operating

	We conduct our business primarily through our PRC subsidiaries and VIEs in China. Our operations in China are governed by PRC laws and
	regulations. Uncertainties in the interpretation and enforcement of PRC laws and regulations could limit the legal protections available to you and us. In 1979, the PRC government began to promulgate a comprehensive system of laws and regulations
	governing economic matters in general. The overall effect of legislation over the past several decades has significantly enhanced the protections afforded to various forms of foreign investments in China. However, China has not developed a fully
	integrated legal system, and recently enacted laws and regulations may not sufficiently cover all aspects of economic activities in China. In particular, because these laws and regulations are relatively new, and because of the limited volume of
	published decisions and their nonbinding nature, the interpretation and enforcement of these laws and regulations involve uncertainties. Since PRC administrative and court authorities have significant discretion in interpreting and implementing
	statutory and contractual terms, it may be difficult to evaluate the outcome of administrative and court proceedings and the level of legal protection we enjoy. Furthermore, the PRC legal system is based in part on government policies and internal
	rules, some of which are not published on a timely basis or at all, which may have a retroactive effect. As a result, we may not be aware of our violation of these policies and rules until sometime after the violation. In addition, any

	On July&nbsp;6, 2015, the Standing Committee of the National
	People&#146;s Congress of China released the Draft Cyber Security Law to solicit public comments. Once adopted, this will be the first Chinese law that focuses exclusively on cyber security. The Draft Cyber Security Law sets high requirements for
	the operational security of facilities deemed to be part of PRC&#146;s &#147;key information infrastructure facilities,&#148; and includes the integration of national security examinations under certain circumstances. Among which, &#147;key
	information infrastructure facilities&#148; includes networks and systems owned or managed by network service providers with a significant number of users. The Draft Cyber Security Law provides that key information infrastructure facilities
	operators must set up specialized internal security management divisions and assign appropriate person(s) responsible for security management. Additionally, these operators must conduct background checks on the person(s) responsible for security
	management and on personnel in critical positions. It further provides that when operators of key information infrastructure facilities purchase network products or services that may affect or involve national security, the operator must pass a
	security examination jointly arranged by the national network and information authority and the relevant government departments and the national security examination process under the National Security Law will be triggered. The operators of key
	information infrastructure facilities must store important data collected and generated, including citizens&#146; personal information, exclusively within the territory of the People&#146;s Republic of China. The Draft Cyber Security Law also sets
	increasingly more stringent requirements for network operators. The Draft Cyber Security Law establishes censorship duties for network operators, including digital information distribution service providers and application software download service
	providers. When these operators notice a prohibited publication, or the transmission of illicit information, they must promptly stop transmitting the information and take measures necessary to prevent the spread of that information. Operators must
	maintain a record of these incidents when they occur and report them to the competent authorities. The Draft Cyber Security Law provides relevant subjects with solid legal authorities who are empowered to take measures to cut off any transmission(s)
	of prohibited information on communication networks. Upon finding prohibited information, those authorities will require that the network operators stop the transmission and take the necessary measures to remove any prohibited content. Where the
	above prohibited information comes from outside the territory of China, these authorities may request that all related institutions to take necessary measures to stop the flow of prohibited information.

	Substantially all of our revenues and costs are denominated in RMB. The conversion of RMB into foreign currencies, including U.S. dollars, is
	based on rates set by the People&#146;s Bank of China. In July 2005, the PRC government changed its decades-old policy of pegging the value of the RMB to the U.S. dollar, and the RMB appreciated more than 20% against the U.S. dollar over the
	following three years. Between July 2008 and June 2010, this appreciation halted and the exchange rate between the RMB and the U.S. dollar remained within a narrow band. Since June 2010, the RMB has fluctuated against the U.S. dollar, at times
	significantly and unpredictably. It is difficult to predict how market forces or PRC or U.S. government policy may impact the exchange rate between the RMB and the U.S. dollar in the future.

	Among other things, certain regulations and rules concerning mergers and acquisitions established additional procedures and requirements that
	could make merger and acquisition activities by foreign investors more time-consuming and complex. For example, these regulations require that the Ministry of Commerce be notified in advance of any change-of-control transaction in which a foreign
	investor takes control of a PRC domestic enterprise or a foreign company with substantial PRC operations, if certain thresholds under the Provisions on Thresholds for Prior Notification of Concentrations of Undertakings, issued by the State Council
	on August&nbsp;3, 2008, are triggered. According to the Implementing Rules Concerning Security Review on Mergers and Acquisitions by Foreign Investors of Domestic Enterprises issued by the Ministry of Commerce in August 2011, mergers and
	acquisitions by foreign investors involved in an industry related to national security are subject to strict review by the Ministry of Commerce. These rules also prohibit any transactions attempting to bypass such security review, including by

	In
	December 2006, the People&#146;s Bank of China, or PBOC, promulgated the Administrative Measures of Foreign Exchange Matters for Individuals, which sets forth the respective requirements for foreign exchange transactions by individuals (both PRC and
	non-PRC citizens) under either the current account or the capital account. In January 2007, SAFE issued relevant implementing rules that specified approval requirements for certain capital account transactions such as a PRC citizen&#146;s
	participation in the employee stock incentive plans or share option plans of an overseas publicly listed company. In February 2012, SAFE promulgated the Notice on the Administration of Foreign Exchange Matters for Domestic Individuals Participating
	in the Stock Incentive Plans of Overseas Listed Companies, or the Stock Option Notice. The Stock Option Notice supersedes the requirements and procedures for the registration of PRC resident individuals&#146; participation in stock incentive plans
	set forth by certain rules promulgated by SAFE in March 2007. Under these measures, PRC resident individuals who participate in an employee stock incentive plan or a share option plan in an overseas publicly listed company are required to register
	with SAFE and complete certain other procedures. A PRC domestic qualified agent appointed through the PRC subsidiaries of such overseas listed company must file applications on behalf of such PRC resident individuals with SAFE or its local
	counterpart to obtain approval for an annual allowance with respect to the foreign exchange in connection with stock holding or share option exercises. With the approval from SAFE or its local counterpart, the PRC domestic qualified agent must open
	a special foreign exchange account at a PRC domestic bank to hold the funds required in connection with the stock purchase or option exercise, payment received upon sales of shares, dividends issued on the stock and any other income or expenditures
	approved by SAFE or its local counterpart. We and our PRC resident employees who participate in our share incentive plans are subject to these regulations as we are an overseas listed company. We have made registration with the local counterparts of
	SAFE for our PRC resident employees who participate in our share incentive plans as required under the Stock Option notice and relevant rules. If we or our PRC optionees fail to comply with these regulations, we or our PRC optionees may be subject

	Pursuant to the Notice on Strengthening Administration of Enterprise Income Tax for Share Transfers by Non-PRC Resident
	Enterprises, or SAT Circular 698, issued by the State Administration of Taxation, or the SAT, on December&nbsp;10, 2009 with retroactive effect from January&nbsp;1, 2008, where a non-resident enterprise transfers the equity interests of a PRC
	resident enterprise indirectly via disposing of the equity interests of an overseas holding company, or an Indirect Transfer, and such overseas holding company is located in a tax jurisdiction that: (a)&nbsp;has an effective tax rate less than 12.5%
	or (b)&nbsp;does not tax the foreign income of its residents, the non-resident enterprise, being the transferor, shall report to the relevant tax authority of the PRC resident enterprise this Indirect Transfer. Using a &#147;substance over
	form&#148; principle, the PRC tax authority may disregard the existence of the overseas holding company if it lacks a reasonable commercial purpose and was established for the purpose of reducing, avoiding or deferring PRC tax. As a result, gains
	derived from such Indirect Transfer may be subject to PRC withholding tax at a rate of up to 10%. SAT Circular 698 also provides that, where a non-PRC resident enterprise transfers its equity interests in a PRC resident enterprise to its related
	parties at a price lower than the fair market value, the relevant tax authority has the power to make a reasonable adjustment to the taxable income of the transaction.

	On February&nbsp;3, 2015, the SAT issued SAT Notice 7 to supersede the existing tax rules in relation to the Indirect Transfer, while the
	other provisions of SAT Circular 698 remain in force.&nbsp;SAT Notice 7 introduces a more sophisticated anti-avoidance guidance. SAT Notice 7 extends its tax jurisdiction to capture not only Indirect Transfer as set forth under SAT Circular 698 but
	also transactions involving transfer of movable and immovable property in China of a foreign company through the offshore transfer of a foreign intermediate holding company. According to SAT Notice 7, if a non-resident enterprise indirectly
	transfers PRC taxable properties through an arrangement without reasonable commercial purpose but to avoid PRC Corporate Income Tax, the Indirect Transfer shall be re-characterized and treated as a direct transfer of PRC taxable properties. SAT
	Notice 7 also interprets the term &#147;transfer of the equity interest in a foreign intermediate holding company&#148; broadly. In addition, SAT Notice 7 provides clearer criteria than Circular 698 on how to assess reasonable commercial purposes
	and introduces safe harbor scenarios applicable to the public trading of shares in a listed company holding taxable PRC assets and indirect transfers resulting from a corporate restructuring.

	Further, SAT Notice 7 replaces the compulsory reporting requirement in SAT Circular 698 with a
	voluntary reporting regime and the criteria set forth in Circular 698 for indirect transfer reporting have been abolished. Both the foreign transferor and the transferee, and the PRC tax resident enterprise whose equity interests being transferred
	may voluntarily report the transfer by submitting the documents required in SAT Notice 7. In addition to the voluntary reporting, SAT Notice 7 empowers the Chinese tax authorities to require various documents from the parties involved. Although SAT
	Notice 7 provides clarities in many important areas such as reasonable commercial purpose and reporting requirements, it brings challenges to both the foreign transferor and transferee of the Indirect Transfer as they are required to make a
	self-assessment on whether the transaction should be subject to PRC tax and to file or withhold the PRC tax accordingly. It also introduces the interest regime by providing that where a transferor fails to file and pay tax on time, and where a
	withholding agent fails to withhold the tax, interest will be charged on a daily basis. If the transferor has provided the required documents and information or has filed and paid the tax within 30 days from the date that the share transfer contract
	or agreement is signed, interest shall be calculated based on the benchmark interest rate; otherwise, the benchmark interest rate plus 5% will apply.

	Under the Enterprise Income Tax Law and its implementation rules, both of which became effective on January&nbsp;1, 2008, an
	enterprise established outside of the PRC with &#147;de facto management bodies&#148; within the PRC is considered a resident enterprise and will be subject to the enterprise income tax at the rate of 25% on its global income. The implementation
	rules define the term &#147;de facto management bodies&#148; as &#147;establishments that carry out substantial and overall management and control over the manufacturing and business operations, personnel, accounting, properties, etc. of an
	enterprise.&#148; The SAT issued the Notice Regarding the Determination of Chinese-Controlled Offshore Incorporated Enterprises as PRC Tax Resident Enterprises on the Basis of De Facto Management Bodies, or SAT Circular 82, on April&nbsp;22, 2009.
	SAT Circular 82 provides certain specific criteria for determining whether the &#147;de facto management body&#148; of a Chinese-controlled offshore-incorporated enterprise is located in China. Although SAT Circular 82 only applies to offshore
	enterprises controlled by PRC enterprises, not those controlled by PRC individuals, the determining criteria set forth in Circular 82 may reflect the SAT&#146;s general position on how the &#147;de facto management body&#148; test should be applied
	in determining the tax resident status of offshore enterprises, regardless of whether they are controlled by PRC enterprises or individuals. Although we do not believe that our legal entities organized outside of the PRC constitute PRC resident
	enterprises, it is possible that the PRC tax authorities could reach a different conclusion. In such case, we may be considered a PRC resident enterprise and may therefore be subject to enterprise income tax at a rate of 25% on our global income. If
	we are considered a PRC resident enterprise and earn income other than dividends from our PRC subsidiaries, a 25% enterprise income tax on our global income could significantly increase our tax burden and materially and adversely affect our cash

	In the event that the SEC restarts the administrative proceedings, depending upon the final
	outcome, listed companies in the United States with major PRC operations may find it difficult or impossible to retain auditors in respect of their operations in the PRC, which could result in financial statements being determined to not be in
	compliance with the requirements of the Exchange Act, including possible delisting. Moreover, any negative news about the proceedings against these audit firms may cause investor uncertainty regarding China-based, United States-listed companies and
	the market price of our ADSs may be adversely affected.

	If our independent registered public accounting firm was denied, even
	temporarily, the ability to practice before the SEC and we were unable to timely find another registered public accounting firm to audit and issue an opinion on our financial statements, our financial statements could be determined not to be in
	compliance with the requirements of the Exchange Act. Such a determination could ultimately lead to the delay or abandonment of this offering, delisting of our ordinary shares from the NYSE or deregistration from the SEC, or both, which would
	substantially reduce or effectively terminate the trading of our ADSs in the United States.

	Our corporate affairs are governed by our memorandum and articles of association, as amended and restated from time to time, and by the
	Companies Law and common law of the Cayman Islands. The rights of shareholders to take legal action against us and our directors, actions by minority shareholders and the fiduciary responsibilities of our directors are to a large extent governed by
	the common law of the Cayman Islands. The common law of the Cayman Islands is derived in part from comparatively limited judicial precedent in the Cayman Islands as well as from English common law, which provides persuasive, but not binding,
	authority. The rights of our shareholders and the fiduciary responsibilities of our directors under Cayman Islands law are not as clearly established as they would be under statutes or judicial precedents in the United States. In particular, the
	Cayman Islands has a less developed body of securities laws than the United States and provides significantly less protection to investors. In addition, Cayman Islands companies may not have standing to initiate a shareholder derivative action in

	could limit the ability of others to acquire control of our company, including a provision that grants authority to our board of directors to establish from time to time one or more series of preferred shares without action by our shareholders and
	to determine, with respect to any series of preferred shares, the terms and rights of that series. Preferred shares could be issued quickly with terms calculated to delay or prevent a change in control of our company or make removal of management
	more difficult. If our board of directors decides to issue preferred shares, the price of our ADSs may fall and the voting and other rights of the holders of our Class&nbsp;A ordinary shares and ADSs may be materially adversely affected. These

	Under United States federal income tax law, we will be classified as a passive foreign investment company (&#147;PFIC&#148;) for any taxable
	year if either (i)&nbsp;at least 75% of our gross income for the taxable year is passive income or (ii)&nbsp;at least 50% of the value of our assets (based on the average quarterly value of our assets during the taxable year) is attributable to
	assets that produce or are held for the production of passive income (the &#147;asset test&#148;). Although the law in this regard is not entirely clear, we treat our VIEs as being owned by us for United States federal income tax purposes because we
	control their management decisions and are entitled to substantially all of the economic benefits associated with such entities, and, as a result, we consolidate their results of operations in our consolidated U.S. GAAP financial statements.
	Assuming we are the owner of our VIEs for U.S. federal income tax purposes and based on our current income and assets, including goodwill and unbooked intangibles, we do not believe that we were a PFIC for the taxable year ended December&nbsp;31,
	2015 and do not anticipate becoming a PFIC in future taxable years.

	While we do not believe that we were a PFIC for the taxable year
	ended December&nbsp;31, 2015 and do not anticipate becoming a PFIC in the foreseeable future, no assurance can be given in this regard because the determination of whether we will be or become a PFIC is a fact-intensive inquiry made on an annual
	basis that depends, in part, on the composition of our income and assets. Fluctuations in the market price of our ADSs may cause us to become a PFIC for the current or subsequent taxable years because the value of assets for the purpose of the asset
	test may be determined by reference to the market price of our ADSs from time to time (which may be volatile). The composition of our income and assets may also be affected by how, and how quickly, we use our liquid assets. Under circumstances where
	our revenue from activities that produce passive income significantly increase relative to our revenue from activities that produce non-passive income, or where we determine not to deploy significant amounts of cash for active purposes, our risk of
	becoming classified as a PFIC may substantially increase. In addition, because there are uncertainties in the application of the relevant rules, it is possible that the Internal Revenue Service may challenge our classification of certain income and
	assets as non-passive or our valuation of our tangible and intangible assets, each of which may result in our becoming a PFIC for the current or subsequent taxable years.

	transactions through our transaction platform. We have completed new vehicle transactions on our platform through various sales initiatives and other promotional campaigns. In 2014 and 2015, we conducted several online marketing events on Autohome
	Mall and offline promotion campaigns with our partners for our transaction business. We also partnered with automakers to sell customized or exclusive models of selected vehicles on our platform.

	2013, 2014 and 2015, 75, 85 and 87 automakers in China, which includes independent Chinese automakers, joint ventures between Chinese and international automakers and international automakers that sell their cars made outside of China, purchased
	online advertisements from us. Our top five advertisers, all of whom were automakers, contributed 15.0%, 9.8% and 11.1% of our total net revenues in 2013, 2014 and 2015, respectively. No single automaker contributed more than 10% of our net revenues

	third-party advertising agencies. Depending on the type of advertiser and content, the duration of an advertising agreement ranges from one to twelve months, with the majority being one to three months. We typically require payment be made within 90
	days after the delivery of our services, but for contracts that last for three months or longer, installment payments are typically required. Our agreements with certain major advertising agencies contain a &#147;most-favored price term&#148;

	On March&nbsp;1, 2009, the MIIT promulgated the Administrative Measures on Telecommunications Business Operating License,
	or the Telecom License Measures, which took effect on April&nbsp;10, 2009. The Telecom License Measures set forth the types of licenses required to operate value-added telecommunications services and the qualifications and procedures for obtaining
	such licenses. For example, an ICP operator providing value-added services in multiple provinces is required to obtain an inter-regional license, whereas an ICP operator providing the same services in one province is required to obtain a local
	license.

	interest in a value-added telecommunication business in China, it must demonstrate a good track record and experience in operating value-added telecommunications services. Foreign investors that meet these requirements must obtain approvals from the

	On July&nbsp;13, 2006, the MIIT issued the Notice of the MIIT on Intensifying the Administration of Foreign Investment in Value-added
	Telecommunications Services. This notice prohibits domestic telecommunication service providers from leasing, transferring or selling telecommunications business operating licenses to any foreign investor in any form, or providing any resources,
	sites or facilities to any foreign investor for their illegal operation of a telecommunications business in China. According to this notice, either the holder of a value-added telecommunication business operating license or its shareholders must
	legally own the domain names and trademarks used by such license holders in their provision of value-added telecommunication services. The notice further requires each license holder to have the necessary facilities, including servers, for its
	approved business operations and to maintain such facilities in the regions covered by its license. In addition, all value-added telecommunication service providers are required to maintain network and internet security in accordance with the
	standards set forth in relevant PRC regulations. If a license holder fails to comply with the requirements in the notice and cure such non-compliance, the MIIT or its local counterparts have the discretion to take measures against such license
	holders, including revoking their valued-added telecommunication business operating licenses.

	In recent years, PRC government authorities have enacted legislation on internet use to protect personal
	information from any unauthorized disclosure. The PRC law does not prohibit ICP operators from collecting and using personal information from their users with the users&#146; consent. However, the Internet Measures prohibit an ICP operator from
	insulting or slandering a third party or infringing the lawful rights and interests of a third party. The regulations further authorize the relevant telecommunications authorities to order ICP operators to rectify unauthorized disclosure. ICP
	operators are subject to legal liability if the unauthorized disclosure results in damages or losses to users. The PRC government, however, has the power and authority to order ICP operators to turn over personal information if an internet user
	posts any prohibited content or engages in illegal activities on the internet. On December&nbsp;29, 2011, the MIIT promulgated the Several Provisions on Regulating the Market Order of Internet Information Services, effective as of March&nbsp;15,
	2012. It stipulates that ICP operators may not, without a user&#146;s consent, collect the user&#146;s information that can be used alone or in combination with other information to identify the user and may not provide any such information to third
	parties without the user&#146;s prior consent. ICP operators may only collect users&#146; personal information that is necessary to provide their services and must expressly inform the users of the method, content and purpose of the collection and
	use of such personal information. In addition, an ICP operator may only use users&#146; personal information for the stated purposes under the ICP operator&#146;s scope of service. ICP operators are also required to ensure the proper security of
	users&#146; personal information, and take immediate remedial measures if users&#146; personal information is suspected to have been inappropriately disclosed. If the consequences of any such disclosure are expected to be serious, ICP operators must
	immediately report the incident to the telecommunications regulatory authority and cooperate with the authorities in their investigations.

	treat diseases, animal and plant breeds, substances obtained by means of nuclear transformation or a design which has major marking effect on the patterns or colors of graphic print products or a combination of both patterns and colors. The Patent
	Office under the State Intellectual Property Office is responsible for receiving, examining and approving patent applications. A patent is valid for a term of twenty years in the case of an invention and a term of ten years in the case of utility
	models and designs. A third-party user must obtain consent or a proper license from the patent owner to use the patent. Otherwise, the use constitutes an infringement of patent rights. We had 92 pending patent applications and 19 registered patents

	On March&nbsp;30, 2015, SAFE issued
	the SAFE Circular&nbsp;19, which became effective on June&nbsp;1, 2015. Pursuant to SAFE Circular 19, foreign-invested enterprises may either continue to follow the current payment-based foreign currency settlement system or choose to follow the
	&#147;conversion-at-will&#148; system for foreign currency settlement. Where a foreign-invested enterprise follows the conversion-at-will system for foreign currency settlement, it may convert part or all of the amount of the foreign currency in its
	capital account into Renminbi at any time. The converted Renminbi will be kept in a designated account labeled as settled but pending payment, and if the foreign-invested enterprise needs to make payment from such designated account, it still needs
	to go through the review process with its bank and provide necessary supporting documents. SAFE Circular&nbsp;19, therefore, has substantially lifted the restrictions on the usage by a foreign-invested enterprise of its Renminbi registered capital
	converted from foreign currencies. According to SAFE Circular 19, such Renminbi capital may be used at the discretion of the foreign-invested enterprise and SAFE will eliminate the prior approval requirement and only examine the authenticity of the
	declared usage afterwards. Nevertheless, foreign-invested enterprises like our PRC subsidiaries are still not allowed to extend intercompany loans to our VIEs. In addition, as SAFE Circular 19 was promulgated recently, there remains substantial
	uncertainties with respect to the interpretation and implementation of this circular by relevant authorities. See &#147;Item 3. Key Information&#151;D. Risk Factors&#151;Risks Related to Our Corporate Structure&#151;PRC regulation of loans to, and
	direct investment in, PRC entities by offshore holding companies and governmental control of currency conversion may restrict or prevent us from using the proceeds of our equity offerings to make loans to our PRC subsidiaries and VIEs or to make
	additional capital contributions to our PRC subsidiaries, which may materially and adversely affect our liquidity and our ability to fund and expand our business.&#148;

	In December 2006, the PBOC promulgated the Administrative Measures of Foreign Exchange Matters for Individuals, setting forth the respective
	requirements for foreign exchange transactions by individuals (both PRC or non-PRC citizens) under either the current account or the capital account. In January 2007, SAFE issued relevant implementing rules that specified approval requirements for
	certain capital account transactions, such as a PRC citizen&#146;s participation in employee stock ownership plans or share option plans of an overseas publicly listed company. In February 2012, SAFE promulgated the Stock Option Notice that
	supersedes the requirements and procedures for the registration of PRC resident individuals&#146; participation in stock incentive plans set forth by certain rules promulgated by SAFE in March 2007. The purpose of the Stock Option Notice is to
	regulate the foreign exchange administration of PRC resident individuals who participate in employee stock holding plans and share option plans of overseas listed companies.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	According to the Stock Option Notice, if a PRC resident individual participates in any employee stock incentive plan of an overseas listed
	company, a PRC domestic qualified agent appointed through the PRC subsidiary of such overseas listed company must, among other things, file, on behalf of such individual, an application with SAFE or its local counterpart to obtain approval for an
	annual allowance with respect to the purchase of foreign exchange in connection with stock holding or share option exercises. With the approval from SAFE or its local counterpart, the PRC domestic qualified agent shall open a special foreign
	exchange account at a PRC domestic bank to hold the funds required in connection with the stock purchase or option exercise, any returned principal or profits upon sales of shares, any dividends issued on the stock and any other income or
	expenditures approved by SAFE or its local counterpart.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Under the Foreign Currency Administration Rules, as amended, the foreign exchange
	proceeds of domestic entities and individuals can be remitted into China or deposited abroad, subject to the terms and conditions to be issued by SAFE. However, the implementing rules in respect of depositing the foreign exchange proceeds abroad
	have not been issued by SAFE. The foreign exchange proceeds from the sales of shares can be converted into RMB or transferred to such individuals&#146; foreign exchange savings account after the proceeds have been remitted back to the special
	foreign exchange account opened at the PRC domestic bank. If share options are exercised in a cashless exercise, the PRC domestic individuals are required to remit the proceeds to special foreign exchange accounts.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Many issues with respect to the Stock Option Notice require further interpretation. We and our PRC employees who participate in an employee
	stock incentive plan are subject to the Stock Option Notice as we are an overseas listed company. We have registered with the local counterparts of SAFE for our PRC resident employees who participate in our share incentive plans, as required under
	the Stock Option Notice and relevant rules. If we or our PRC employees fail to comply with the Stock Option Notice, we and our PRC employees may face sanctions imposed by the PRC foreign exchange authority or any other PRC government authorities,

	General Factors Affecting Our Results of Operations
</B>
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Our business and results of operations are significantly affected by China&#146;s overall economic conditions and the general trends in the
	automotive industry, especially new automobile sales in China. Economic growth in China has contributed to an increase in household disposable income and improved the availability of financing for automobile purchases. These factors, coupled with
	increased production capacity and lower import tariffs, past governmental incentives designed to encourage automobile purchases and the decreasing cost of new automobiles, have contributed to the growth of the number of new automobiles sold in
	China. Although the automotive industry has benefited from China&#146;s overall favorable policies, some local governments have imposed restrictions on automobile registrations to curb traffic congestion and environment pollution in urban centers.
	If such regulations slow the growth rate of new automobile sales in China, the demand for our services would likely reduce. If overall advertising expenditures by automakers and automobile dealers or automobile transaction volume decrease, our
	business and results of operations may be adversely affected.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	In addition, our business and results of operations may be affected by our
	user reach and engagement. Automaker and dealer advertisers, which contribute a substantial portion of our revenues, choose to advertise on our websites and mobile applications in significant part due to our leading market position in the online
	automotive advertising industry. We anticipate that our ability to continue to attract a large and growing user base and maintain a high level of user engagement will affect our ability to attract advertisers and dealer subscribers to our websites
	and in turn, our ability to generate sales leads. Finally, our business and results of operations may be affected by the development of e-commerce in China and consumers&#146; acceptance of online automobile purchases.

	While our business and results of operations are generally affected by China&#146;s overall economic conditions, the general trends in

	Net Revenues

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	We primarily generate our
	net revenues from selling online advertising services and dealer subscription services. We sell our advertising services primarily to automakers and dealers, with automakers contributing a substantial majority of our advertising services revenues.
	As is customary in China, we sell our advertising services primarily through third-party advertising agencies while we consider automaker and dealer advertisers to be our end-customers. Consistent with common practice in the advertising industry in
	China, we offer rebates to advertising agencies. We also provide cash incentives to automakers and automobile dealers who participate in various incentive programs on our online transaction platform. Our net revenues are presented net of rebates to
	advertising agencies and cash incentives to automakers and automobile dealers. We sell our dealer subscription services to automobile dealers on a fixed-fee subscription basis.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	We also generate an insignificant portion of our net revenues from our transaction business. We record revenues from direct sales on gross
	basis when vehicles are delivered and title has passed to the consumers. In addition, we earn commissions from automakers for new vehicle transactions facilitated on Autohome Mall pursuant to commission-based service arrangements with automakers.

</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	We generate advertising services revenues primarily from automakers. In each of 2013, 2014 and 2015, 75, 85 and 87 automakers operating in
	China purchased advertising services from us. As a result of our high penetration in the automaker market, we believe that our future automaker advertising services revenue growth will be driven primarily by automakers&#146; increased advertising
	spending on our websites and mobile applications as they continue to shift their advertising budgets from traditional media to online media.

	Increased spending will be driven primarily by a combination of (i)&nbsp;our ability to increase
	advertising volume, either due to the availability of additional advertising locations as we expand our service offerings or due to higher sell-through rates, which is calculated as the percentage of advertising locations actually sold over total
	advertising locations available for sale in a given period and (ii)&nbsp;our ability to increase our pricing, as measured by price per location per day, as our user reach continues to expand, thereby enhancing the effectiveness of the services we
	offer. As is customary in China&#146;s online advertising market, we use a &#147;cost per time&#148; pricing model to price our online advertising services by charging our advertisers on a daily basis for an advertisement placed in a given location
	on our websites. We expect that this cost-per-time model will continue to be our primary pricing model in the near future. However, as we continue to grow our user base and enhance user engagement, we intend to explore &#147;cost per thousands
	impressions,&#148; &#147;cost per lead&#148; and other performance-based pricing models.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Revenues from dealer advertising services are
	generated from (i)&nbsp;advertising services sold to individual dealer advertisers, (ii)&nbsp;regional marketing campaigns conducted by certain automobile brands&#146; regional offices and (iii)&nbsp;our transaction business. Revenues from dealer
	advertising services accounted for 21.3%, 29.4% and 34.3% of our advertising services revenues in 2013, 2014 and 2015, respectively. We believe that our dealer advertising services revenues will continue to grow in absolute amounts in the near
	future, driven mainly by (i)&nbsp;the increase in the advertising budgets that automakers allocate to their dealers and (ii)&nbsp;our ability to increase our &#147;share of wallet&#148; relative to other online medias as we continue to expand into
	new geographical markets and penetrate deeper into existing markets to increase our customer base of automobile dealers. Our transaction business contribute a new growth driver as part of the dealer advertising revenues, including direct sales
	revenues and commission-based revenues.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	We generate dealer subscription services revenues through the sale of various subscription services packages at different prices, which enable
	dealers to market their vehicle inventories on our websites and mobile applications. All of our dealer subscription services are sold on a quarterly or annual fixed-fee basis.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	We offer basic automobile listing services free of charge to all of our registered dealers. We had 26,190 registered dealers as of
	December&nbsp;31, 2015, compared with 24,562 and 23,897 registered dealers as of December&nbsp;31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Our dealer subscribers are registered dealers that have purchased subscription packages. We provide our dealer
	subscribers with additional tools and features to enable them to more effectively market their inventories on our websites and mobile applications. Our dealer subscribers grew from 10,617 in 2013 to 17,779 in 2014 and 21,705 in 2015. Our dealer
	subscription services revenues accounted for 26.4%, 29.7% and 30.7% of our net revenues in 2013, 2014 and 2015, respectively. We believe that our dealer subscription services revenues will continue to grow in the near future, driven by our ability
	to subsequently convert registered dealers into dealer subscribers and command higher fees for different subscription packages by providing more value-added services to our dealer subscribers.

<I>
	Content-related Costs and Others
</I>
	. Content-related costs and others are costs directly
	related to creating and editing the professionally produced content and organizing and maintaining user generated content on our websites and mobile applications and new vehicle transaction business costs. Content-related costs mainly include
	salaries and benefits, toll free telephone charges, travel and office expenses of our editorial personnel, expenses we incur in the execution of the offline portion of our advertisers&#146; online promotions and expenses we pay to third parties for
	creating and publishing certain rich media content displayed on our websites. New vehicle transaction business costs primarily include cost of vehicle purchases and other directly attributable costs. Rebates relating to new vehicles purchased but
	still held by us as of the balance sheet date are recorded as a reduction to cost of inventories while rebates relating to new vehicles purchased and sold during the reporting period are recorded as a reduction to cost of revenues. We expect our
	content-related costs and others will continue to increase primarily due to our business growth. In addition, as a result of our adoption of the 2011 Share Incentive Plan and the 2013 Share Incentive Plan, our content-related costs and others in
	subsequent periods include share-based compensation expenses related to our editorial personnel.

<I>
	Depreciation and Amortization
	Expenses
</I>
	. A substantial majority of our amortization expenses relate to the amortization of intangibles including trademarks and customer relationships that we acquired in connection with the acquisitions of Cheerbright, China Topside and
	Norstar in June 2008, shortly after the inception of our company. Depreciation expenses are related to servers and other equipment that are directly related to our revenue-generating business activities and leasehold improvements. We expect our
	amortization expenses will decrease after the end of the estimated useful lives of certain intangible assets, while depreciation expenses will increase as we continue to invest in our business.

	Bandwidth and IDC Costs
</I>
	. Bandwidth and IDC costs consist of fees that we pay to telecommunication carriers and other service providers
	for telecommunication services and for hosting our servers at their internet data centers, as well as fees we pay to our content delivery network service provider for the distribution of our content. Our bandwidth and IDC costs continued to increase
	in subsequent periods as our user traffic continued to increase and we required more high quality bandwidth to support user traffic growth and improve our users&#146; experience.

	VAT and Surcharges
</I>
	. After VAT reform in 2012, our advertising services and dealer subscription services were subject to 6% VAT rate,
	and advertising services also subject to the cultural construction fee. Our dealer subscription service was sold in the form of software products starting from October 2014 and subject to 17% VAT rate. Since November 2014, Beijing Prbrownies
	Software Co., Ltd. was entitled to a 14% VAT refund on the total VAT payable at the rate of 17% after the registration of its software resolutions with the relevant authority. Our direct sales of vehicles were subject to 17% VAT rate. As a result of
	the above, our overall VAT and surcharges as a percentage of our total net revenues was 8.9% in 2013, 9.0% in 2014 and decreased to 8.3% in 2015.

	Under the PRC Enterprise Income Tax Law, an
	enterprise established outside of the PRC with &#147;de facto management bodies&#148; located within the PRC is considered a PRC resident enterprise and therefore will be subject to a 25% EIT on its global income. The implementation rules define
	&#147;de facto management bodies&#148; as &#147;establishments that carry out substantial and overall management and control over the manufacturing and business operations, personnel, accounting, properties, etc. of an enterprise.&#148; In addition,
	according to the Notice Regarding the Determination of Chinese-Controlled Offshore Incorporated Enterprises as PRC Tax Resident Enterprises on the Basis of De Facto Management Bodies issued by State Administration of Taxation, or SAT Circular 82, on
	April&nbsp;22, 2009, a Chinese-controlled enterprise established outside of China is treated as a PRC resident enterprise with &#147;de facto management bodies&#148; located in the PRC for tax purposes where all of the following requirements are
	satisfied: (a)&nbsp;the senior management and core management departments in charge of its daily production or business operations are located in the PRC; (b)&nbsp;its financial and human resource decisions are subject to determination or approval
	by persons or bodies in the PRC; (c)&nbsp;its major assets, accounting books, company seals, and minutes and files of its board and shareholders&#146; meetings are located or kept in the PRC; and (d)&nbsp;more than half of the enterprise&#146;s
	board members with voting rights or senior management habitually reside in the PRC. Despite the uncertainties resulting from limited PRC tax guidance on the issue, we do not believe that our legal entities organized outside of the PRC constitute PRC
	resident enterprises under the PRC Enterprise Income Tax Law. However, if we are considered a PRC resident enterprise and earn income other than dividends from our PRC subsidiaries, a 25% enterprise income tax on our global income could
	significantly increase our tax burden and materially and adversely affect our cash flow and profitability.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Further, the PRC Enterprise
	Income Tax Law and the implementation rules provide that an income tax rate of 10% may be applicable to China-sourced income of foreign enterprises, such as dividends paid by PRC subsidiaries to their overseas parent that is not a PRC resident
	enterprise, which (a)&nbsp;do not have an establishment or place of business in the PRC or (b)&nbsp;have an establishment or place of business in the PRC but the relevant income is not effectively connected with the establishment or place of
	business, unless there are applicable treaties that reduce such rate. The implementation rules of the new PRC Enterprise Income Tax Law provide that (a)&nbsp;if the enterprise that distributes dividends is domiciled in the PRC, or (b)&nbsp;if gains
	are realized from transferring equity interests of enterprises domiciled in the PRC, then such dividends or capital gains are treated as China-sourced income. It is not clear how &#147;domicile&#148; may be interpreted under the PRC Enterprise
	Income Tax Law, and it may be interpreted as the jurisdiction where the enterprise is a tax resident. Therefore, if we are considered as a PRC tax resident enterprise for tax purposes, any dividends we pay to our overseas shareholders or ADS holders
	as well as gains realized by such shareholders or ADS holders from the transfer of our shares or ADSs may be regarded as China-sourced income and as a result become subject to PRC withholding tax at the rate of 10%, subject to reduction by an
	applicable treaty. See &#147;Item&nbsp;3. Key Information&#151;D. Risk Factors&#151;Risks Related to Doing Business in China&#151;Our global income and the dividends that we may receive from our PRC subsidiaries, dividends distributed to our non-PRC
	shareholders and ADS holders, and gains recognized by such shareholders or ADS holders, may be subject to PRC taxes under the Enterprise Income Tax Law, which would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.&#148;

	We prepare our financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP, which requires us to make judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect
	the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the end of each reporting period and the reported amount of revenue and expenses during each reporting period. We evaluate these estimates and
	assumptions based on historical experience, knowledge and assessment of current business and other conditions and expectations that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Since the use of estimates is an integral component of the
	financial reporting process, actual results could differ from these estimates and assumptions.

	the application of such policies and (c)&nbsp;the sensitivity of reported results to changes in conditions and assumptions. For further information on our significant accounting policies, see Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements for 2013,
	2014 and 2015. We consider the policies discussed below to be critical to an understanding of our consolidated financial statements as their application places significant demands on the judgment of our management. We believe the following critical
	accounting policies are the most significant to the presentation of our financial statements and some of which may require the most difficult, subjective and complex judgments. They should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial
	statements, the risks and uncertainties of which are described under &#147;Item 3. Key Information&#151;D. Risk Factors&#148; and other disclosures included in this annual report.

	reassess such estimates periodically. Revenue is recognized ratably when the advertisements are published over the stated display period in the case of websites or when the services have been rendered in the case of promotional activities. The
	amount recognized is limited to the amount that is not contingent upon the delivery of additional deliverables or meeting other specified performance conditions.

	vehicle sales is recognized when a sales contract has been executed and the vehicle has been delivered. Under the commission-based service arrangements, the Company earns commission for the new vehicle transactions facilitated through our Autohome
	Mall platform. Commission revenue is recognized after the vehicles are delivered to customers. For the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2015, the revenues from new vehicle transaction business accounted for 5.2% of our consolidated net revenues and
	therefore, were not separately disclosed as a separate line item but included in advertising services in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income.

	(US$370.5 million) in 2015. This increase was due to our increased revenues from both automaker advertisers and dealer advertisers, of which transaction business contributed a new growth driver as part of the dealer advertising revenues. Revenues
	from our automaker advertisers and dealer advertisers accounted for 65.7% and 34.3%, respectively, of our total advertising services revenues in 2015. Revenues from our automaker advertisers and dealer advertisers accounted for 70.6% and 29.4%,
	respectively, of our total advertising services revenues in 2014. In 2013, 2014 and 2015, 75, 85 and 87 automakers operating in China used our advertising services, respectively. In 2014 and 2015, dealers involving over 100 brands used our

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The
	increase in revenues from our automaker advertisers was attributable to a 45.7% increase in average revenues per automaker advertiser from RMB12.4 million in 2014 to RMB18.1 million (US$2.8 million) in 2015, as automakers continued to allocate more
	of their advertising budgets to Autohome&#146;s online advertising channels. The increase in dealer advertising services revenues was mainly due to (i)&nbsp;the Company&#146;s new vehicle transaction business, which is primarily composed of direct
	vehicle sales and commission-based services facilitating transactions through our platform; and (ii)&nbsp;the increase in the volume of pure advertising purchased by the Company&#146;s growing base of paying dealers to drive better performance. For
	the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2015, the revenue from new vehicle transaction business accounted for 7.5% of our total advertising services revenues. If we exclude this, the average revenue per vehicle brand of dealer advertiser increased by 45.4%
	from RMB4.1 million in 2014 to RMB6.0 million (US$0.9 million) in 2015.

	revenues increased by 68.0% from RMB633.4 million in 2014 to RMB1,064.0 million (US$164.2 million) in 2015. The increase in dealer subscription services revenues was mainly driven by (i)&nbsp;a 22.1% year-over-year increase in the number of paying
	dealers, which in turn was a result of Autohome&#146;s expansion into new geographic markets, especially within China&#146;s growing tier 3 and 4 cities, as well as deeper penetration into existing markets; and (ii)&nbsp;a 37.6% increase in average
	revenue per paying subscriber from RMB35.6 thousand in 2014 to RMB49.0 thousand in 2015, and rates for dealer subscription services as dealers continue to allocate a greater portion of their budgets to the Company&#146;s subscription services. The
	Company sold dealer subscription services to 21,705 dealers in 2015, compared with 17,779 dealers in 2014.

	. Our net revenues increased by 75.3% from RMB1,216.5 million in 2013 to
	RMB2,132.9 million in 2014. This increase was due to increases in both our advertising services revenues and our dealer subscription services revenues.

	Advertising services
</I>
	. Our advertising services revenues increased by 67.6% from RMB894.9 million in 2013 to RMB1,499.5 million in 2014.
	This increase was due to our increased revenues from both automaker advertisers and dealer advertisers. Revenues from our automaker advertisers and dealer advertisers accounted for 70.6% and 29.4%, respectively, of our total advertising services
	revenues in 2014. Revenues from our automaker advertisers and dealer advertisers accounted for 78.7% and 21.3%, respectively, of our total advertising services revenues in 2013.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The increase in revenues from our automaker advertisers was attributable to an increase in average revenues per automaker advertiser, as
	automakers continued to allocate more of their advertising budget to Autohome&#146;s online advertising channels. The increase in dealer advertising services revenues was mainly due to an increase in the volume of advertising purchased by dealer
	advertisers as a result of our expansion into new geographic markets and deeper penetration into existing markets, as well as an increase in the rates for our dealer advertising services.

	. Dealer subscription services revenues increased by 97.0% from RMB321.6 million in 2013 to RMB633.4
	million in 2014. The increase in dealer subscription services revenues was mainly due to (i)&nbsp;an increase in the number of paying subscribers, which in turn was a result of our expansion into new geographic markets and deeper penetration into
	existing markets and (ii)&nbsp;an increase in average revenue per paying subscriber as dealers continue to allocate a greater portion of their budget to subscribe to our services and an increase in the rates for our dealer subscription services. We
	sold dealer subscription services to 17,779 dealers in 2014, compared with 10,617 dealers in 2013.

	. Our sales and marketing expenses increased by 128.0% from

	number of restricted shares granted to any employee. The administrator may impose whatever conditions to vesting it determines to be appropriate. For example, the administrator may set restrictions based on the achievement of specific performance
	goals and/or continued service to us. Holders of restricted share awards generally will have voting rights but not dividend rights, unless the administrator provides otherwise. Restricted shares that do not vest for any reason will be forfeited by

	Under Cayman Islands law, our directors have a duty of loyalty to act honestly in good faith with a view to our best interests. Our directors
	also owe to our company a duty to act with skill and care. It was previously considered that a director need not exhibit in the performance of his or her duties a greater degree of skill than may reasonably be expected from a person of his or her
	knowledge and experience. However, English and Commonwealth courts have moved towards an objective standard with regard to the required skill and care and these authorities are likely to be followed in the Cayman Islands. In fulfilling their duty of
	care to us, our directors must ensure compliance with our memorandum and articles of association. Our company has the right to seek damages if a duty owed by our directors is breached.

	the number of registrable shares as such holders may request. We, however, are not obligated to effect a demand registration if the dollar amount of securities to be sold to the public is of an aggregate price less than US$5.0 million; and we are
	not obligated to effect a demand registration if, among other things, we have already filed three demand registrations and each of such registrations has been declared effective. We have the right to defer filing of a registration statement for up

	The following discussion is a summary of United States federal income tax considerations relating to the ownership and disposition of our ADSs
	or Class&nbsp;A ordinary shares by U.S. Holders (as defined below) that will hold ADSs or Class&nbsp;A ordinary shares as &#147;capital assets&#148; (generally, property held for investment) under the United States Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
	amended (the &#147;Code&#148;). This discussion is based upon applicable provisions of the Internal Revenue Code, Treasury regulations (proposed, temporary and final) promulgated thereunder, pertinent judicial decisions, interpretive rulings of the
	Internal Revenue Service and such other authorities as we have considered relevant, which are subject to change, possibly with retroactive effect. This discussion does not address all aspects of United States federal income taxation that may be
	important to particular investors in light of their individual investment circumstances, including investors subject to special tax rules (for example, certain financial institutions, insurance companies, broker-dealers, pension plans, regulated
	investment companies, real estate investment trusts, cooperatives, and tax-exempt organizations (including private foundations), holders who are not U.S. Holders, holders who own (directly, indirectly, or constructively) 10% or more of our voting
	stock, investors that will hold their ADSs or Class&nbsp;A ordinary shares as part of a straddle, hedge, conversion, constructive sale, or other integrated transaction for United States federal income tax purposes, investors that are traders in
	securities that have elected the mark-to-market method of accounting, or investors that have a functional currency other than the United States dollar), all of whom may be subject to tax rules that differ significantly from those discussed below. In
	addition, this discussion does not address United States federal estate, gift, Medicare, and alternative minimum tax considerations, or any non-United States, state, or local tax considerations. Each U.S. Holder is urged to consult its tax advisors
	regarding the United States federal, state, local, and non-United States income and other tax considerations of an investment in ADSs or Class&nbsp;A ordinary shares.

	A non-United States corporation, such as our company, will be classified as a &#147;passive foreign investment company&#148; (or a
	&#147;PFIC&#148;), for United States federal income tax purposes for any taxable year, if either (i)&nbsp;75% or more of its gross income for such year consists of certain types of &#147;passive&#148; income or (ii)&nbsp;50% or more of the value of
	its assets (determined on the basis of a quarterly average) during such year produce or are held for the production of passive income (the &#147;asset test&#148;). Passive income generally includes dividends, interest, royalties, rents, annuities,
	net gains from the sale or exchange of property producing such income and net foreign currency gains. For this purpose, cash is categorized as a passive asset and the company&#146;s goodwill and other unbooked intangibles associated with active
	business activity are taken into account as non-passive assets. We will be treated as owning our proportionate share of the assets and earning our proportionate share of the income of any other corporation in which we own, directly or indirectly,
	more than 25% (by value) of the stock.

	Although the law in this regard is unclear, we treat our VIEs as being owned by us for United
	States federal income tax purposes, not only because we exercise effective control over the operation of such entities but also because we are entitled to substantially all of their economic benefits, and, as a result, we consolidate their results
	of operation in our consolidated financial statements. If it were determined, however, that we are not the owner of our VIEs for United States federal income tax purposes, we would likely be treated as a PFIC for our current and any subsequent
	taxable year.

	Furthermore, the determination of whether we will be or become a PFIC will depend, in part, on
	the composition of our income and assets. Fluctuations in the market price of our ADSs may cause us to become a PFIC for the current or subsequent taxable years because the value of assets for the purpose of the asset test may be determined by
	reference to the market price of our ADSs. The composition of our income and assets may also be affected by how, and how quickly, we use our liquid assets. Under circumstances where our revenue from activities that produce passive income
	significantly increase relative to our revenue from activities that produce non-passive income, or where we determine not to deploy significant amounts of cash for active purposes, our risk of becoming classified as a PFIC may substantially
	increase. In addition, because there are uncertainties in the application of the relevant rules, it is possible that the Internal Revenue Service may challenge our classification of certain income and assets as non-passive or our valuation of our
	tangible and intangible assets, each of which may result in our becoming a PFIC for the current or subsequent taxable years.

	Assuming we
	are the owner of our VIEs for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we believe that we primarily operate as an active provider of online automotive advertising solutions in China. Based on our current income and assets, we do not believe that we were a
	PFIC for the taxable year ended December&nbsp;31, 2015 and do not anticipate becoming a PFIC in future taxable years. While we do not believe that we were a PFIC for the taxable year ended December&nbsp;31, 2015 and do not anticipate becoming a PFIC
	for the current taxable year or the foreseeable future, no assurance can be given in this regard. Because the determination of whether we will be or become a PFIC is a fact-intensive inquiry made on an annual basis, the determination of whether we
	will be or become a PFIC will depend, in part, upon the value of our goodwill and other unbooked intangibles (which will depend upon the market value of our ADSs from time to time, which may be volatile). In estimating the value of our goodwill and
	other unbooked intangibles, we have taken into account our current market capitalization. If our market capitalization subsequently declines, we may be or become classified as a PFIC for the current taxable year or future taxable years. It is also
	possible that the Internal Revenue Service may challenge our classification or valuation of our goodwill and other unbooked intangibles, which may result in our company being or becoming a PFIC for the current taxable year or foreseeable future.

	be a PFIC in subsequent years. The discussion below under &#147;Dividends&#148; and &#147;Sale or Other Disposition of ADSs or Class&nbsp;A Ordinary Shares&#148; is written on the basis that we will not be classified as a PFIC for United States

	Any cash distributions (including the amount of any PRC tax withheld) paid on ADSs or Class&nbsp;A ordinary shares out of our earnings and
	profits, as determined under United States federal income tax principles, will generally be includible in the gross income of a U.S. Holder as dividend income on the day actually or constructively received by the U.S. Holder, in the case of
	Class&nbsp;A ordinary shares, or by the depositary bank, in the case of ADSs. Because we do not intend to determine our earnings and profits on the basis of United States federal income tax principles, any distribution paid will generally be treated
	as a &#147;dividend&#148; for United States federal income tax purposes. Non-corporate U.S. Holders receiving dividend income generally will be subject to tax on such dividend income from a &#147;qualified foreign corporation&#148; at a lower
	applicable capital gains rate rather than the marginal tax rates generally applicable to ordinary income provided that certain holding period and other requirements are met. A non-United States corporation (other than a corporation that is
	classified as a PFIC for the taxable year in which the dividend is paid or the preceding taxable year) generally will be considered to be a qualified foreign corporation (i)&nbsp;with respect to any dividend it pays on stock (or ADSs in respect of
	such stock) which is readily tradable on an established securities market in the United States, or (ii)&nbsp;if it is eligible for the benefits of a comprehensive tax treaty with the United States that the Secretary of Treasury of the United States
	determines is satisfactory for purposes of this provision and that includes an exchange of information program. Our ADSs are listed on the NYSE, which is an established securities market in the United States, and will be considered readily tradable
	on an established securities market for as long as the ADSs continue to be listed on such exchange. Thus, we believe that we will be a qualified foreign corporation with respect to dividends we pay on our ADSs, but there can be no assurance that our
	ADSs will continue to be considered readily tradable on an established securities market in later years.

	Since we do not expect that our Class&nbsp;A ordinary shares be listed on established securities

	If we are a PFIC for any taxable year during which a U.S. Holder holds our ADSs or Class&nbsp;A ordinary shares and any of our non-United
	States subsidiaries is also a PFIC (i.e., a lower-tier PFIC), such U.S. Holder would be treated as owning a proportionate amount (by value) of the shares of the lower-tier PFIC and would be subject to the rules described above on certain
	distributions by a lower-tier PFIC and a disposition of shares of a lower-tier PFIC even though such U.S. Holder would not receive the proceeds of those distributions or dispositions. U.S. Holders are urged to consult their tax advisors regarding

	As an alternative to the foregoing rules, a U.S. Holder of &#147;marketable
	stock&#148; in a PFIC may make a mark-to-market election with respect to our ADSs, provided that the ADSs are regularly traded on the NYSE. We anticipate that the ADSs should qualify as being regularly traded, but no assurances may be given in this
	regard. If a U.S. Holder makes this election, the U.S. Holder will generally (i)&nbsp;include as ordinary income for each taxable year the excess, if any, of the fair market value of ADSs held at the end of the taxable year over the adjusted tax
	basis of such ADSs and (ii)&nbsp;deduct as an ordinary loss the excess, if any, of the adjusted tax basis of such ADSs over the fair market value of such ADSs held at the end of the taxable year, but such deduction will be allowed only to the extent
	of the amount previously included in income as a result of the mark-to-market election. The U.S. Holder&#146;s adjusted tax basis in the ADSs would be adjusted to reflect any income or loss resulting from the mark-to-market election. If a U.S.
	Holder makes a mark-to-market election in respect of a corporation classified as a PFIC and such corporation ceases to be classified as a PFIC, the U.S. Holder will not be required to take into account the gain or loss described above during any
	year that such corporation is not classified as a PFIC. If a U.S. Holder makes a mark-to-market election, any gain such U.S. Holder recognizes upon the sale or other disposition of our ADSs in a year when we are a PFIC will be treated as ordinary
	income and any loss will be treated as ordinary loss, but such loss will only be treated as ordinary loss to the extent of the net amount previously included in income as a result of the mark-to-market election. In the case of a U.S. Holder who has
	held ADSs or Class&nbsp;A ordinary shares during any taxable year in respect of which we were classified as a PFIC and continues to hold such ADSs or Class&nbsp;A ordinary shares (or any portion thereof) and has not previously made a mark-to-market
	election, and if such U.S. Holder makes a mark-to-market election, special tax rules may apply relating to purging the PFIC taint of such ADSs or Class&nbsp;A ordinary shares.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Because, as a technical matter, a mark-to-market election cannot be made for any lower-tier PFICs that we may own, a U.S. Holder may continue

	We earn substantially all of our revenues and incur most of our expenses in RMB, and substantially all of our sales contracts are denominated
	in RMB. We do not believe that we currently have any significant direct foreign exchange risk and have not used any derivative financial instruments to hedge our exposure to such risk. Although in general, our exposure to foreign exchange risks
	should be limited, the value of your investment in our ADSs will be affected by the exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and the RMB because the value of our business is effectively denominated in RMB, while the ADSs will be traded in U.S. dollars.
	Based on the amount of our cash and cash equivalents and term deposits as of December&nbsp;31, 2015, a 1.0% change in the exchange rate between the Renminbi and the U.S. dollar would result in an increase or decrease of approximately US$1.4 million

	Significant revaluation of RMB against U.S. dollar may materially affect our earnings
	and financial position, the conversion of RMB into foreign currencies, including U.S. dollars, is based on rates set by the People&#146;s Bank of China. In July 2005, the PRC government changed its decades-old policy of pegging the value of the RMB
	to the U.S. dollar, and the RMB appreciated more than 20% against the U.S. dollar over the following three years. Between July 2008 and June 2010, this appreciation halted and the exchange rate between the RMB and the U.S. dollar remained within a
	narrow band. Since June 2010, the RMB has fluctuated against the U.S. dollar, at times significantly and unpredictably. It is difficult to predict how market forces or PRC or U.S. government policy may impact the exchange rate between the RMB and
	the U.S. dollar in the future.

	To the extent that we need to convert U.S. dollars into RMB for capital expenditures and working capital
	and other business purposes, appreciation of the RMB against the U.S. dollar would have an adverse effect on the RMB amount we would receive from the conversion. Conversely, if we decide to convert RMB into U.S. dollars for the purpose of making
	payments for dividends on our ordinary shares or ADSs, strategic acquisitions or investments or other business purposes, appreciation of the U.S. dollar against the RMB would have a negative effect on the U.S. dollar amount available to us.

	The depositary fees payable upon the issuance and
	cancellation of ADSs are typically paid to the depositary bank by the brokers (on behalf of their clients) receiving the newly issued ADSs from the depositary bank and by the brokers (on behalf of their clients) delivering the ADSs to the depositary
	bank for cancellation. The brokers in turn charge these fees to their clients. Depositary fees payable in connection with distributions of cash or securities to ADS holders and the depositary services fee are charged by the depositary bank to the
	holders of record of ADSs as of the applicable ADS record date.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The depositary fees payable for cash distributions are generally deducted
	from the cash being distributed or by selling a portion of distributable property to pay the fees. In the case of distributions other than cash (i.e., share dividends, rights), the depositary bank charges the applicable fee to the ADS record date
	holders concurrent with the distribution. In the case of ADSs registered in the name of the investor (whether certificated or uncertificated in direct registration), the depositary bank sends invoices to the applicable record date ADS holders. In
	the case of ADSs held in brokerage and custodian accounts (via DTC), the depositary bank generally collects its fees through the systems provided by DTC (whose nominee is the registered holder of the ADSs held in DTC) from the brokers and custodians
	holding ADSs in their DTC accounts. The brokers and custodians who hold their clients&#146; ADSs in DTC accounts in turn charge their clients&#146; accounts the amount of the fees paid to the depositary banks.

	preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP and includes those policies and procedures that (i)&nbsp;pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions
	and dispositions of a company&#146;s assets, (ii)&nbsp;provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles,
	and that a company&#146;s receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of a company&#146;s management and directors, and (iii)&nbsp;provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
	unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of a company&#146;s assets that could have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements. Our management, with the participation of our chief executive officer and chief financial officer,
	conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our company&#146;s internal control over financial reporting as of December&nbsp;31, 2015 based on criteria established in Internal Control&#151;Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of
	Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 Framework). Based on this evaluation, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December&nbsp;31, 2015.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	We have

<B>

	cash flows and changes in shareholders&#146;

	statements based on our audits.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United
	States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the
	amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that
	our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all
	material respects, the consolidated financial position of Autohome Inc. at December 31, 2015 and 2014, and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2015, in conformity
	with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight

	Commission (2013 framework) and our report dated March 17, 2016 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

	The Company, its subsidiaries and VIEs are hereinafter collectively referred to as the &#147;Group&#148;. The
	Group provides online advertising and dealer subscription services through its websites and mobile applications. These services are offered to automakers and dealers, and advertising agencies that represent automakers and dealers in the automobile
	industry. In 2015, the Group further developed transaction business which includes direct vehicle sales and commission-based services facilitating transactions through the transaction platform. The Group&#146;s principal geographic market is in the
	PRC. The Company does not conduct any substantive operations of its own but conducts its primary business operations through its wholly-owned subsidiaries and VIEs in the PRC.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	PRC laws and regulations prohibit or restrict foreign ownership of internet content and online advertising businesses. To comply with these foreign ownership
	restrictions, the Company and its subsidiaries operate websites and provide online advertising services and dealer subscription services in the PRC through VIEs. The paid-in capital of the VIEs was funded by the Company&#146;s PRC subsidiaries,
	Autohome WFOE and Chezhiying WFOE, through loans extended to the VIEs&#146; shareholders (&#147;Nominee Shareholders&#148;). The effective control of the VIEs is held by WFOEs, through a series of contractual agreements (the &#147;Contractual
	Agreements&#148;). As a result of the Contractual Agreements, the WFOEs maintain the ability to control the VIEs, are entitled to substantially all of the economic benefits from the VIEs and are obligated to absorb all of the VIE&#146;s expected
	losses.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	In July 2015, Autohome Information, Shengtuo Hongyuan and Autohome WFOE entered into a termination agreement, pursuant to which the parties
	terminated the contractual agreements among themselves and Autohome Information transferred all of its equity interest in Shengtuo Hongyuan to James Zhi Qin and Zheng Fan. In July 2015, Chezhiying WFOE, Shengtuo Hongyuan and each of its
	subsidiaries, and James Zhi Qin and Zheng Fan entered into contractual agreements to effect the Company&#146;s control over Shengtuo Hongyuan. The terms of these agreements are substantially the same as the contractual agreements between Autohome
	WFOE and each of the three shareholders of Autohome Information described below. This termination of contractual agreements and transfer of equity interest in Shengtuo Hongyuan from Autohome WFOE to Chezhiying WFOE had no impact on the
	Company&#146;s operations and consolidated financial statements.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Despite the lack of technical majority ownership, there exists a parent-subsidiary
	relationship between the Company and the VIEs through the irrevocable power of attorney agreement, whereby the Nominee Shareholders effectively assigned all of their voting rights underlying their equity interest in the VIEs to the WFOEs. In
	addition, through the Contractual Agreements the Company demonstrates its ability and intention to continue to exercise the ability to absorb substantially all of the expected losses and majority of the profits of the VIEs through the WFOEs.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Thus, the Company is also considered the primary beneficiary of the VIEs through the WFOEs. As a result of the above, the Company consolidates the VIEs in

	Internet and advertising related businesses are subject to significant restrictions under current PRC laws and regulations. Specifically, foreign investors are
	not allowed to own more than a 50% equity interest in any Internet Content Provider (&#147;ICP&#148;) business. In addition, PRC regulations require any foreign entities that invest in the advertising services industry to have at least a two-year
	track record with a principal business in the advertising industry outside of China.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The Group conducts its operations in China through Contractual
	Agreements entered into between the WFOEs and VIEs. In 2014, the Group began gradually migrating the advertising service business from the VIEs to the subsidiaries of Autohome Media, a transition that was completed to a substantial extent. The
	relevant regulatory authorities may find the current contractual agreements and businesses to be in violation of any existing or future PRC laws or regulations. If the Company or any of its current or future VIEs or subsidiaries are found in
	violation of any existing or future laws or regulations, or fail to obtain or maintain any of the required permits or approvals, the relevant PRC regulatory authorities would have broad discretion in dealing with such violations, including levying
	fines, confiscating the income of Autohome WFOE, Chezhiying WFOE, Shanghai Advertising, Guangzhou Advertising, Autohome Information and its subsidiaries, revoking the business licenses or operating licenses of Autohome WFOE, Chezhiying WFOE,
	Shanghai Advertising, Guangzhou Advertising, Autohome Information and its subsidiaries, shutting down the Group&#146;s servers or blocking the Group&#146;s websites, discontinuing or placing restrictions or onerous conditions on the Group&#146;s
	operations, requiring the Group to undergo a costly and disruptive restructuring, restricting the Group&#146;s rights to use the proceeds from this offering to finance the Group&#146;s business and operations in China, or enforcement actions that
	could be harmful to the Group&#146;s business. Any of these actions could cause significant disruption to the Group&#146;s business operations and severely damage the Group&#146;s reputation, which would in turn materially and adversely affect the
	Group&#146;s business and results of operations. In addition, if the imposition of any of these penalties causes the Company to lose the rights to direct the actives of VIEs or the Company&#146;s right to receive their economic benefits, the Company
	would no longer be able to consolidate the VIEs.

	In addition, if Shanghai Advertising, Guangzhou Advertising, Autohome Information and its subsidiaries
	or their shareholders fail to perform their obligations under the Contractual Agreements, the Company may have to incur substantial costs and expend resources to enforce the Company&#146;s rights under the contracts. The Company may have to rely on
	legal remedies under PRC law, including seeking specific performance or injunctive relief and claiming damages, which may not be effective. All of these Contractual Agreements are governed by PRC law and provide for the resolution of disputes
	through arbitration in the PRC. Accordingly, these contracts would be interpreted in accordance with PRC law and any disputes would be resolved in accordance with PRC legal procedures. The legal system in PRC is not as developed as in other
	jurisdictions, such as United States. As a result, uncertainties in the PRC legal system could limit the Company&#146;s ability to enforce these Contractual Agreements. Under PRC law, rulings by arbitrators are final, parties cannot appeal the
	arbitration results in courts, and prevailing parties may only enforce the arbitration awards in PRC courts through arbitration award recognition proceedings, which would incur additional expenses and delay. In the event the Company is unable to
	enforce these Contractual Agreements, the Company may not be able to exert effective control over its VIEs, and the Company&#146;s ability to conduct its business may be negatively affected.

	Based on the advice of the Company&#146;s PRC legal counsel, the corporate structure and Contractual Agreements of the Company&#146;s VIEs and WFOEs in China

	Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the amounts assigned to the

	350,

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level on an annual basis (December 31 for the Company) and between annual tests if an event occurs or
	circumstances change that would more-likely-than-not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value. These events or circumstances include a significant change in stock prices, business environment, legal factors, financial
	performances, competition, or events affecting the reporting unit. Application of the goodwill impairment test requires judgment, including the identification of reporting units, assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units, assignment of
	goodwill to reporting units, and determination of the fair value of each reporting unit. The estimation of fair value of reporting unit using a discounted cash flow methodology also requires significant judgments, including estimation of future cash
	flows, which is dependent on internal forecasts, estimation of the long-term rate of growth for the Company&#146;s business, estimation of the useful life over which cash flows will occur, and determination of the Company&#146;s weighted average
	cost of capital. The estimates used to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit change from year to year based on operating results and market conditions. Changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of
	fair value and goodwill impairment for the reporting unit.

	Management has determined that the Group represents the lowest level within the entity at which goodwill is

	are recognized when a sales contract has been executed and the vehicle has been delivered. Under the commission-based service arrangements, the Company earns commission for the new vehicle transactions facilitated through the Autohome Mall platform.
	Commission revenue is recognized after the vehicles are delivered to customers. For the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2015, the revenues from new vehicle transaction business accounted for 5.2% of the consolidated net revenues of the Company and

	the vesting period) in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income. The Company has elected to recognize compensation expense using the straight-line method for all share-based awards granted with service conditions that have a graded
	vesting schedule. ASC 718 requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from initial estimates.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Forfeiture rates are estimated based on historical and future expectations of employee turnover rates and are adjusted to reflect future changes in
	circumstances and facts, if any. Share-based compensation expense is recorded net of estimated forfeitures such that expense is recorded only for those share-based awards that are expected to vest. To the extent the Company revises these estimates
	in the future, the share-based payments could be materially impacted in the period of revision, as well as in following periods. The Company, with the assistance of an independent third-party valuation firm, determined the fair value of the stock
	options granted to employees. The binomial option pricing model was applied in determining the estimated fair value of the options granted to employees. Subsequent to the IPO, fair value of the ordinary shares will be the price of the Company&#146;s
	publicly traded shares.

	Financial instruments that potentially subject the Group to significant concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents,
	restricted cash, term deposits and accounts receivable. As of December&nbsp;31, 2014 and 2015, cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash and term deposits altogether amounting to RMB2,772,191 and RMB4,169,053 (US$643,591), respectively, were
	deposited with various major reputable financial institutions located in the PRC and international financial institutions outside of the PRC. Management believes that these financial institutions are of high credit quality and continually monitors
	the creditworthiness of these financial institutions. Historically, deposits in Chinese banks are secure due to the state policy on protecting depositors&#146; interests. However, China promulgated a new Bankruptcy Law in August 2006 that came into
	effect on June&nbsp;1, 2007, which contains a separate article expressly stating that the State Council may promulgate implementation measures for the bankruptcy of Chinese banks based on the Bankruptcy Law. Under the new Bankruptcy Law, a Chinese
	bank may go into bankruptcy. In the event of bankruptcy of one of the banks which holds the Group&#146;s deposits, it is unlikely to claim its deposits back in full since it is unlikely to be classified as a secured creditor based on PRC laws. The
	Group continues to monitor the financial strength of these financial institutions.

	have a negative effect on the U.S. dollar amount available to the Company. In addition, a significant depreciation of the RMB against the U.S. dollar may significantly reduce the U.S. dollar equivalent of the Company&#146;s earnings, which in turn

	The New EIT Law also provides that enterprises established under the laws of foreign countries or regions and
	whose &#147;place of effective management&#148; is located within the PRC are considered PRC tax resident enterprises and subject to PRC income tax at the rate of 25% on worldwide income. The definition of &#147;place of effective management&#148;
	refers to an establishment that exercises, in substance, overall management and control over the production and business, personnel, accounting, properties, and other aspects of an enterprise. As of December&nbsp;31, 2015, no detailed interpretation

	In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, the Group has considered whether it is more-likely-than-not that some
	portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible. The
	Group records a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to a net amount that management believes is more-likely-than-not of being realizable based on the weight of all available evidence. The Company recorded valuation allowances against
	the deferred tax assets of five VIEs as of December&nbsp;31, 2014 and eleven PRC subsidiaries and VIEs as of December&nbsp;31, 2015, respectively, due to the cumulative tax loss positions and insufficient forecasted future taxable income.

	and RMB2,330,698 (US$359,798), respectively. As of December&nbsp;31, 2014 and 2015, determination of the amount of unrecognized deferred tax liability related to the earnings that are indefinitely reinvested is not practical.

	nil, respectively, are presented on a net basis against the deferred tax assets related to tax loss carry forwards on the consolidated balance sheets. This primarily represents the estimated income tax expense the Group would pay should its income
	tax returns have been prepared in accordance with the current PRC tax laws and regulations. It is possible that the amount of uncertain tax position will change in the next twelve months, however, an estimate of the range of the possible outcomes

	As of December&nbsp;31, 2014 and 2015, the Group has recognized liabilities of RMB24,058 and RMB32,596 (US$5,032), respectively, related to unrecognized tax
	benefits (Note 6). The final outcome of the tax uncertainty is dependent upon various matters including tax examinations, interpretation of tax laws or expiration of statutes of limitation. However, due to the uncertainties associated with the
	status of examinations, including the protocols of finalizing audits by the relevant tax authorities, there is a high degree of uncertainty regarding the future cash outflows associated with these tax uncertainties. The Group classified the accrual
	for unrecognized tax benefits as a non-current liability.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	With respect to display advertising services, consistent with industry practice in the PRC, the
	Company regularly provides such services at a discount to its standard rates. These discounts are in the form of free advertising elements, of which the duration and other terms of services are specified as part of the revenue contract. The VAT
	pilot program replaced the business tax rules for advertising services in Beijing effective from September&nbsp;1, 2012. There are uncertainties under the current VAT rules as to whether these free elements should constitute deemed services in
	addition to the chargeable elements rather than discounts to the overall revenue arrangements for tax purposes and thus be subject to VAT at the standard rates of services. The Company currently considers that such free elements do not give rise to
	deemed services for VAT purposes and the value-added tax for a revenue contract is calculated based on the contract price for the overall arrangements. The rules related to the VAT pilot program are still evolving and the timing of the promulgation
	of the final tax rules or related interpretation is uncertain. The estimated amount of this contingency as of December&nbsp;31, 2015 is not determinable.

	Upon the effectiveness of the IPO registration statement, the Company&#146;s ordinary shares were redeemed and cancelled in consideration for the issuance of
	an equivalent number of Class&nbsp;A ordinary shares and Class B ordinary shares to the holders of former ordinary shares, respectively. Holders of Class&nbsp;A ordinary shares and Class B ordinary shares have the same rights except for conversion
	and voting rights. Each Class B ordinary share is convertible into one Class&nbsp;A ordinary share at any time, while Class&nbsp;A ordinary shares cannot be converted into Class B ordinary shares under any circumstances. Each Class&nbsp;A ordinary
	share is entitled to one vote. When the total number of ordinary shares held by Telstra constitutes no less than 51% of all of the Company&#146;s issued and outstanding ordinary shares, each Class B ordinary share is entitled to one vote; when the
	total number of ordinary shares held by Telstra drops below 51% but is no less than 39.3% of all of the Company&#146;s issued and outstanding ordinary shares, each Class B ordinary share will carry such number of votes that would result in the total

	The Company&#146;s ability to pay dividends is primarily dependent on the Company receiving distributions of funds from its subsidiaries.
	Relevant PRC statutory laws and regulations permit payments of dividends by the Company&#146;s PRC subsidiaries only out of its retained earnings, if any, as determined in accordance with PRC accounting standards and regulations. The results of
	operations reflected in the consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S.GAAP differ from those reflected in the statutory financial statements of the Company&#146;s PRC subsidiaries.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Under PRC law, the Company&#146;s PRC subsidiaries are required to provide for certain statutory reserves, namely a general reserve, an enterprise expansion
	fund and a staff welfare and bonus fund. The subsidiary is required to allocate at least 10% of their after tax profits on an individual company basis as determined under PRC accounting standards to the general reserve and has the right to
	discontinue allocations to the general reserve if such reserve has reached 50% of registered capital on an individual company basis. In addition, the registered capital of the Company&#146;s PRC subsidiaries and VIEs is also restricted.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Appropriations to the enterprise expansion fund and staff welfare and bonus fund are at the discretion of the Board of Directors of the subsidiary. The
	Company&#146;s VIEs in the PRC are also subject to similar statutory reserve requirements. These reserves can only be used for specific purposes and are not transferable to the Group in the form of loans, advances or cash dividends. As of
	December&nbsp;31, 2013, 2014 and 2015, the Company&#146;s PRC subsidiaries and VIEs had appropriated RMB7,113, RMB8,836 and RMB19,175 (US$2,960), respectively, of retained earnings for its statutory reserves.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	As a result of these PRC laws and regulations subject to the limit discussed above that require annual appropriations of 10% of after-tax income to be set
	aside, prior to payment of dividends as general reserve fund, the Company&#146;s PRC subsidiaries and VIEs are restricted in their ability to transfer a portion of their net assets to the Company. Foreign exchange and other regulations in the PRC
	may further restrict the Company&#146;s PRC subsidiaries and VIEs from transferring funds to the Company in the form of dividends, loans and advances. As of December&nbsp;31, 2014 and 2015, amounts restricted are the net assets of the Company&#146;s
	PRC subsidiaries and VIEs, which amounted to RMB2,626,141 and RMB3,740,507 (US$577,435), respectively.

	The weighted average grant-date fair value of restricted shares granted during the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2013, 2014
	and 2015 was US$12.38, US$37.30 and US$34.70, respectively, which was derived from the fair value of the underlying ordinary shares. The total grant date fair value of restricted shares vested during the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2013, 2014 and
	2015 was nil, RMB7,925 and RMB38,104 (US$5,882). The aggregate fair value of the outstanding restricted shares at the grant dates were determined to be RMB367,550 (US$56,740) and such amount shall be recognized as compensation expense using the
	straight-line method for all restricted shares granted with graded vesting. As of December&nbsp;31, 2015, there was RMB297,344 (US$45,902) of total unrecognized share-based compensation expenses, net of estimated forfeitures, related to unvested
	restricted shares which are expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 2.89 years. Total unrecognized compensation expenses may be adjusted for future changes in estimated forfeitures.

	The binomial option pricing model was applied in determining the estimated fair value of the options granted to employees. The model requires the input of
	highly subjective assumptions including the estimated expected stock price volatility and the exercise multiple for which employees are likely to exercise share options. For expected volatilities, the Company has made reference to the historical
	price volatilities of ordinary shares of several comparable companies in the same industry as the Company. For the exercise multiple, the Company has no historical exercise patterns as reference, thus the exercise multiple is based on
	management&#146;s estimation, which the Company believes is representative of the future exercise pattern of the options. The risk-free rate for periods within the contractual life of the option is based on the U.S. Treasury Bills yield curve in
	effect at the time of grant. The estimated fair value of the ordinary shares, at the option grant dates prior to the IPO, was determined with assistance from an independent third party valuation firm. The Company&#146;s management is ultimately
	responsible for the determination of the estimated fair value of its ordinary shares. Subsequent to the IPO, fair value of the ordinary shares was the price of the Company&#146;s publicly traded shares.
