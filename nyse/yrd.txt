	by retaining current participants and attracting more users. We intend to continue to dedicate significant resources to our user
	acquisition efforts, including establishing new acquisition channels, particularly as we continue to grow our marketplace and
	introduce new loan products. We utilize online channels, such as search engine marketing, search engine optimization and partnerships
	with internet companies, as well as CreditEase&rsquo;s on-the-ground sales network for user acquisition. In 2013, 2014 and 2015,

	the effectiveness of our risk control, the repayment rate of borrowers on our marketplace, the efficiency of our platform, the
	macroeconomic environment and other factors. In connection with the introduction of new products or in response to general economic
	conditions, we may also impose more stringent borrower qualifications to ensure the quality of loans on our platform, which may
	negatively affect the growth of loan volume. In addition, although we have entered into a cooperation framework agreement with
	CreditEase, pursuant to which CreditEase will provide us offline user acquisition services, we cannot assure you that we will
	receive sufficient support from CreditEase after our carve-out from CreditEase. If any of our current user acquisition channels

	we may not be able to attract new borrowers and investors in a cost-effective manner or convert potential borrowers and investors

	The Guidelines call for active government support of China&rsquo;s
	internet finance industry, including the online peer-to-peer lending service industry, and clarify the division of responsibility
	among regulatory agencies. The Guidelines specify that the China Banking Regulatory Commission, or the CBRC, will have primary
	regulatory responsibility for the online peer-to-peer lending service industry in China and state that online peer-to-peer lending
	service providers should operate as information intermediaries and are prohibited from engaging in illegal fund-raising and providing
	&ldquo;credit enhancement services,&rdquo; which we believe are generally perceived in the online peer-to-peer lending industry
	to mean providing guarantees to investors in relation to the return of loan principal and interest. This interpretation is based
	upon comments made at a public forum held on September 27, 2014, during which a senior CBRC officer mentioned several requirements
	that the CBRC is contemplating for future regulation of the peer-to-peer lending service industry, which include, among others,
	that a peer-to-peer lending service provider (i) is neither a credit intermediary bearing credit risk nor a transaction platform,
	but an information intermediary between lenders and borrowers, (ii) should not hold investors&rsquo; funds or set up any capital
	pools, and (iii) must not provide guarantees for lenders in relation to the loan principal and interest, or bear any system risk
	or liquidity risk. In addition to prohibiting illegal fund-raising and the provision of &ldquo;credit enhancement services,&rdquo;
	the Guidelines provide additional requirements for China&rsquo;s internet finance industry, including the use of custody accounts
	with qualified banks to hold customer funds as well as information disclosure requirements, among others. However, the Guidelines
	only set out the basic principles for promoting and administering the online peer-to-peer lending service industry, and were not
	accompanied by any implementing rules. The Guidelines instead urge the relevant regulatory agencies to adopt implementing rules
	at the appropriate time.

	Intermediaries, as the financial information intermediaries that are engaged in peer-to-peer lending information business and
	provide lenders and borrowers with lending information services, such as information collection and publication, credit rating,
	information interaction and loan facilitation. In consistency with the Guidelines, the Draft Measures prohibit the Information

	To comply with existing rules, laws, regulations and governmental
	policies relating to the peer-to-peer lending service industry, we have implemented various policies and procedures, which we
	believe set the best practice in the industry, including, without limitation, the following: (i)&nbsp;we do not use our own capital
	to invest in loans facilitated through our online marketplace; (ii)&nbsp;we do not commit to provide guarantees to investors under
	any agreement for the full return of loan principal and interest; (iii)&nbsp;we do not hold investors&rsquo; funds and funds loaned
	through our platform are deposited into and settled by a third-party custody account managed by a qualified bank, China Guangfa
	Bank; (iv)&nbsp;we have obtained the internet information services license, or the ICP license, as an internet information provider
	from the relevant local counterpart of the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology in accordance with applicable laws;
	(v) we fully disclose on our website all relevant information to investors and borrowers, such as disclosure to borrowers regarding
	interest rates, payment schedule, transaction fees, and other charges and penalties; and (vi)&nbsp;we have been making strong
	effort to maintain the security of our platform and the confidentiality of the information provided and utilized across our platform.
	However, due to the lack of detailed rules and the fact that the rules, laws and regulations are expected to continue to evolve
	in this newly emerging industry, we cannot be certain that our existing practices would not be deemed to violate any existing
	or future rules, laws and regulations.

	In particular, we cannot rule out the possibility that some
	of the services we provide to investors, such as the automated investing tool and our services to a trust, might be viewed as
	not being in full compliance. Our automated investing tool automatically allocates committed funds from multiple investors among
	multiple approved borrowers, which goes beyond the simple one-to-one matching between investors and borrowers and could be viewed
	as violating some of these requirements. In addition, if our automated investing tool fails to match committed investors with
	approved borrowers in a timely manner, we might be deemed to hold investors&rsquo; funds and form a capital pool incidentally.
	As part of our strategy to expand our investor base from individual investors to institutional investors, in October 2015 we established
	a business relationship with a trust in a pilot program that we are evaluating under which the trust invested in loans through
	our platform using funds received from its investor, which is also its sole beneficiary. The trust is administered by an independent
	third-party state-owned trust company, which acts as the trustee, for the purposes of providing returns to its sole beneficiary
	through extending loans up to an aggregate principal amount of RMB250 million (US$38.6 million) to borrowers recommended by our
	platform. The trust&rsquo;s settlor and sole beneficiary is a fund managed by Zhe Hao Shanghai Asset Management Company, or Zhe
	Hao, an affiliate of CreditEase. In April 2016, Zhe Hao, on behalf of the fund, transferred the fund&rsquo;s entire beneficiary
	rights in the trust to China International Capital Corporation Limited, a special purpose vehicle, which has proposed to issue
	and list asset-backed securities on the Shenzhen Stock Exchange in China, with the loans invested by the trust through our platform
	as the underlying assets. The fund&rsquo;s investors are PRC individuals who are not affiliated with our company. Although we
	are not part of the fund-raising process by the trust or the fund, we cannot assure you that our provision of services to the
	trust will not be viewed by PRC regulators as violating any laws or regulations regarding capital pools. Also, we transferred
	cash to the trust in an amount equal to 6% of the entire assets put into the trust by the trust&rsquo;s settlor which were fully
	used to invest in loans on our platform, as a security fund to protect the trust from potential losses from defaults of loans
	in which the trust has invested. Under limited circumstances, the remainder of this fund may be returned to us, and we cannot
	assure you that we will not be viewed by PRC regulators as bearing some credit risk or providing credit enhancement services under
	such arrangement.

	Moreover, although the Guidelines prohibit online peer-to-peer
	lending service providers from providing &ldquo;credit enhancement services,&rdquo; it is uncertain how the &ldquo;credit enhancement
	services&rdquo; mentioned in the Guidelines will be interpreted due to the lack of detailed implementing rules in the Guidelines.
	However, given (i) the prohibition by the Draft Measures on providing security or guarantee of principals and interests to lenders,
	and (ii) the requirements mentioned by the CBRC officer during the public forum held on the September 27, 2014, we believe it
	is generally perceived in the online peer-to-peer lending industry to mean providing guarantees to investors in relation to the
	return of loan principal and interest. Under our risk reserve fund arrangement, if a loan is delinquent for a certain period of
	time, we may withdraw a sum from the risk reserve fund to repay investors the principal and accrued interest for the defaulted
	loan unless the risk reserve fund is depleted. In order to continue to attract new and retain existing investors and to remain
	consistent with the current industry practice in China, our current risk reserve funding policy aims to have sufficient cash in
	the risk reserve fund to cover expected payouts, which is based on our current business intention but not legal obligation. Subject
	to the terms and limits in our agreements with investors, we currently allow investors to fully recover their outstanding principal
	and accrued interest in the event of loan default. We intend to continue this practice for the foreseeable future. However, as
	the industry continues to evolve and becomes more sophisticated and our business develops, we may revisit our policy or the terms
	on which we offer the risk reserve fund service such that investors may recover less than 100% of the outstanding principal and
	accrued interest of the defaulted loan. Although the purpose of the risk reserve fund is to limit investor losses due to borrower
	defaults and not to provide investors with guarantees in relation to the return of loan principal and interest, we cannot rule
	out the possibility that our current risk reserve fund model or any variations thereof might be viewed by the PRC regulatory bodies
	as providing, to a certain extent, a form of guarantee or otherwise a form of &ldquo;credit enhancement service&rdquo; prohibited
	under the Guidelines. Furthermore, if the risk reserve fund is viewed by the PRC regulatory bodies as providing a form of guarantee,
	under the Provisions on Several Issues Concerning Laws Applicable to Trials of Private Lending Cases, or the Private Lending Judicial
	Interpretations, issued by the Supreme People&rsquo;s Court on August&nbsp;6, 2015 and being effective on September 1, 2015, if
	requested by the investor with the court, we may be required to assume the obligations as to the defaulted loan as a guarantor.
	For a summary of the Private Lending Judicial Interpretations, see &ldquo;Item 4. Information on the Company&mdash;B. Business
	Overview&mdash;Regulation&mdash;Regulations Relating to Online Peer-to-Peer Lending&mdash;Regulations on Loans between Individuals.&rdquo;

	As of the date of this annual report, we have not been subject
	to any material fines or other penalties under any PRC laws or regulations including those governing the peer-to-peer lending
	service industry in China. The Guidelines do not set out the liabilities that will be imposed on the service providers who fail
	to comply with the principles and requirements contained thereunder, nor do other applicable rules, laws and regulations contain
	specific liability provisions specially as to the peer-to-peer lending platform or similar online marketplace like us. However,
	if our practice is deemed to violate any rules, laws or regulations, we may face injunctions, including orders to cease illegal
	activities, and may be exposed to other penalties as determined by the relevant government authorities as well. If such situations
	occur, our business, financial condition and prospects would be materially and adversely affected. In addition, given the evolving
	regulatory environment in which we operate, we cannot rule out the possibility that the PRC government will institute a licensing
	regime covering our industry. If such a licensing regime were introduced, we cannot assure you that we would be able to obtain
	any newly required license in a timely manner, or at all, which could materially and adversely affect our business and impede
	our ability to continue our operations.

	Investments in loans on our marketplace involve inherent risks
	as the return of the principal on a loan investment made through our platform is not guaranteed, although we aim to limit investor
	losses due to borrower defaults to within an industry acceptable range through various preventive measures we have taken or will
	take. Our ability to attract borrowers and investors to, and build trust in, our marketplace is significantly dependent on our
	ability to effectively evaluate a borrower&rsquo;s credit profile and maintain low default rates. To conduct this evaluation,
	we have employed a series of procedures and developed a proprietary credit assessment and decisioning model. Our credit scoring
	model aggregates and analyzes the data submitted by a borrower as well as the data we collect from a number of internal and external
	sources, and then generates an Yirendai score for the prospective borrower. The score will be further used to approve and classify
	the borrower into one of the four segments in our current pricing grid. If our credit scoring model contains programming or other
	errors, is ineffective or the data provided by borrowers or third parties is incorrect or stale, our loan pricing and approval
	process could be negatively affected, resulting in misclassified or mispriced loans or incorrect approvals or denials of loans.
	If we are unable to effectively and accurately assess the credit profiles of borrowers, segment borrowers into appropriate grade
	in the pricing grid, or price loans on our platform appropriately, we may either be unable to offer attractive fee rates to borrowers
	and returns to investors, or unable to maintain low default rates of loans facilitated by our platform. In addition, once a loan
	application is approved, we do not further monitor certain aspects of the borrower&rsquo;s credit profile, such as changes in
	the borrower&rsquo;s credit report and the borrower&rsquo;s purchasing pattern with online merchants. If the borrower&rsquo;s
	financial condition deteriorates, we may not be able to take measures to prevent default on the part of the borrower and thereby
	maintain low default rates for loans facilitated by our platform. The borrowers that we currently serve, including those falling
	under Grade&nbsp;A, B, C and D of our pricing grid, are prime borrowers. If we expand to serve new borrower groups beyond prime
	borrowers in the future, we may find it difficult or unable to maintain low default rates of loans facilitated through our marketplace.
	Although we offer investor protection services in the form of a risk reserve fund, if widespread defaults were to occur, investors
	may still incur losses and lose confidence in our marketplace and our business and results of operations may be materially and
	adversely affected.

	If default rates were to increase, we may set aside additional
	cash in our risk reserve fund and recognize additional expenses and liabilities on our financial statements, which could have
	a material adverse effect on our working capital, financial conditions, results of operations and business operations. We also
	may not have or generate sufficient cash to replenish our risk reserve fund when necessary. In addition, because we offer investor
	protection in the form of a risk reserve fund, high default rates would adversely affect the profitability of our loan products.
	Particularly, as our Grade A loans have an average transaction fee rate of 5.6%, which is lower than the average transaction fee
	rates for our other grades of loans, any failure to achieve a low default rate for our Grade A loans will diminish our profit
	margin and may even cause us to incur losses. Historically, Grade A loans have been unprofitable. For the historical lifetime

	Since we commenced our online consumer finance business only
	in March 2012, we have limited information regarding the default rates on loans facilitated through our platform. In addition,
	given our limited operating history and recent introduction of new products, we have limited information on historical charge-off
	rates, and we may not be able to accurately forecast charge-offs for our target borrower group. Given these challenges, it is
	possible that we will under- or over-fund our risk reserve fund. If we under-fund our risk reserve fund, and we do not or are
	unable to replenish the risk reserve fund to a sufficient level in time, investors may not be fully protected from loss. This
	may result in negative sentiment among investors, potentially hindering our ability to retain existing investors as well as to
	attract new investors, and investors may bring claims against us, whether or not they have legal rights to seek damages from us,
	which could lead to additional expenses and distract management&rsquo;s attention from our business operation. Conversely, if
	we over-fund our risk reserve fund, this will reduce the amount of our working capital, as we cannot use the funds set aside in
	the risk reserve fund for our operations, and cause us to lose business opportunities. Should any of the foregoing occur, our
	competitive position as well as our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.

	Another example is the automated investing tool that we offer
	to investors. With our automated investing tool, an investor may lend to borrowers on our marketplace for a specified period of
	time, and the investor&rsquo;s funds are automatically allocated among approved borrowers. However, we cannot rule out the possibility
	that there may be a mismatch between the investor&rsquo;s expected timing of exit and the maturity date of the loans to which
	the automated investing tool allocates the investor&rsquo;s funds. Investors using our automated investing tool typically invest
	for a shorter period than the terms of the underlying loans. If we are unable to find another investor to take over the remainder
	of the loans from the original investor that uses our automated investing tool at the time of his expected exit, then the original
	investor will have to remain invested in the loans and his expectation of liquidity would not be satisfied. If such mismatches
	occur in a widespread manner, investor acceptance of or satisfaction with our automatic investing tool would be adversely impacted.

	The online consumer finance marketplace industry in China is

	promotion, sale and support of their platforms. Our competitors may also have longer operating histories, more extensive borrower

	and in order to grow or maintain the volume of loan transactions facilitated through our marketplace, we may have to offer higher

	In addition, our business of connecting investors and individual

	contracts, under the PRC Contract Law. Under the PRC Contract Law, an intermediary may not claim for service fee and is liable

	an intermediation contract, which results in harm to the client&rsquo;s interests. See &ldquo;Item 4. Information on the Company&mdash;B.

	received from borrowers or others and in turn provide such information to investors, and in either case if we are also found to
	be at fault, due to failure or deemed failure to exercise proper care, such as to conduct adequate information verification or
	employee supervision, we could be held liable for damages caused to investors as an intermediary pursuant to the PRC Contract
	Law. In addition, if we fail to complete our obligations under the agreements entered into with investors and borrowers, we could
	also be held liable for damages caused to borrowers or investors pursuant to the PRC Contract Law. On the other hand, we do not
	assume any liability solely on the basis of failure to correctly assign a loan grade to a particular borrower in the process of
	facilitating a loan transaction, as long as we do not conceal any material fact intentionally or provide false information, and
	are not found to be at fault otherwise. However, due to the lack of detailed regulations and guidance in the area of peer-to-peer
	lending services and the possibility that the PRC government authority may promulgate new laws and regulations regulating peer-to-peer
	lending services in the future, there are substantial uncertainties regarding the interpretation and application of current or

	products and platform. These efforts may prove more expensive than we currently anticipate, and we may not succeed in increasing
	our revenue sufficiently to offset these higher expenses. There are other factors that could negatively affect our financial conditions.
	For example, the default rates of the loans facilitated through our platform may be higher than expected, which may lead to lower
	than expected net revenues and additional expenses in connection with the higher than expected payouts from the risk reserve fund.
	Furthermore, we have adopted a share incentive plan, and we may grant equity-based awards to eligible participants from time to
	time under the plan, which will result in share-based compensation expenses to us. As a result of the foregoing and other factors,
	our net revenue growth may slow, our net income margins may decline or we may incur additional net losses in the future and may
	not be able to maintain profitability on a quarterly or annual basis. In addition, our net revenue growth rate will likely decline
	as our net revenue grows to higher levels.

	million in 2015. Our cash generated from operating activities primarily includes the transaction fees from borrowers. Historically,
	borrowers paid the transaction fees primarily on a monthly basis over the term of the loan, which has contributed to our generating
	negative cash flows from operating activities. In the fourth quarter of 2014, we adopted a new fee collection schedule whereby
	we either collect the entire amount of the transaction fee upfront upon completion of our loan facilitation services, or collect
	a portion of the transaction fee upfront and the rest on a monthly basis over the term of the loan. However, we cannot assure
	you the new fee collection schedule will improve our cash position. Inability to collect payments from customers, borrowers in
	particular, in a timely and sufficient manner may adversely affect our liquidity, financial condition and results of operations.
	Furthermore, in the first three quarters of 2015, the amount of cash we have set aside for the risk reserve fund is not sufficient
	to cover all expected payouts for loans facilitated during this period. In the event the actual or expected risk reserve payouts
	are higher than the risk reserve fund balance, we will or may need to, as the case may be, increase the amount of cash that is

	monetary and fiscal policies adopted by the central banks and financial authorities of some of the world&rsquo;s leading economies,
	including the United States and China. There have also been concerns over unrest in Ukraine, the Middle East and Africa, which
	have resulted in volatility in financial and other markets. There have also been concerns about the economic effect of the tensions
	in the relationship between China and surrounding Asian countries. If present Chinese and global economic uncertainties persist,
	many of our investors may delay or reduce their investment in the loans facilitated through our platform. Adverse economic conditions
	could also reduce the number of qualified borrowers seeking loans on our platform, as well as their ability to make payments.
	Should any of these situations occur, the amount of loans facilitated through our platform and our net revenues will decline,
	and our business and financial conditions will be negatively impacted. Additionally, continued turbulence in the international
	markets may adversely affect our ability to access the capital markets to meet liquidity needs.

	We have limited experience operating as a stand-alone company.
	We commenced our online consumer finance marketplace business in March 2012, and Yirendai Ltd. was incorporated in 2014 in the
	Cayman Islands as a wholly owned subsidiary of CreditEase. Founded in 2006 by our executive chairman, Mr. Ning Tang, CreditEase
	is a large financial services company focusing on providing inclusive finance and wealth management products and services in China.
	Inclusive finance includes peer-to-peer lending and focuses on providing access to affordable and responsible financing solutions
	to those in China who are often unable to gain such access. We completed our carve-out from CreditEase in the first quarter of
	2015. Historically, CreditEase has provided us with origination and servicing, financial, administrative, sales and marketing,
	risk management, human resources and legal services, and also with the services of a number of its executives and employees. Although
	we have become a stand-alone company, we expect CreditEase to continue to provide us with certain support services during a transitional
	period. We have also relied on CreditEase for the successful operation of our online consumer finance marketplace. In the future,
	we expect to continue to rely on CreditEase for various aspects of our operations, such as risk management, offline acquisition
	of new borrowers and investors and outstanding loan collection services. Although we have entered into a series of agreements
	with CreditEase relating to our ongoing business cooperation and service arrangements with CreditEase, we cannot assure you that
	we will continue to receive the same level of support from CreditEase after we become a stand-alone company. The cost of services
	which CreditEase provides to us may from time to time increase based on commercial negotiations between CreditEase and us. For
	example, pursuant to our contractual agreement with CreditEase, the fee rate for the offline borrower acquisition services which
	CreditEase provides to us has recently increased from 5% to 6% of the loans facilitated to borrowers referred by CreditEase for
	the three years starting 2016. After that, the fee rate may be adjusted on a yearly basis based on commercial negotiation, and
	after taking into consideration the costs to CreditEase for providing such services and with reference to market rates. Furthermore,

	Prior to the establishment of Yirendai Ltd., our online consumer
	finance marketplace business was carried out by various subsidiaries and variable interest entities of CreditEase. We completed
	our carve-out from CreditEase in the first quarter of 2015, and all of our online consumer finance marketplace business is now
	carried out by our own subsidiaries and consolidated variable interest entities. Since we and the subsidiaries and variable interest
	entities of CreditEase that operated our online marketplace business are under common control of CreditEase, our consolidated
	financial statements include the assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses and cash flows that were directly attributable to our
	business for all periods presented. In particular, our consolidated balance sheets include those assets and liabilities that are
	specifically identifiable to our business; and our consolidated statements of operations include all costs and expenses related
	to us, including costs and expenses allocated from CreditEase to us. Allocations from CreditEase, including amounts allocated
	to origination and servicing expenses, sales and marketing expenses and general and administrative expenses, were made using a
	proportional cost allocation method and based on headcount or transaction volume for the provision of services attributable to
	us. We made numerous estimates, assumptions and allocations in our historical financial statements because we did not operate
	as a stand-alone company prior to our carve-out from CreditEase in the first quarter of 2015. Although our management believes
	that the assumptions underlying our historical financial statements and the above allocations are reasonable, our historical financial
	statements may not necessarily reflect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows as if we had operated as a
	stand-alone company during those periods. See &ldquo;Item 7. Major Shareholders and Related Party Transactions&mdash;B. Related
	Party Transactions&rdquo; for our arrangements with CreditEase and &ldquo;Item 5. Operating and Financial Review and Prospects&rdquo;
	and the notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report for our historical cost allocation.
	In addition, upon becoming a stand-alone company, we have established our own financial, administrative and other support systems
	to replace CreditEase&rsquo;s systems, the cost of which may have been significantly different from cost allocation with CreditEase
	for the same services. Therefore, you should not view our historical results as indicators of our future performance.

	Prior to our initial public offering, we were a wholly-owned
	subsidiary of CreditEase, and after our initial public offering, CreditEase remains as our controlling shareholder. We have benefited
	significantly and expect to continue to benefit significantly from our association with CreditEase in marketing our brand and
	our marketplace. Referrals from CreditEase&rsquo;s on-the-ground sales network currently accounts for a majority of our borrowers
	and loan volume. In 2013, 2014 and 2015, 54.2%, 48.1% and
<FONT STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	49.5
</FONT>
	% of our borrowers were acquired
	through referrals from CreditEase, respectively, contributing 61.9%, 59.8% and
<FONT STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	67.0
</FONT>
	% of the
	total amount of loans facilitated through our marketplace, respectively. If user referrals through CreditEase decrease or become
	less effective, the quality of the borrowers referred by CreditEase does not meet our borrower qualification standards, or if
	we are unable to continue to use CreditEase as a user acquisition channel for any reason, our business and results of operations
	may be adversely and materially affected. Although transaction values through online consumer finance marketplaces in China are
	expected to grow from RMB4.6 billion in 2014 to RMB247.6 billion in 2019, according to iResearch, there can be no assurance that
	we would be able to find other user acquisition channels to replace referrals from CreditEase on commercially reasonable terms,
	or at all. We also benefit from CreditEase&rsquo;s strong brand recognition in China, which provides us credibility and a broad
	marketing reach. If CreditEase loses its market position, the effectiveness of our marketing efforts through our association with
	CreditEase may be materially and adversely affected. In addition, any negative publicity associated with CreditEase or any negative
	development in respect of CreditEase&rsquo;s market position, financial conditions, or in terms of compliance with legal or regulatory
	requirements in China, will likely have an adverse impact on the effectiveness of our marketing as well as our reputation and
	brand.

	We have entered into a series of agreements with CreditEase

	As of March 31, 2016, CreditEase held 85.5% of our outstanding

	CreditEase&rsquo;s voting control may cause transactions that

	market price. In addition, CreditEase is not prohibited from selling a controlling interest in us to a third party and may do
	so without the approval of the holders of our ADSs and without providing for a purchase of the ADSs. If CreditEase is acquired

	It is uncertain whether any new PRC laws, rules or regulations
	relating to variable interest entity structures will be adopted or if adopted, what they would provide. In particular, in January
	2015, the Ministry of Commerce, or MOC, published a discussion draft of the proposed Foreign Investment Law for public review
	and comments. Among other things, the draft Foreign Investment Law expands the definition of foreign investment and introduces
	the principle of &ldquo;actual control&rdquo; in determining whether a company is considered a foreign-invested enterprise, or
	an FIE. Under the draft Foreign Investment Law, variable interest entities would also be deemed as FIEs, if they are ultimately
	&ldquo;controlled&rdquo; by foreign investors, and be subject to restrictions on foreign investments. However, the draft law has
	not taken a position on what actions will be taken with respect to the existing companies with the &ldquo;variable interest entity&rdquo;
	structure, whether or not these companies are controlled by Chinese parties. It is uncertain when the draft would be signed into
	law and whether the final version would have any substantial changes from the draft. See &ldquo;Item 4. Information on the Company&mdash;B.
	Business Overview&mdash;Regulation&mdash;Regulations Relating to Foreign Investment&mdash;The Draft PRC Foreign Investment Law&rdquo;
	and &ldquo;&mdash;Substantial uncertainties exist with respect to the enactment timetable, interpretation and implementation of
	draft PRC Foreign Investment Law and how it may impact the viability of our current corporate structure, corporate governance
	and business operations&rdquo; below. If the ownership structure, contractual arrangements and business of our company, Heng Ye
	or Heng Cheng are found to be in violation of any existing or future PRC laws or regulations, or we fail to obtain or maintain
	any of the required permits or approvals, the relevant governmental authorities would have broad discretion in dealing with such
	violation, including levying fines, confiscating our income or the income of Heng Ye or Heng Cheng, revoking the business licenses
	or operating licenses of Heng Ye or Heng Cheng, shutting down our servers or blocking our online platform, discontinuing or placing
	restrictions or onerous conditions on our operations, requiring us to undergo a costly and disruptive restructuring, restricting
	or prohibiting our use of proceeds from our initial public offering to finance our business and operations in China, and taking
	other regulatory or enforcement actions that could be harmful to our business. Any of these actions could cause significant disruption
	to our business operations and severely damage our reputation, which would in turn materially and adversely affect our business,
	financial condition and results of operations. If any of these occurrences results in our inability to direct the activities of
	Heng Cheng, and/or our failure to receive economic benefits from Heng Cheng, we may not be able to consolidate its results into
	our consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP.

	All the agreements under our contractual arrangements are governed
	by PRC laws and provide for the resolution of disputes through arbitration in China. Accordingly, these contracts would be interpreted
	in accordance with PRC laws and any disputes would be resolved in accordance with PRC legal procedures. The legal system in the
	PRC is not as developed as in some other jurisdictions, such as the United States. As a result, uncertainties in the PRC legal
	system could limit our ability to enforce these contractual arrangements. Meanwhile, there are very few precedents and little
	formal guidance as to how contractual arrangements in the context of a consolidated variable interest entity should be interpreted
	or enforced under PRC laws. There remain significant uncertainties regarding the ultimate outcome of such arbitration should legal
	action become necessary. In addition, under PRC laws, rulings by arbitrators are final and parties cannot appeal arbitration results
	in court unless such rulings are revoked or determined unenforceable by a competent court. If the losing parties fail to carry
	out the arbitration awards within a prescribed time limit, the prevailing parties may only enforce the arbitration awards in PRC
	courts through arbitration award recognition proceedings, which would require additional expenses and delay. In the event that
	we are unable to enforce these contractual arrangements, or if we suffer significant delay or other obstacles in the process of

	While the Chinese economy has experienced significant growth
	over the past decades, growth has been uneven, both geographically and among various sectors of the economy. The Chinese government
	has implemented various measures to encourage economic growth and guide the allocation of resources. Some of these measures may
	benefit the overall Chinese economy, but may have a negative effect on us. For example, our financial condition and results of
	operations may be adversely affected by government control over capital investments or changes in tax regulations. In addition,
	in the past the Chinese government has implemented certain measures, including interest rate increases, to control the pace of
	economic growth. These measures may cause decreased economic activity in China, and since 2012, China&rsquo;s economic growth
	has slowed down. Any prolonged slowdown in the Chinese economy may reduce the demand for our products and services and materially
	and adversely affect our business and results of operations.

	In particular, PRC laws and regulations concerning the peer-to-peer

	Moreover, developments in the peer-to-peer lending service industry may lead to changes in PRC laws, regulations and policies

	finance marketplaces like us, which could materially and adversely affect our business and operations. Furthermore, we cannot

	From time to time, we may have to resort to administrative

	in interpreting and implementing statutory and contractual terms, it may be more difficult to evaluate the outcome of administrative
	and court proceedings and the level of legal protection we enjoy than in more developed legal systems. Furthermore, the PRC legal
	system is based in part on government policies and internal rules (some of which are not published in a timely manner or at all)
	that may have retroactive effect. As a result, we may not be aware of our violation of these policies and rules until sometime
	after the violation. Such uncertainties, including uncertainty over the scope and effect of our contractual, property (including

	The MOC published a discussion draft of the proposed Foreign
	Investment Law in January 2015 aiming to, upon its enactment, replace the trio of existing laws regulating foreign investment
	in China, namely, the Sino-foreign Equity Joint Venture Enterprise Law, the Sino-foreign Cooperative Joint Venture Enterprise
	Law and the Wholly Foreign-invested Enterprise Law, together with their implementation rules and ancillary regulations. The draft
	Foreign Investment Law embodies an expected PRC regulatory trend to rationalize its foreign investment regulatory regime in line
	with prevailing international practice and the legislative efforts to unify the corporate legal requirements for both foreign
	and domestic investments. The MOC is currently soliciting comments on this draft and substantial uncertainties exist with respect
	to its enactment timetable, interpretation and implementation. The draft Foreign Investment Law, if enacted as proposed, may materially
	impact the viability of our current corporate structure, corporate governance and business operations in many aspects.

<P STYLE="FONT: 10PT TIMES NEW ROMAN, TIMES, SERIF; MARGIN: 0PT 0">
	Among other things, the draft Foreign Investment Law expands
	the definition of foreign investment and introduces the principle of &ldquo;actual control&rdquo; in determining whether a company
	is considered a foreign-invested enterprise, or an FIE. The draft Foreign Investment Law specifically provides that entities established
	in China but &ldquo;controlled&rdquo; by foreign investors will be treated as FIEs. Once an entity is considered to be an FIE,
	it may be subject to the foreign investment restrictions or prohibitions set forth in a &ldquo;negative list&rdquo; to be separately
	issued by the State Council later. If an FIE proposes to conduct business in an industry subject to foreign investment &ldquo;restrictions&rdquo;
	in the &ldquo;negative list,&rdquo; the FIE must go through a market entry clearance by the MOC before being established. If an
	FIE proposes to conduct business in an industry subject to foreign investment &ldquo;prohibitions&rdquo; in the &ldquo;negative
	list,&rdquo; it must not engage in the business. However, an FIE that is subject to foreign investment &ldquo;restrictions,&rdquo;
	upon market entry clearance, may apply in writing for being treated as a PRC domestic investment if it is ultimately &ldquo;controlled&rdquo;
	by PRC government authorities and its affiliates and/or PRC citizens. In this connection, &ldquo;control&rdquo; is broadly defined
	in the draft law to cover the following summarized categories: (i)&nbsp;holding 50% or more of the voting rights of the subject
	entity; (ii)&nbsp;holding less than 50% of the voting rights of the subject entity but having the power to secure at least 50%
	of the seats on the board or other equivalent decision making bodies, or having the voting power to exert material influence on
	the board, the shareholders&rsquo; meeting or other equivalent decision making bodies; or (iii)&nbsp;having the power to exert
	decisive influence, via contractual or trust arrangements, over the subject entity&rsquo;s operations, financial matters or other
	key aspects of business operations. Once an entity is determined to be an FIE, it will be subject to the foreign investment restrictions
	or prohibitions set forth in a &ldquo;negative list,&rdquo; to be separately issued by the State Council at a later date, if the
	FIE is engaged in an industry listed in the negative list.&nbsp;Unless the underlying business of the FIE falls within the negative
	list, which calls for market entry clearance by the MOC, prior approval from the government authorities as mandated by the existing
	foreign investment legal regime would no longer be required for establishment of the FIE.

	The &ldquo;variable interest entity&rdquo; structure, or VIE
	structure, has been adopted by many PRC-based companies, including us, to obtain necessary licenses and permits in the industries
	that are currently subject to foreign investment restrictions in China. See &ldquo;&mdash;Risks Related to Our Corporate Structure&rdquo;
	and &ldquo;Item 4. Information on the Company &mdash; C. Organizational Structure.&rdquo; Under the draft Foreign Investment Law,
	variable interest entities that are controlled via contractual arrangement would also be deemed as FIEs, if they are ultimately
	&ldquo;controlled&rdquo; by foreign investors. Therefore, for any companies with a VIE structure in an industry category that
	is included in the &ldquo;negative list&rdquo; as restricted industry, the VIE structure may be deemed legitimate only if the
	ultimate controlling person(s) is/are of PRC nationality (either PRC companies or PRC citizens). Conversely, if the actual controlling
	person(s) is/are of foreign nationalities, then the variable interest entities will be treated as FIEs and any operation in the
	industry category on the &ldquo;negative list&rdquo; without market entry clearance may be considered as illegal.

	It is uncertain whether we would be considered as ultimately

	Although Mr.&nbsp;Ning Tang, our executive chairman and a PRC citizen, owns less than 50% of the voting power of CreditEase, he
	has the power to appoint three directors on the five-member board of CreditEase. It is uncertain, however, if these factors would
	be sufficient to give Mr.&nbsp;Tang control over us under the draft Foreign Investment Law. Moreover, the draft Foreign Investment
	Law has not taken a position on what actions will be taken with respect to the companies currently employing a VIE structure,
	whether or not these companies are controlled by Chinese parties, while it is soliciting comments from the public on this point.
	In addition, it is uncertain whether the online consumer finance marketplace industry, in which our variable interest entity operates,
	will be subject to the foreign investment restrictions or prohibitions set forth in the &ldquo;negative list&rdquo; that is to
	be issued. If the enacted version of the Foreign Investment Law and the final &ldquo;negative list&rdquo; mandate further actions,
	such as MOC market entry clearance or certain restructuring of our corporate structure and operations, to be completed by companies
	with existing VIE structure like us, there may be substantial uncertainties as to whether we can complete these actions in a timely
	manner, or at all, and our business and financial condition may be materially and adversely affected.

	foreign-invested enterprises from, among other things, using RMB fund converted from its foreign exchange capitals for expenditure
	beyond its business scope, providing entrusted loans or repaying loans between non-financial enterprises. In addition, SAFE strengthened
	its oversight of the flow and use of the RMB capital converted from foreign currency registered capital of a foreign-invested
	company. The use of such RMB capital may not be altered without SAFE&rsquo;s approval, and such RMB capital may not in any case
	be used to repay RMB loans if the proceeds of such loans have not been used. Violations of Circular 19 could result in severe
	monetary or other penalties. These circulars may significantly limit our ability to use RMB converted from the cash provided by

	Under the PRC Enterprise Income Tax Law and its implementation
	rules, an enterprise established outside of the PRC with a &ldquo;de facto management body&rdquo; within the PRC is considered
	a resident enterprise and will be subject to the enterprise income tax on its global income at the rate of 25%. The implementation
	rules define the term &ldquo;de facto management body&rdquo; as the body that exercises full and substantial control over and
	overall management of the business, productions, personnel, accounts and properties of an enterprise. In April 2009, the State
	Administration of Taxation issued a circular, known as Circular 82, which provides certain specific criteria for determining whether
	the &ldquo;de facto management body&rdquo; of a PRC-controlled enterprise that is incorporated offshore is located in China. Although
	this circular only applies to offshore enterprises controlled by PRC enterprises or PRC enterprise groups, not those controlled
	by PRC individuals or foreigners like us, the criteria set forth in the circular may reflect the State Administration of Taxation&rsquo;s
	general position on how the &ldquo;de facto management body&rdquo; test should be applied in determining the tax resident status
	of all offshore enterprises. According to Circular 82, an offshore incorporated enterprise controlled by a PRC enterprise or a
	PRC enterprise group will be regarded as a PRC tax resident by virtue of having its &ldquo;de facto management body&rdquo; in
	China and will be subject to PRC enterprise income tax on its global income only if all of the following conditions are met: (i)&nbsp;the
	primary location of the day-to-day operational management is in the PRC; (ii)&nbsp;decisions relating to the enterprise&rsquo;s
	financial and human resource matters are made or are subject to approval by organizations or personnel in the PRC; (iii)&nbsp;the
	enterprise&rsquo;s primary assets, accounting books and records, company seals, and board and shareholder resolutions, are located
	or maintained in the PRC; and (iv)&nbsp;at least 50% of voting board members or senior executives habitually reside in the PRC.

	We believe none of our entities outside of China is a PRC resident
	enterprise for PRC tax purposes. See &ldquo;Item 10. Additional Information&mdash;E. Taxation&mdash;People&rsquo;s Republic of
	China Taxation.&rdquo; However, the tax resident status of an enterprise is subject to determination by the PRC tax authorities
	and uncertainties remain with respect to the interpretation of the term &ldquo;de facto management body.&rdquo; As substantially
	all of our management members are based in China, it remains unclear how the tax residency rule will apply to our case. If the
	PRC tax authorities determine that Yirendai Ltd. or any of our subsidiaries outside of China is a PRC resident enterprise for
	PRC enterprise income tax purposes, then Yirendai Ltd. or such subsidiary could be subject to PRC tax at a rate of 25% on its
	world-wide income, which could materially reduce our net income. In addition, we will also be subject to PRC enterprise income
	tax reporting obligations. Furthermore, if the PRC tax authorities determine that we are a PRC resident enterprise for enterprise
	income tax purposes, gains realized on the sale or other disposition of our ADSs or ordinary shares may be subject to PRC tax,
	at a rate of 10% in the case of non-PRC enterprises or 20% in the case of non-PRC individuals (in each case, subject to the provisions
	of any applicable tax treaty), if such gains are deemed to be from PRC sources. It is unclear whether non-PRC shareholders of
	our company would be able to claim the benefits of any tax treaties between their country of tax residence and the PRC in the
	event that we are treated as a PRC resident enterprise. Any such tax may reduce the returns on the investment in our ADSs.

	We are a holding company incorporated under the laws of the
	Cayman Islands and as such rely on dividends and other distributions on equity from our PRC subsidiary to satisfy part of our
	liquidity requirements. Pursuant to the PRC Enterprise Income Tax Law, a withholding tax rate of 10% currently applies to dividends
	paid by a PRC &ldquo;resident enterprise&rdquo; to a foreign enterprise investor, unless any such foreign investor&rsquo;s jurisdiction
	of incorporation has a tax treaty with China that provides for preferential tax treatment. Pursuant to the Arrangement between
	the Mainland China and the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and Tax Evasion on Income,
	or the Double Tax Avoidance Arrangement, such withholding tax rate may be lowered to 5% if a Hong Kong resident enterprise owns
	no less than 25% of a PRC enterprise. However, the 5% withholding tax rate does not automatically apply and certain requirements
	must be satisfied, including without limitation that (a) the Hong Kong enterprise must be the beneficial owner of the relevant
	dividends; and (b) the Hong Kong enterprise must directly hold no less than 25% share ownership in the PRC enterprise during the
	12 consecutive months preceding its receipt of the dividends. In current practice, a Hong Kong enterprise must obtain a tax resident
	certificate from the Hong Kong tax authority to apply for the 5% lower PRC withholding tax rate. As the Hong Kong tax authority
	will issue such a tax resident certificate on a case-by-case basis, we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain the tax
	resident certificate from the relevant Hong Kong tax authority and enjoy the preferential withholding tax rate of 5% under the

	In February 2015, the SAT issued Circular 7 to replace the
	rules relating to indirect transfers in Circular 698. Circular 7 has introduced a new tax regime that is significantly different
	from that under Circular 698. Circular 7 extends its tax jurisdiction to not only indirect transfers set forth under Circular
	698 but also transactions involving transfer of other taxable assets, through the offshore transfer of a foreign intermediate
	holding company. In addition, Circular 7 provides clearer criteria than Circular 698 on how to assess reasonable commercial purposes
	and has introduced safe harbors for internal group restructurings and the purchase and sale of equity through a public securities
	market. Circular 7 also brings challenges to both the foreign transferor and transferee (or other person who is obligated to pay
	for the transfer) of the taxable assets.&nbsp;Where a non-resident enterprise conducts an &ldquo;indirect transfer&rdquo; by transferring
	the taxable assets indirectly by disposing of the equity interests of an overseas holding company, the non-resident enterprise
	being the transferor, or the transferee, or the PRC entity which directly owned the taxable assets may report to the relevant
	tax authority such indirect transfer. Using a &ldquo;substance over form&rdquo; principle, the PRC tax authority may disregard
	the existence of the overseas holding company if it lacks a reasonable commercial purpose and was established for the purpose
	of reducing, avoiding or deferring PRC tax. As a result, gains derived from such indirect transfer may be subject to PRC enterprise
	income tax, and the transferee or other person who is obligated to pay for the transfer is obligated to withhold the applicable
	taxes, currently at a rate of 10% for the transfer of equity interests in a PRC resident enterprise.

	and directed that under Chinese law they could not respond directly to the U.S. regulators on those requests, and that requests

	firms, including our independent registered public accounting firm. In January 2014, the administrative law judge reached an initial
	decision to impose penalties on the firms including a temporary suspension of their right to practice before the SEC. The accounting
	firms filed a petition for review of the initial decision. On February 6, 2015, before a review by the commissioners of the SEC
	had taken place, the firms reached a settlement with the SEC. Under the settlement, the SEC accepts that future requests by the
	SEC for the production of documents will normally be made to the CSRC. The firms will receive matching Section 106 requests, and
	are required to abide by a detailed set of procedures with respect to such requests, which in substance require them to facilitate
	production via the CSRC. If they fail to meet specified criteria, the SEC retains authority to impose a variety of additional
	remedial measures on the firms depending on the nature of the failure. Remedies for any future noncompliance could include, as
	appropriate, an automatic six-month bar on a single firm&rsquo;s performance of certain audit work, commencement of a new proceeding

	We expect these rules and regulations to increase our legal

	ensuring compliance with the requirements of Section&nbsp;404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the other rules and regulations

	higher costs to obtain the same or similar coverage. In addition, we will incur additional costs associated with our public company

	of the transaction life cycle are handled by us, with our online marketplace facilitating the loan transaction, from application
	to credit decisioning to matching and servicing. Our referral arrangement with CreditEase is designed so that CreditEase does
	not compete with our online consumer finance marketplace business. In 2013, 2014 and 2015, 54.2%, 48.1% and 49.5% of our borrowers
	were acquired through referrals from CreditEase, respectively. The average size of loans sourced through offline channels tends
	to be larger than that of loans sourced through online channels.

	investor agrees to invest a specified amount of money to borrowers through our marketplace for a specified period of time. Once
	an investor commits funds using the tool, his funds are automatically allocated among approved borrowers. Our automated investing
	tool automatically reinvests investors&rsquo; funds as soon as a loan is repaid, enabling investors to speed the reinvestment
	of cash flows without having to continually revisit our website or mobile application. Unless an emergency withdrawal fee is paid,
	investors using our automated investing tool are not allowed to withdraw their funds prior to the expiration of the specified
	investment period, which does not necessarily match the term of the loans to which the automated investing tool allocates the
	investor&rsquo;s funds. In 2014 and 2015, the vast majority of funds invested by investors through our marketplace were invested
	utilizing this automated investing tool.

	In order to encourage investors to diversify their risks, we have a policy capping each investor&rsquo;s investment in a given

	In January 2015 we launched our new risk reserve fund. Under
	the current arrangement, we set aside a certain amount of cash in an interest-bearing custody account. The risk reserve fund covers
	loans originated on or after January&nbsp;1, 2015. If a loan originated on or after January 1, 2015 defaults, we will withdraw
	funds from the risk reserve fund to repay the principal and accrued interest for the defaulted loan, unless the risk reserve fund
	is depleted. At the inception of each loan, we set aside cash in an amount equal to a certain percentage of the loan amount facilitated
	on our platform. We reserve the right to revise this percentage upwards or downwards from time to time. In addition, we monitor
	the balance of the risk reserve fund on a monthly basis, and adjust on a quarterly basis by putting an appropriate additional
	amount of cash from other sources into the risk reserve fund as needed to ensure we can sufficiently cover the expected payouts.

	the difference between the interest rates on the underlying loans which range from 10.0% and 12.5%, and the targeted returns offered
	to investors which range from 6.6% to 10.2%. The monthly management fee for using the self-directed investing tool is equal to
	10% of the interest that investors receive, which ranges from 10.0% to 12.5%. A one-time fee is charged to all investors for each
	loan transferred over our secondary loan market.

	Our borrower application process begins with the submission
	of a loan application by a prospective borrower. Borrowers can apply through our website or mobile applications. For borrowers
	acquired through CreditEase&rsquo;s on-the-ground sales network, a CreditEase salesperson will guide the prospective borrower
	in completing the application process and input the application and required information into our system. As part of both the
	online and offline application process, the prospective borrower is asked to provide various personal details. The specific personal
	details required will depend upon the borrower&rsquo;s desired loan product, but typically include PRC identity card information,
	employer information, bank account information, credit card information and a credit report from the PBOC. For our FastTrack product,
	applicants may complete an application on our platform in three steps taking as little as ten minutes, significantly reducing
	the time normally spent applying for a loan.

	Following initial qualification, we commence a credit review
	utilizing our proprietary credit scoring model to generate an Yirendai score for the prospective borrower that drives the decision
	whether to extend credit. Our current proprietary credit-scoring model originates from a credit scoring system that was developed
	by CreditEase in conjunction with Fair Issac Corporation, or FICO, a leading U.S. provider of analytics software and tools used
	to manage risk and fight fraud. We have further modified our credit scoring system to adapt it to the realities of the Chinese
	market, which has historically had no source of widely available consumer credit information. Today, our credit scoring system
	uses our own scoring criteria, and is routinely monitored, tested, updated and validated by our risk management team. Following
	the generation of the Yirendai score, our credit decisioning system makes a determination as to whether the prospective borrower
	is qualified. Unqualified borrowers are notified of the decision to decline their applications for failing to meet minimum requirements.

	For a potential borrower who meets our minimum requirements
	and is applying for our standard loan products, the application proceeds to our credit assessment team for review. A member of
	our credit assessment team will first conduct a telephone verification interview with the applicant. After the initial telephone
	verification interview, one junior and one senior member of our credit assessment team will analyze the application and Yirendai
	score. If a member of the credit assessment team suspects there may be fraud involved with a particular loan application or determines
	that additional verification is needed to complete the credit decisioning process, that team member will conduct further due diligence
	and verification, such as additional phone calls to the borrower applicant and the applicant&rsquo;s employer that is identified
	in the application. While these additional steps have led us to discover instances of invalid information provided by prospective
	borrowers in the past, the number of such instances has not been significant. Following this review, the credit assessment team
	will either approve the loan as is, approve the loan with one or more modified sets of loan characteristics, or decline the loan
	application. In 2014 and 2015, 18.8% and 25.7% of all loan applications were approved, respectively.

	Once the loan application is approved, we make a loan agreement

	process is divided into distinct stages based on the severity of delinquency, which dictates the level of collection steps taken.
	For example, reminder text messages and emails are sent to a delinquent borrower as soon as the collections process commences,
	and if the payment is still outstanding, the collection team will make phone calls, then followed by visits to the delinquent
	borrower&rsquo;s home. Although all stages of the collections process are outsourced to CreditEase, we handle all decisions to
	restructure or defer delinquent loans that are above a certain threshold, while CreditEase collection teams have the discretion
	to make decisions for the loans that are below such threshold.

	Prior to August 2013, we offered investors an investor protection
	service in the form of a risk reserve fund, whereby we set aside a portion of the service fees we received in the risk reserve
	fund. In the event that a loan defaults for more than fifteen days, we will use cash from the risk reserve fund to pay the loan
	principal and accrued interest to the investor. According to our agreements with investors, our contractual obligation for repayment
	of defaulted loans is limited to the amount of cash we set aside in the risk reserve fund. We charged investors a risk reserve
	management fee at a rate of 10% of the loan interest for this service.

	In August 2013, we replaced the previous risk reserve fund
	with a guarantee system. Under this system, we worked with Tian Da Xin An, a guarantee company, to provide investors with the
	option of purchasing the assurance that their principal and interest would be repaid in the event that their loans defaulted,
	and the guarantee company charged investors 10% of the loan interest for the guarantee service. Historically, more than 99% of
	investors opted into the guarantee system. When we switched to the guarantee model in August 2013, we paid Tian Da Xin An a one-time
	fee of US$0.3 million for its assumption of the outstanding loan balances covered under our previous risk reserve fund.

	Starting on January 1, 2015, we ended our relationship with
	the guarantee company, which will still continue to guarantee all previously guaranteed loans, and launched our new risk reserve
	fund. This new risk reserve fund covers loans originated on or after January 1, 2015. Under this arrangement, at the inception
	of each loan we set aside cash in an amount equal to a certain percentage of the loan amount facilitated on our platform in an
	interest-bearing custody account managed by China Guangfa Bank. We reserve the right to revise this percentage upwards or downwards
	from time to time. The factors that we consider in determining such percentage include market dynamics, our product lines, profitability,
	cash position and our actual and expected risk reserve payouts.

<P STYLE="FONT: 10PT TIMES NEW ROMAN, TIMES, SERIF; MARGIN: 0PT 0">
	Under the risk reserve fund arrangement, if a borrower is 15
	days delinquent in repaying an installment of principal and interest of a loan, we will withdraw an amount from the custody account
	to repay the delinquent installment of principal and interest to the corresponding investor. If a borrower is 90 days delinquent
	in repaying an installment of principal and interest on a loan, we will withdraw an amount from the custody account to repay the
	delinquent installment principal and interest, plus the entire outstanding balance of the loan principal, to the corresponding
	investor. If the risk reserve fund becomes insufficient to pay back all the investors with delinquent loans, these investors will
	be repaid on a pro rata basis, and their outstanding unpaid balances will be deferred to the next time the risk reserve fund is
	replenished, at which time a distribution will again be made to all investors with delinquent loans. Following replenishment of
	the risk reserve fund, in the event that the amount of funds is again insufficient to pay back all investors with delinquent loans,
	the investors will again be repaid on a pro rata basis, although in this case the number of investors sharing pro rata in the
	risk reserve fund will increase to include the unpaid investors from prior periods as well as the unpaid investors from the current
	period. If the risk reserve fund is continually underfunded, investors may need to wait for extended periods to receive a full
	distribution from the risk reserve fund, or incur a loss on their investment if the risk reserve fund is not sufficient. Starting
	in November 2015, we placed a two-year limit on the period during which an investor has the right to receive distribution from
	the risk reserve fund, which means if an investor has not recovered the full default amount by the time that is two years and
	90 days from the original due date, then the investor will no longer have the right to receive pro rata repayment from our risk
	reserve fund. As a result, investors will bear the risk that they will not be able to fully recover their investment principal
	and unpaid interest.

	Once we make a payment to an investor, we seek to collect the
	amounts from the borrower through the collection process. The amount collected from the borrower, if any, is remitted to first
	replenish the portion of the risk reserve fund used to repay the investor, and if there is any additional amount remaining, then
	to reimburse our collection expenses. If we are not successful in collecting a sufficient amount from the default borrower to
	cover our collection expenses, our risk reserve fund service agreement with investors calls for investors to reimburse us for
	any litigation or arbitration expenses we may have advanced on their behalf during the collections process, although in practice
	we will bear the unrecovered portion of these and all other collection expenses.

	proposed Foreign Investment Law for public review and comments. The draft law purports to change the existing &ldquo;case-by-case&rdquo;
	approval regime to a &ldquo;filing or approval&rdquo; procedure for foreign investments in China. The State Council will determine
	a list of industry categories that are subject to special administrative measures, which is referred to as a &ldquo;negative list,&rdquo;
	consisting of a list of industry categories where foreign investments are strictly prohibited, or the &ldquo;prohibited list&rdquo;
	and a list of industry categories where foreign investments are subject to certain restrictions, or the &ldquo;restricted list.&rdquo;
	Foreign investments in business sectors outside of the &ldquo;negative list&rdquo; will only be subject to a filing procedure,
	in contrast to the existing prior approval requirements, whereas foreign investments in any industry categories that are on the
	&ldquo;restricted list&rdquo; must apply for approval from the foreign investment administration authority.

	The draft for the first time defines a foreign investor not
	only based on where it is incorporated or organized, but also by using the standard of &ldquo;actual control.&rdquo; The draft
	specifically provides that entities established in China, but &ldquo;controlled&rdquo; by foreign investors will be treated as
	FIEs. Once an entity is considered to be an FIE, it may be subject to the foreign investment restrictions in the &ldquo;restricted
	list&rdquo; or prohibitions set forth in the &ldquo;prohibited list.&rdquo; If an FIE proposes to conduct business in an industry
	subject to foreign investment restrictions in the &ldquo;restricted list,&rdquo; the FIE must go through a market entry clearance
	by the MOC before being established. If an FIE proposes to conduct business in an industry subject to foreign investment prohibitions
	in the &ldquo;prohibited list,&rdquo; it must not engage in the business. However, an FIE that conducts business in an industry
	that is in the &ldquo;restricted list,&rdquo; upon market entry clearance, may apply in writing for being treated as a PRC domestic
	investment if it is ultimately &ldquo;controlled&rdquo; by PRC government authorities and its affiliates and/or PRC citizens.
	In this connection, &ldquo;control&rdquo; is broadly defined in the draft law to cover the following summarized categories: (i)&nbsp;holding
	50% or more of the voting rights of the subject entity; (ii)&nbsp;holding less than 50% of the voting rights of the subject entity
	but having the power to secure at least 50% of the seats on the board or other equivalent decision making bodies, or having the
	voting power to exert material influence on the board, the shareholders&rsquo; meeting or other equivalent decision making bodies;
	or (iii)&nbsp;having the power to exert decisive influence, via contractual or trust arrangements, over the subject entity&rsquo;s

	The draft emphasizes on the security review requirements, whereby
	all foreign investments that jeopardize or may jeopardize national security must be reviewed and approved in accordance with the
	security review procedure. In addition, the draft imposes stringent ad hoc and periodic information reporting requirements on
	foreign investors and the applicable FIEs. Aside from investment implementation report and investment amendment report that are
	required at each investment and alteration of investment specifics, an annual report is mandatory, and large foreign investors
	meeting certain criteria are required to report on a quarterly basis. Any company found to be non-compliant with these information
	reporting obligations may potentially be subject to fines and/or administrative or criminal liabilities, and the persons directly
	responsible may be subject to criminal liabilities.

	The PRC Contract Law governs the formation, validity, performance,
	enforcement and assignment of contracts. The PRC Contract Law confirms the validity of loan agreement between individuals and
	provides that the loan agreement becomes effective when the individual lender provides the loan to the individual borrower. The
	PRC Contract Law requires that the interest rates charged under the loan agreement must not violate the applicable provisions
	of the PRC laws and regulations. In accordance with the Provisions on Several Issues Concerning Laws Applicable to Trials of Private
	Lending Cases issued by the Supreme People&rsquo;s Court on August 6, 2015, or the Private Lending Judicial Interpretations, which
	came into effect on September 1, 2015, private lending is defined as financing between individuals, legal entities and other organizations.
	When private loans between individuals are paid by wire transfer, through online peer-to-peer lending platforms or by other similar
	means, the loan contracts between individuals are deemed to be validated upon the deposit of funds to the borrower&rsquo;s account.
	In the event that the loans are made through an online peer-to-peer lending platform and the platform only provides intermediary
	services, the courts shall dismiss the claims of the parties concerned against the platform demanding the repayment of loans by
	the platform as guarantors. However, if the online peer-to-peer lending service provider guarantees repayment of the loans as
	evidenced by its web page, advertisements or other media, or the court is provided with other proof, the lender&rsquo;s claim
	alleging that the peer-to-peer lending service provider shall assume the obligations of a guarantor will be upheld by the courts.
	The Private Lending Judicial Interpretations also provide that agreements between the lender and borrower on loans with interest
	rates below 24% per annum are valid and enforceable. As to loans with interest rates per annum between 24% and 36%, if the interest
	on the loans has already been paid to the lender, and so long as such payment has not damaged the interest of the state, the community
	and any third parties, the courts will turn down the borrower&rsquo;s request to demand the return of the interest payment. If
	the annual interest rate of a private loan is higher than 36%, the excess will not be enforced by the courts. All the loan transactions
	facilitated over our marketplace are between individuals currently. The APRs for the term loans on our marketplace currently range
	from 16.9% to 39.5%, which comprises a fixed interest rate and a transaction fee rate we charge borrowers for our services. See
	&ldquo;&mdash;Our Products and Services&mdash;Loan Pricing Mechanism.&rdquo; The interest rate component, which is stipulated
	in the loan agreements, does not and is not expected to exceed the mandatory limit for loan interest rates.

	Applications of Laws for Trial of Criminal Cases on Illegal Fund-Raising, or the Illegal Fund-Raising Judicial Interpretations,
	which came into force in January 2011. The Illegal Fund-Raising Judicial Interpretations provide that a public fund-raising will
	constitute a criminal offense related to &ldquo;illegally soliciting deposits from the public&rdquo; under the PRC Criminal Law,
	if it meets all the following four criteria: (i)&nbsp;the fund-raising has not been approved by the relevant authorities or is
	concealed under the guise of legitimate acts; (ii)&nbsp;the fund-raising employs general solicitation or advertising such as social
	media, promotion meetings, leafleting and SMS advertising; (iii)&nbsp;the fundraiser promises to repay, after a specified period
	of time, the capital and interests, or investment returns in cash, properties in kind and other forms; and (iv)&nbsp;the fund-raising
	targets at the general public as opposed to specific individuals. An illegal fund-raising activity will be fined or prosecuted
	in the event that it constitutes a criminal offense. Pursuant to the Illegal Fund-Raising Judicial Interpretations, an offender
	that is an entity will be subject to criminal liabilities, if it illegally solicits deposits from the general public or illegally
	solicits deposits in disguised form (i)&nbsp;with the amount of deposits involved exceeding RMB1,000,000 (US$154,373), (ii)&nbsp;with
	over 150 fund-raising targets involved, or (iii)&nbsp;with the direct economic loss caused to fund-raising targets exceeding RMB500,000
	(US$77,187), or (iv)&nbsp;the illegal fund-raising activities have caused baneful influences to the public or have led to other
	severe consequences. An individual offender is also subject to criminal liabilities but with lower thresholds. In addition, an
	individual or an entity who has aided in illegal fund-raising from the general public and charges fees including but not limited
	to agent fees, rewards, rebates and commission, constitute an accomplice of the crime of illegal fund-raising. In accordance with
	the Opinions of the Supreme People&rsquo;s Court, the Supreme People&rsquo;s Procurator and the Ministry of Public Security on
	Several Issues concerning the Application of Law in the Illegal Fund-Raising Criminal Cases, the administrative proceeding for
	determining the nature of illegal fund-raising activities is not a prerequisite procedure for the initiation of criminal proceeding
	concerning the crime of illegal fund-raising, and the administrative departments&rsquo; failure in determining the nature of illegal
	fund-raising activities does not affect the investigation, prosecution and trial of cases concerning the crime of illegal fund-raising.

	In recent years, PRC government authorities have enacted laws
	and regulations on internet use to protect personal information from any unauthorized disclosure. Under the Several Provisions
	on Regulating the Market Order of Internet Information Services, issued by the MIIT in December 2011, an ICP service operator
	may not collect any user personal information or provide any such information to third parties without the consent of a user.
	An ICP service operator must expressly inform the users of the method, content and purpose of the collection and processing of
	such user personal information and may only collect such information necessary for the provision of its services. An ICP service
	operator is also required to properly maintain the user personal information, and in case of any leak or likely leak of the user
	personal information, the ICP service operator must take immediate remedial measures and, in severe circumstances, make an immediate
	report to the telecommunications regulatory authority. In addition, pursuant to the Decision on Strengthening the Protection of
	Online Information issued by the Standing Committee of the National People&rsquo;s Congress in December 2012 and the Order for
	the Protection of Telecommunication and Internet User Personal Information issued by the MIIT in July 2013, any collection and
	use of user personal information must be subject to the consent of the user, abide by the principles of legality, rationality
	and necessity and be within the specified purposes, methods and scopes. An ICP service operator must also keep such information
	strictly confidential, and is further prohibited from divulging, tampering or destroying of any such information, or selling or
	providing such information to other parties. An ICP service operator is required to take technical and other measures to prevent
	the collected personal information from any unauthorized disclosure, damage or loss. Any violation of these laws and regulations
	may subject the ICP service operator to warnings, fines, confiscation of illegal gains, revocation of licenses, cancellation of
	filings, closedown of websites or even criminal liabilities. The Guidelines jointly released by ten PRC regulatory agencies in
	July 2015 also prohibit internet finance service providers, including online peer-to-peer lending platforms, from illegally selling
	or disclosing customers&rsquo; personal information. The PBOC and other relevant regulatory authorities will jointly adopt the
	implementing rules. Pursuant to the Ninth Amendment to the Criminal Law issued by the Standing Committee of the National People&rsquo;s
	Congress in August 2015 and becoming effective in November, 2015, any internet service provider that fails to fulfill the obligations
	related to internet information security administration as required by applicable laws and refuses to rectify upon orders, shall
	be subject to criminal penalty for the result of (i) any dissemination of illegal information in large scale; (ii) any severe
	effect due to the leakage of the client&rsquo;s information; (iii) any serious loss of criminal evidence; or (iv) other severe
	situation, and any individual or entity that (i) sells or provides personal information to others in a way violating the applicable
	law, or (ii) steals or illegally obtain any personal information, shall be subject to criminal penalty in severe situation.

	the PRC, and grants a term of ten years to registered trademarks and another ten years if requested upon expiry of the initial
	or extended term. Trademark license agreements must be filed with the Trademark Office for record. As of the date of this annual

	are pending with the Trademark Office under the State Administration for Industry and Commerce. We have obtained a worldwide,

	Pursuant to the Enterprise Income Tax Law and its implementation
	rules, if a non-resident enterprise has not set up an organization or establishment in the PRC, or has set up an organization
	or establishment but the income derived has no actual connection with such organization or establishment, it will be subject to
	a withholding tax on its PRC-sourced income at a rate of 10%. Pursuant to the Arrangement between Mainland China and the Hong&nbsp;Kong
	Special Administrative Region for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and Tax Evasion on Income, the withholding tax rate in respect
	to the payment of dividends by a PRC enterprise to a Hong&nbsp;Kong enterprise is reduced to 5% from a standard rate of 10% if
	the Hong&nbsp;Kong enterprise directly holds at least 25% of the PRC enterprise. Pursuant to the Notice of the State Administration
	of Taxation on the Issues concerning the Application of the Dividend Clauses of Tax Agreements, or Circular 81, a Hong&nbsp;Kong
	resident enterprise must meet the following conditions, among others, in order to enjoy the reduced withholding tax: (i)&nbsp;it
	must directly own the required percentage of equity interests and voting rights in the PRC resident enterprise; and (ii)&nbsp;it
	must have directly owned such percentage in the PRC resident enterprise throughout the 12&nbsp;months prior to receiving the dividends.
	There are also other conditions for enjoying the reduced withholding tax rate according to other relevant tax rules and regulations.
	In August 2015, the State Administration of Taxation promulgated the Administrative Measures for Non-Resident Taxpayers to Enjoy
	Treatments under Tax Treaties, or Circular 60, which became effective on November 1, 2015. Circular 60 provides that non-resident
	enterprises are not required to obtain pre-approval from the relevant tax authority in order to enjoy the reduced withholding
	tax rate. Instead, non-resident enterprises and their withholding agents may, by self-assessment and on confirmation that the
	prescribed criteria to enjoy the tax treaty benefits are met, directly apply the reduced withholding tax rate, and file necessary
	forms and supporting documents when performing tax filings, which will be subject to post-tax filing examinations by the relevant
	tax authorities. Accordingly, Yirendai HK, our Hong Kong subsidiary, may be able to enjoy the 5% withholding tax rate for the
	dividends they receive from Heng Ye, our PRC subsidiary, if it satisfies the conditions prescribed under Circular 81 and other
	relevant tax rules and regulations. However, according to Circular 81 and Circular 60, if the relevant tax authorities consider
	the transactions or arrangements we have are for the primary purpose of enjoying a favorable tax treatment, the relevant tax authorities
	may adjust the favorable withholding tax in the future.

	In November 2012, SAFE promulgated the Circular of Further
	Improving and Adjusting Foreign Exchange Administration Policies on Foreign Direct Investment, which substantially amends and
	simplifies the current foreign exchange procedure. Pursuant to this circular, the opening of various special purpose foreign exchange

	of RMB proceeds derived by foreign investors in the PRC, and remittance of foreign exchange profits and dividends by a foreign-invested
	enterprise to its foreign shareholders no longer require the approval or verification of SAFE, and multiple capital accounts for
	the same entity may be opened in different provinces, which was not possible previously. In addition, SAFE promulgated another
	circular in May 2013, which specifies that the administration by SAFE or its local branches over direct investment by foreign
	investors in the PRC must be conducted by way of registration and banks must process foreign exchange business relating to the
	direct investment in the PRC based on the registration information provided by SAFE and its branches. On February 28, 2015, SAFE
	promulgated the Notice on Further Simplifying and Improving the Administration of the Foreign Exchange Concerning Direct Investment,
	or SAFE Notice 13. After SAFE Notice 13 became effective on June 1, 2015, instead of applying for approvals regarding foreign
	exchange registrations of foreign direct investment and overseas direct investment from SAFE, entities and individuals may apply
	for such foreign exchange registrations from qualified banks. The qualified banks, under the supervision of SAFE, may directly
	review the applications and conduct the registration.

	On March 30, 2015, SAFE promulgated Circular 19, which expands
	a pilot reform of the administration of the settlement of the foreign exchange capitals of foreign-invested enterprises nationwide.
	Circular 19 came into force and replaced both previous Circular 142 and Circular 36 on June 1, 2015. Circular 19 allows all foreign-invested
	enterprises established in the PRC to use their foreign exchange capitals to make equity investment and removes certain other
	restrictions provided in Circular 142. However, Circular 19 continues to, prohibit foreign-invested enterprises from, among other
	things, using RMB fund converted from its foreign exchange capitals for expenditure beyond its business scope and providing entrusted
	loans or repaying loans between non-financial enterprises. Circular 19 may delay or limit us from using the proceeds of offshore

	SAFE issued SAFE Circular on Relevant Issues Relating to Domestic
	Resident&rsquo;s Investment and Financing and Roundtrip Investment through Special Purpose Vehicles, or SAFE Circular 37, that
	became effective in July&nbsp;2014, replacing the previous SAFE Circular 75. SAFE Circular 37 regulates foreign exchange matters
	in relation to the use of special purpose vehicles, or SPVs, by PRC residents or entities to seek offshore investment and financing
	or conduct round trip investment in China. Under SAFE Circular 37, a SPV refers to an offshore entity established or controlled,
	directly or indirectly, by PRC residents or entities for the purpose of seeking offshore financing or making offshore investment,
	using legitimate onshore or offshore assets or interests, while &ldquo;round trip investment&rdquo; refers to direct investment
	in China by PRC residents or entities through SPVs, namely, establishing foreign-invested enterprises to obtain the ownership,
	control rights and management rights. SAFE Circular 37 provides that, before making contribution into an SPV, PRC residents or
	entities are required to complete foreign exchange registration with SAFE or its local branch. SAFE promulgated the Notice on
	Further Simplifying and Improving the Administration of the Foreign Exchange Concerning Direct Investment in February 2015, which
	took effect on June 1, 2015. This notice has amended SAFE Circular 37 requiring PRC residents or entities to register with qualified
	banks rather than SAFE or its local branch in connection with their establishment or control of an offshore entity established
	for the purpose of overseas investment or financing.

	PRC residents or entities who had contributed legitimate onshore
	or offshore interests or assets to SPVs but had not obtained registration as required before the implementation of the SAFE Circular
	37 must register their ownership interests or control in the SPVs with qualified banks. An amendment to the registration is required
	if there is a material change with respect to the SPV registered, such as any change of basic information (including change of
	the PRC residents, name and operation term), increases or decreases in investment amount, transfers or exchanges of shares, and
	mergers or divisions. Failure to comply with the registration procedures set forth in SAFE Circular 37 and the subsequent notice,
	or making misrepresentation on or failure to disclose controllers of the foreign-invested enterprise that is established through
	round-trip investment, may result in restrictions being imposed on the foreign exchange activities of the relevant foreign-invested
	enterprise, including payment of dividends and other distributions, such as proceeds from any reduction in capital, share transfer
	or liquidation, to its offshore parent or affiliate, and the capital inflow from the offshore parent, and may also subject relevant

	must, on behalf of the PRC residents who have the right to exercise the employee share options, apply to SAFE or its local branches

	to the shareholders of Heng&nbsp;Cheng solely for the capitalization of Heng Cheng. Pursuant to the loan agreement, the shareholders

	However, there are substantial uncertainties regarding the
	interpretation and application of current and future PRC laws, regulations and rules. In particular, in January 2015, the MOC
	published a discussion draft of the proposed Foreign Investment Law for public review and comments. Among other things, the draft
	Foreign Investment Law expands the definition of foreign investment and introduces the principle of &ldquo;actual control&rdquo;
	in determining whether a company is considered a foreign-invested enterprise, or an FIE. Under the draft Foreign Investment Law,
	variable interest entities would also be deemed as FIEs, if they are ultimately &ldquo;controlled&rdquo; by foreign investors,
	and be subject to restrictions on foreign investments. However, the draft law has not taken a position on what actions will be
	taken with respect to the existing companies with the &ldquo;variable interest entity&rdquo; structure, whether or not these companies
	are controlled by Chinese parties. It is uncertain when the draft may be signed into law, if at all, and whether any final version
	would have substantial changes from the draft. Accordingly, the PRC regulatory authorities may in the future take a view that
	is contrary to the above opinion of our PRC counsel. If the PRC government finds that the agreements that establish the structure
	for operating our online consumer finance marketplace business do not comply with PRC government restrictions on foreign investment
	in value-added telecommunications services businesses, such as internet content provision services, we could be subject to severe
	penalties, including being prohibited from continuing operations. See &ldquo;Item. 3 Key Information&mdash;D. Risk Factors&mdash;Risks
	Related to Our Corporate Structure&mdash;If the PRC government deems that the contractual arrangements in relation to Heng Cheng,
	our consolidated variable interest entity, do not comply with PRC regulatory restrictions on foreign investment in the relevant
	industries, or if these regulations or the interpretation of existing regulations change in the future, we could be subject to
	severe penalties or be forced to relinquish our interests in those operations,&rdquo; &ldquo;Item. 3 Key Information&mdash;D.
	Risk Factors&mdash;Risks Related to Doing Business in China&mdash;We may be adversely affected by the complexity, uncertainties
	and changes in PRC regulation of internet-related businesses and companies, and any lack of requisite approvals, licenses or permits

	Key Information&mdash;D. Risk Factors&mdash;Risks Related to Doing Business in China&mdash;Uncertainties in the interpretation

	We are a leading online consumer finance marketplace in China
	connecting investors and individual borrowers, according to iResearch. We facilitated over RMB12.0 billion (US$1.9 billion) in
	loans from our inception in March 2012 through December 31, 2015. Our online platform automates key aspects of our operations
	and enables us to efficiently match borrowers with investors and facilitate and execute loan transactions. Our borrowers and investors
	come from a variety of channels, including online sources, such as through the internet and our mobile applications, as well as
	offline sources, such as referrals from CreditEase&rsquo;s on-the-ground sales network.

	We currently target prime borrowers, comprising credit card
	holders with stable credit performance and salary income. We strategically focus on prime borrowers as we believe members of this
	group tend to be more creditworthy and more receptive to internet finance solutions. Our online marketplace offers qualified borrowers
	quick and convenient access to credit at competitive prices.

	Our online marketplace provides investors with attractive returns
	with investment thresholds as low as RMB100 (US$15.4). Investors have the option to individually select specific loans to invest
	in or to use our automated investing tool that identifies and selects loans on the basis of a targeted return. We also offer investors
	a risk reserve fund service with the aim of limiting losses to investors from borrower defaults. In addition, we provide investors
	with access to a liquid secondary market, giving them an opportunity to exit their investments before the underlying loans become
	due.

	We generate revenues primarily from fees charged for our services
	in matching investors with individual borrowers and for other services we provide over the life of a loan. We charge borrowers
	transaction fees for services provided through our platform in facilitating loan transactions, and charge investors service fees
	for using our automated investing tool or self-directed investing tool. We currently do not charge separate fees for the risk
	reserve fund service. As an information intermediary, we do not use our own capital to invest in loans facilitated through our
	marketplace.

<P STYLE="FONT: 10PT TIMES NEW ROMAN, TIMES, SERIF; MARGIN: 0PT 0">
	The demand for online consumer finance marketplace services
	from borrowers and investors is dependent upon overall economic conditions in China. General economic factors, including the interest
	rate environment and unemployment rates, may affect borrowers&rsquo; willingness to seek loans and investors&rsquo; ability and
	desire to invest in loans. For example, significant increases in interest rates could cause potential borrowers to defer obtaining
	loans as they wait for interest rates to become stable or decrease. Additionally, a slowdown in the economy, such as from a rise
	in the unemployment rate and a decrease in real income, may affect individuals&rsquo; level of disposable income. This may negatively
	affect borrowers&rsquo; repayment capability, which in turn may decrease their willingness to seek loans and potentially cause
	an increase in default rates. If actual or expected default rates increase generally in China or the consumer finance market,
	investors may delay or reduce their investments in loan products in general, including on our marketplace.

	Our ability to increase the loan volume facilitated through
	our marketplace largely depends on our ability to attract potential borrowers and investors through sales and marketing efforts.
	Our sales and marketing efforts include those related to borrower and investor acquisition and retention, and general marketing.

	effectiveness of these efforts, in particular with regard to borrower and investor acquisition.

	We utilize online channels and offline channels, such as CreditEase&rsquo;s
	on-the-ground sales network, for borrower acquisition. We attract a fast growing number of our borrowers through various online
	channels. In addition, CreditEase&rsquo;s on-the-ground sales network refers borrowers who fall within our target borrower group
	to our online marketplace. CreditEase charges us a fee for offline borrower acquisition services. For the three years starting
	2016, the fee rate will be 6% of the loans facilitated to borrowers referred by CreditEase. After that, the fee rate may be adjusted
	on a yearly basis based on commercial negotiation, and after taking into consideration the costs to CreditEase for providing such
	services and with reference to market rates. Currently, referrals from CreditEase&rsquo;s on-the-ground sales network account
	for a majority of our borrowers and loan volume. In 2013, 2014 and 2015, 54.2%, 48.1% and 49.5 % of our borrowers were acquired
	through referrals from CreditEase, respectively, contributing 61.9%, 59.8% and 67.0% of the total amount of loans facilitated
	through our marketplace, respectively. As we acquire more borrowers, the volume of loans facilitated over our marketplace is expected
	to continue to increase.

	Furthermore, our fee collection schedules from borrowers differ
	depending on the channels in which the borrowers are acquired. Borrowers acquired from online channels typically only pay a portion
	of the transaction fee upfront, with the remainder on a monthly basis over the term of the loan while transaction fees are collected
	upfront from borrowers acquired through offline channels. As a result, for each pricing grade, the overall fee for the lifetime
	of a loan charged to a borrower acquired from online channels is generally higher than that charged to a borrower acquired from
	offline channels. Given revenues are currently recognized at the time when the transaction fees are collected, the combination
	of loans facilitated by channel during a specific period may have an impact on our revenues and results of operations.

	Our ability to effectively segment borrowers into appropriate

	returns, both of which directly relate to the level of user confidence in our marketplace. Our proprietary risk management system
	is built upon data accumulated through our operations, and is further supported by an extensive database accumulated by CreditEase
	over the past nine years. Our risk management model utilizes big data capabilities to automatically evaluate a borrower&rsquo;s
	credit characteristics. At the same time, we use automated verification and fraud detection tools to ensure the quality of the
	loans facilitated on our marketplace, and supplement these technology driven tools with manual processes when necessary. Furthermore,
	our ability to effectively evaluate a borrower&rsquo;s risk profile and likelihood of default may directly affect our results
	of operations. For some of the loans facilitated through our marketplace, borrowers pay us a certain portion of the transaction
	fees upfront upon the completion of our loan facilitation services and the rest on a monthly basis over the term of the applicable
	loan. If a borrower defaults, we may not be able to collect the outstanding transaction fees from the borrower.

	Additionally, we started offering risk reserve fund services
	from January 1, 2015 and revised our risk reserve funding policy in the fourth quarter of 2015. The funding and operation of risk
	reserve fund may have a material impact on our financial conditions. Going forward, based on our current business intention but
	not legal obligation, we intend to set aside sufficient cash in the risk reserve fund to cover the expected payouts, and to continue
	this practice for the foreseeable future. A significant increase in our expected risk reserve payouts will have a negative impact
	on our net revenues and net income. Our ability to assess the expected risk reserve payouts depends on our ability to manage and
	forecast the performance, or the charge-off rates, of the loans facilitated through our marketplace. Since we commenced our online
	consumer finance business only in March 2012, we have limited information regarding the charge-off rates on the loans generated
	through online channels. If the actual payouts turn out to be higher than expected, we may choose to set aside additional cash
	in our risk reserve fund or have to recognize additional expenses and liabilities on our financial statements. This could result
	in constraints to our working capital, or have a material and adverse impact on our financial conditions, results of operations
	and business operations.

	Our ability to maintain profitability largely depends on our
	ability to continually optimize our product mix and to accurately price the loans facilitated through our platform. As part of
	our efforts to introduce risk-based pricing, we have developed four different segments in our current pricing grid, which we refer
	to as Grade A, Grade B, Grade C and Grade D loans in this annual report. Among the four segments, Grade A represents the lowest
	risks associated with the borrowers, while Grade D represents the highest risks. Because of the different level of efforts required
	to facilitate Grade A, B, C and D loans, the transaction fee rate that we charge borrowers varies depending on the pricing grade
	of the loan facilitated. Among the four pricing grades, Grade A loans have the lowest average transaction fee rate of 5.6%, while
	Grade D loans have the highest average transaction fee rate of 28.2%. In response to market competition or further developments,
	we may spend more effort promoting certain loan products, manage the growth in volume of other loan products, introduce new products
	with new pricing grades or adjust the pricing of our existing products. In addition, as we offer investor protection service in
	the form of a risk reserve fund to cover potential defaults, the product mix also has a significant impact on our liabilities
	from risk reserve fund, given the different levels of default risk associated with the different pricing grades. Any material
	change in the product mix could have a significant impact on our profitability and net income margin.

	finance marketplaces, we also compete with other types of financial products and companies that attract borrowers, investors or

	units in commercial banks, credit card issuers and other consumer finance companies. With respect to investors, we primarily compete
	with other investment products and asset classes, such as equities, bonds, investment trust products, bank savings accounts, real
	estate and alternative asset classes. If we are unable to compete effectively, the demand for our marketplace could stagnate or

	We also track the time it takes to recover the payouts made
	from the risk reserve fund. As our collection efforts continue throughout and beyond the term of loans and our historical recovery
	data is limited due to the relatively small number of defaults during our limited operating history, we currently estimate based
	on the historical recovery data of the loans originated by CreditEase that are similar to loans facilitated on our platform that
	the average recovery time for the default loans is about ten months. This estimate of recovery time is calculated based on the
	amount weighted average of the recovery time of defaulted loans from certain vintages, which we consider to have sufficient collection
	performance history (currently defined as two and half years after the loan has defaulted).

	We define M3+ Net Charge Off Rate, with respect to loans facilitated
	during a specified time period, which we refer to as a vintage, as the difference between (i) the total balance of outstanding
	principal of loans that become over three months delinquent during a specified period and the remainder of the expected interest
	for the life of such loans, and (ii) the total amount of recovered past due payments of principal and accrued interest in the
	same period with respect to all loans in the same vintage that have ever become over three months delinquent, divided by (iii)

	The data from CreditEase used to generate the chart above only

	of loans facilitated through our platform. However, the demographics of the borrowers included in the chart above do not entirely
	reflect our current target prime borrowers. In addition, loans facilitated through our platform are priced differently from loans
	priced through CreditEase, and there may be other differences between the data above and the loans facilitated through our platform.

	the M3+ Net Charge-Off Rates, and (ii) our collection efforts continue and may succeed in collecting some past due amount after

	the fourth quarter of 2014 and Grade C loans in the first quarter of 2015. The introduction of these new pricing grades is part

	The transaction fee rate is calculated as the total transaction

	In terms of cash collection, borrowers pay the transaction
	fees primarily on a monthly basis over the term of the loan for loans originated in 2013 and through the nine months ended September
	30, 2014. In the fourth quarter of 2014, we adopted a new fee collection schedule whereby we either collect the entire amount
	of the transaction fee from borrowers upfront upon completion of our loan origination services, or collect a portion of the transaction
	fee upfront and the rest on a monthly basis over the term of the loan. We made this change to improve our cash flow position prior
	to our carve-out from CreditEase in anticipation of the fact that we would no longer be able to rely on CreditEase for our corporate
	cash management and to ensure that we would receive sufficient cash upfront to set aside funds for our new risk reserve fund.
	The fee collection schedule is impacted by the channels through which borrowers are acquired. Under this new system, we collect
	all transaction fees upfront from borrowers acquired through referrals by CreditEase&rsquo;s on-the-ground sales network, which
	is similar to CreditEase&rsquo;s current business practice and also help to provide the cash flows required for our business operations.
	Borrowers acquired from online channels typically pay only a portion, up to 42%, of the transaction fee upfront and the remainder
	on a monthly basis over the term of the loan, with the upfront portion being an amount sufficient to provide cash for the risk
	reserve fund.

	Service fees

	. Service fees mainly include the monthly
	management fee charged to investors for using the automated investing tool and the self-directed investing tool. The monthly management
	fee for using the automated investing tool is the difference between the interest rates on the underlying loans which range from
	10.0% and 12.5%, and the targeted returns offered to investors which range from 6.6% to 10.2%. The monthly management fee for
	using the self-directed investing tool is equal to 10% of the interest that investors receive, which ranges from 10.0% to 12.5%.
	The service fees charged to investors for the automated investing tool or self-directed investing tool are collected on a monthly
	basis through the investment period. We expect that service fees will increase in the foreseeable future, as our business further
	grows and we develop and introduce new services and investing tools to investors.

	Prior to August 2013, we offered investors an investor protection
	service in the form of a risk reserve fund, whereby we set aside a portion of the service fees we received in the risk reserve
	fund. In the event that a loan defaults for more than fifteen days, we will use cash from the risk reserve fund to pay the loan
	principal and accrued interest to the investor. According to our agreements with investors, our contractual obligation for repayment
	of defaulted loans is limited to the amount of cash we set aside in the risk reserve fund. For this service, we charged investors
	a monthly service fee at a rate of 10% of the monthly interest on loans.

<P STYLE="FONT: 10PT TIMES NEW ROMAN, TIMES, SERIF; MARGIN: 0PT 0">
	From August 2013 to December 2014, we replaced the service
	discussed above with a guarantee arrangement to provide investors with the option of purchasing the assurance that their principal
	and interest would be repaid in the event that the loans in which they invested defaulted. Under this arrangement, Tian Da Xin
	An, a guarantee company, was responsible for repaying the principal and accrued interest of the defaulted loan. For this guarantee
	service Tian Da Xin An charged investors at a rate of 10% of the monthly interest on their loans as service fee. Under the relevant
	loan facilitation agreements, we have no obligation to repay any defaulted loans. Instead, we are authorized by investors to require
	Tian Da Xin An to perform its guarantee obligation in case of borrower defaults, and Tian Da Xin An as the guarantor of the corresponding
	borrower shall repay the outstanding principal and interests to the investors, as well as the transaction fees due to our company.
	In practice, we reimbursed the loan principal and accrued interest to the investor in the event of default, and then collected
	that amount from the guarantee company. We collected the guarantee service fee charged to investors by the guarantee company on
	its behalf, and then remitted this amount to the guarantee company. We ceased this guarantee arrangement in December 2014. The
	outstanding loan balance guaranteed under the previous guarantee arrangement will continue to be covered under the guarantee arrangement
	until such loans reach maturity.

	Starting in January 2015, we began offering our new risk reserve
	fund service. For a very brief period during the first quarter of 2015, we charged investors a risk reserve management fee at
	a rate of 10% of the monthly interest rate paid by borrowers for providing this risk reserve fund service on a trial basis, and
	recognized the fee as revenue. Currently, we integrate such fee with other service fees we charge investors and no longer charge
	investors a separate fee for providing risk reserve fund services. We currently do not provide investors with the ability to opt
	out of our risk reserve fund service and we have made participation in the risk reserve fund service compulsory for all new investors
	utilizing our platform. As of December 31, 2015, the total contract amount of loans covered by the risk reserve fund was RMB9,310.2
	million (US$1,437.5 million). See &ldquo;Item 4. Information on the Company&mdash;B. Business Overview&mdash;Risk Management&mdash;Investor
	Protection.&rdquo;

	At the inception of each loan, we recognize a risk reserve
	liability at the fair value of the risk reserve fund service, which is the present value of the expected risk reserve payouts
	incorporating a service markup margin. Our net revenues for a given period will be fees billed net of amount allocated to the
	risk reserve liability and other items. When we make actual payouts from the risk reserve fund in the event of default of loans,
	such payouts are recorded as a reduction of the risk reserve liability. When our contingent liability exceeds our stand-ready
	liability, the difference is recorded as additional risk reserve liability and expensed in our financial statements. As a result,
	a significant increase in our expected risk reserve payouts may have a negative impact on our net income.

	Net revenues
</I>
	. Our net revenues increased from US$31.9
	million in 2014 to US$209.1 million in 2015, primarily due to the substantial increase in the volume of loans facilitated through
	our marketplace, which increased from approximately RMB2,228.6&nbsp;million in 2014 to RMB9,557.6 million (US$1,494.0&nbsp;million)
	in 2015. The increase in the volume of loans facilitated through our marketplace was driven by a substantial increase in the number
	of borrowers from 39,344 in 2014 to 146,390 in 2015. The increase in net revenues was also due to the launch of new loan products
	with higher transaction fee rates in the fourth quarter of 2014 and first quarter of 2015, the monthly management fee that we
	started charging investors using our automated investing tool in the second quarter of 2014, and the monthly management fee that
	we started charging investors using our self-directed investing tool in the first quarter of 2015. For more information about

	We conduct our online consumer finance marketplace business
	in China through our PRC subsidiary, Heng Ye, and our consolidated variable interest entity, Heng Cheng. Due to PRC legal restrictions
	on foreign ownership and investment in value-added telecommunications services, and internet content provision services in particular,
	we conduct our online operations in China through a series of contractual arrangements entered into between Heng Ye and Heng Cheng
	and its shareholders. Heng Cheng operates our website www.yirendai.com and has an ICP license as an internet information provider.
	Most of our revenues, costs and expenses directly related to loan facilitation and servicing in China are generated through Heng
	Cheng. As a result of the contractual arrangements, we have the ability to direct the activities of Heng Cheng that most significantly
	impact its economic performance, and to obtain a majority of the residual returns of Heng Cheng. We are considered the primary
	beneficiary of Heng Cheng, and accordingly the entity is our variable interest entity under U.S.&nbsp;GAAP and we consolidate
	its results in our consolidated financial statements. Any changes in PRC laws and regulations that affect our ability to control

	In October 2015, as part of our strategy to expand our
	investor base from individual investors to institutional investors, we entered into a business relationship with a trust,
	which invested in loans through our platform using funds received from its sole beneficiary. We hold a variable interest in
	the trust through the transaction fee charged, as the terms of the arrangement are not customarily presented in arrangements
	for similar services. The security deposit provided to the trust by us also constitutes a variable interest in the trust as
	it guarantees the value of the loans invested in by the trust. Given that (i) the trust is a static investment fund, and (ii)
	RMB250 million (US$38.6) million was invested in loans by the trust at its inception, loan servicing and default loan
	collection performed by us are the activities that have the most significant impact on the trust&rsquo;s economic
	performance. Therefore, we have the power to direct the activities of the trust. Without considering the defaults and the
	re-investment return, the expected return of the trust is approximately 12% of the loan&rsquo;s face value. Our transaction
	fee arrangement requires approximately 27.6% of the loan&rsquo;s face value as an upfront fee. Although the fee is refundable
	depending on the loan repayment timing, it still could be significant to the variable interest entity, if not the most
	significant. As a result, we also have the right to receive from the variable interest entity the benefits that could
	potentially be significant to the variable interest entity. Therefore, we are the primary beneficiary of the trust and
	consolidate the trust.

	fund either through expiry or performance. We also track our stand-ready liability on a loan-by-loan basis to monitor the expiration
	of each individual loan and recognize the revenue on expiration. The recognition of a contingent liability results in the recognition
	of expenses as debit to earnings. To determine our contingent liability, we also perform ongoing, monthly assessments of the probable
	estimated losses based on historical charge-off rates of different loan grades and qualitative factors, such as borrower profile
	and behavior, current economic conditions, and other factors affecting credit quality. On a portfolio basis, if the contingent
	liability exceeds the stand-ready liability, we will recognize the amount that is in excess of the risk reserve fund liability
	as expense. When we make payouts from the risk reserve fund upon occasions of default, such payouts are recorded as a reduction
	of the stand-ready liability. We present the revenues from releasing of stand-ready liability and expenses from recognition of
	contingent liability related to the risk reserve fund service on a net basis, which will be referred to as &ldquo;net gain/(loss)

	We have adopted the measurement alternative included in ASU
	2014-13, the new collateralized financing entity (&ldquo;CFE&rdquo;) guidance. Amounts presented for the year ended December
	31, 2015 in the consolidated statements of operations reflect the adoption of this accounting guidance in 2015.

	Pursuant to the new CFE guidance, we measure both the financial
	assets and financial liabilities of the consolidated asset backed financing entity in our consolidated financial statements using
	the more observable of the fair value of the financial assets and the fair value of the financial liabilities. We believe the
	fair value of the financial assets of the consolidated trust is more observable than the fair value of the financial liability
	of the consolidated trust. As a result, the loans of the consolidated trust are measured at fair value and the payable to fund
	is measured in consolidation as: (i) the sum of the fair value of the loans and the carrying value of any non-financial assets
	that are incidental to the operations of the trust less (ii) the sum of the fair value of loan default loss borne by us through
	the security deposit. The resulting amount is allocated to the individual financial liabilities (other than the beneficial interest
	retained by us) using a reasonable and consistent methodology. Under the measurement alternative, our consolidated net income
	reflects our own economic interests in the consolidated trust including changes in the fair value of the beneficial interests
	retained by us, which is the fair value of the loan default loss borne by us through the security deposit.

	As our loans and related payable to fund are not traded in
	an active market with readily observable prices, we use significant unobservable inputs to measure the fair value of these assets
	and liabilities. Financial instruments are categorized in the Level 3 valuation hierarchy based on the significance of unobservable
	factors in the overall fair value measurement.

	As of December 31, 2015, the significant unobservable inputs
	used in the fair value measurement of the loans of the consolidated trust include the discount rate applied in the valuation models,
	default and recovery rates applied in the valuation models, and early prepayment rates. These inputs in isolation can cause significant
	increases or decreases in fair value. Specifically, when a discounted cash flow model is used to determine fair value, the significant
	input used in the valuation model is the discount rate applied to present value the projected cash flows. Increases in the discount
	rate can significantly lower the fair value of loans and decreases in the discount rate can significantly increase the fair value
	of loans. The discount rate is determined based on the market rates.

	In August 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-13, &ldquo;Consolidation
	(Topic 810): Measuring the Financial Assets and the Financial Liabilities of a Consolidated Collateralized Financing Entity.&rdquo;
	The guidance is to eliminate diversity in practice in the accounting for measurement differences in both the initial consolidation
	and subsequent measurement of the financial assets and the financial liabilities of a collateralized financing entity. A reporting
	entity that consolidates a collateralized financing entity within the scope of the new guidance may elect to measure the financial
	assets and the financial liabilities of that collateralized financing entity using either the measurement alternative included
	in the new guidance or the existing guidance on fair value measurement. When a reporting entity elects the measurement alternative
	included in the new guidance for a collateralized financing entity, the reporting entity should measure both the financial assets
	and the financial liabilities of that collateralized financing entity in its consolidated financial statements using the more
	observable of the fair value of the financial assets and the fair value of the financial liabilities. The guidance is effective
	for interim and annual reporting periods in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015. Early adoption is permitted. As noted

	In February 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-02, &ldquo;Consolidation
	(Topic 810) &mdash; Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis&rdquo;. The amendments in Topic 810 respond to stakeholders&rsquo;
	concerns about the current accounting for consolidation of variable interest entities, by changing aspects of the analysis that
	a reporting entity must perform to determine whether it should consolidate such entities. Under the amendments, all reporting
	entities are within the scope of Subtopic 810-10, Consolidation &ndash; Overall, including limited partnerships and similar legal
	entities, unless a scope exception applies. The amendments are intended to be an improvement to current U.S. GAAP, as they simplify
	the codification of FASB Statement No. 167, Amendments to FASB Interpretation No. 46 (R), with changes including reducing the
	number of consolidation models through the elimination of the indefinite deferral of Statement 167 and placing more emphasis on

	, &ldquo;Financial Instruments&mdash;Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and
	Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities.&rdquo; This guidance revises, among other things, (i) the accounting
	related to the classification and measurement of investments in equity securities, (ii) the presentation of certain fair value
	changes in financial liabilities measured at fair value, and (iii) certain disclosure requirements. The guidance requires that
	all equity investments, except those accounted for under the equity method of accounting or those resulting in the consolidation
	of the investee, be accounted for at fair value with all fair value changes recognized in income. For financial liabilities measured
	using the fair value option, the guidance requires that any change in fair value caused by a change in instrument-specific credit
	risk be presented separately in other comprehensive income until the liability is settled or reaches maturity. The guidance is
	effective for interim and annual reporting periods in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, with early adoption permitted
	for certain provisions. A reporting entity would generally record a cumulative-effect adjustment to beginning retained earnings
	as of the beginning of the first reporting period in which the guidance is adopted. We are in the process of evaluating the impact
	that this guidance will have on our consolidated financial statements.

	In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic
	842). The guidance supersedes existing guidance on accounting for leases with the main difference being that operating leases
	are recorded in the statement of financial position as right-of-use assets and lease liabilities, initially measured at the present
	value of the lease payments. For operating leases with a term of 12 months or less, a lessee is permitted to make an accounting
	policy election not to recognize lease assets and liabilities. For public business entities, the guidance is effective for fiscal
	years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early application of the guidance
	is permitted. In transition, entities are required to recognize and measure leases at the beginning of the earliest period presented
	using a modified retrospective approach. We are in the process of evaluating the impact that this guidance will have on its consolidated
	financial statements.

	Prior to the establishment of Yirendai Ltd., our online consumer
	finance marketplace business was carried out by various subsidiaries and variable interest entities of CreditEase as a business
	unit under CreditEase. We completed our carve-out from CreditEase in the first quarter of 2015. In 2013 and 2014, our principal
	sources of liquidity were advances from our parent company, CreditEase, representing operating costs and expenses paid or borne
	by the various entities affiliated with CreditEase on our behalf. We will not have such advances from CreditEase going forward.

	In 2015, our principal sources of liquidity have been cash
	generated from operating activities and proceeds from the issuance and sale of our shares. We generated positive cash flow from
	operating activities of US$60.2 million in 2015. In December 2015, we completed our initial public offering in which we issued
	and sold an aggregate of 7,500,000 ADSs, representing 15,000,000 ordinary shares, resulting in net proceeds to us of approximately
	US$64.9 million. Concurrently with our initial public offering, we sold 2,000,000 ordinary shares to Baidu Hong Kong via a private
	placement, resulting in net proceeds to us of approximately US$9.0 million. As of December 31, 2015, we had cash and cash equivalents

	As of December 31, 2015, we had restricted cash of approximately
	US$74.7 million, as compared to nil as of December 31, 2014. The restricted cash represented the amount of cash we set aside in
	the risk reserve fund that was launched on January 1, 2015. When we make payouts from the risk reserve fund upon occasions of
	default, such payouts will reduce the balance of our restricted cash. We monitor the balance of the risk reserve fund on a monthly
	basis, and adjust on a quarterly basis by putting an appropriate additional amount of cash into the risk reserve fund as needed
	to ensure we can sufficiently cover the expected payouts. We expect that our restricted cash balance will continue to increase
	in the near future.

	Unlike financial institutions, we are not subject to any capital
	adequacy requirement that is applicable to financial institutions in China. We believe that our anticipated cash flows from operating
	activities, together with the capital contributions we expect to receive from CreditEase, will be sufficient to meet our anticipated
	working capital requirements and capital expenditures in the ordinary course of business for the next 12 months. We may, however,
	need additional cash resources in the future if we experience changes in business conditions or other developments, or if we find
	and wish to pursue opportunities for investment, acquisition, capital expenditure or similar actions. If we determine that our
	cash requirements exceed the amount of cash and cash equivalents we have on hand at the time, we may seek to issue equity or debt
	securities or obtain credit facilities. The issuance and sale of additional equity would result in further dilution to our shareholders.
	The incurrence of indebtedness would result in increased fixed obligations and could result in operating covenants that would
	restrict our operations. We cannot assure you that financing will be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us, if at
	all. See &ldquo;Item 3. Key Information&mdash;D. Risk Factors&mdash;Risks Related to Our Business&mdash;We may need additional

	Our accounts receivable primarily include the transaction fees
	receivable from borrowers. As of December&nbsp;31, 2013, 2014 and 2015, we had accounts receivable of US$3.1 million, US$26.0
	million and US$12.8 million, respectively. The increase from December 31, 2013 to December 31, 2014 was in line with the substantial
	increase in our revenues from 2013 to 2014. In 2013 and 2014, we recognized revenue from transaction fees upfront upon completion
	of the services of facilitating loan transactions, and no allowances for uncollectable accounts receivable were recorded as of
	December&nbsp;31, 2013 and 2014 as all accounts receivable were guaranteed by Tian Da Xin An. In 2013 and up to the nine months
	ended September&nbsp;30, 2014, borrowers paid the transaction fees primarily on a monthly basis over the term of the loan. In
	the fourth quarter of 2014, we adopted a new fee collection schedule whereby we either collect the entire amount of the transaction
	fee upfront upon completion of our loan facilitation services, or collect a portion of the transaction fee upfront and the rest
	on a monthly basis over the term of the loan. Due to our switch from the third-party guarantee arrangement to the risk reserve
	fund model, starting in the first quarter of 2015, we have adopted a new revenue recognition policy&mdash;for the fees collected
	upfront, we recognize revenue upon completion of the loan facilitation services, while for the fees collected on a monthly basis
	over the term of a loan, we recognize revenue when the fees are collected. As a result, we did not record additional accounts
	receivable during 2015 and no allowance for uncollectable accounts receivable was recorded as of December 31, 2015. Accordingly,
	our accounts receivable as of December 31, 2015 decreased from that as of December 31, 2014, and we expect that our accounts receivable
	will continue to decrease going forward.

	Our prepaid expenses and other assets include primarily funds
	receivable from external payment networks, and our accrued expenses and other liabilities include primarily funds payable to investors
	or borrowers. The funds receivable from external payment networks and funds payable are a result of our use of master custody
	accounts with various external payment networks. Borrower and investor funds are deposited into master custody accounts managed
	by any one of the external payment networks we utilize. We use these accounts to collect and transfer loan funds to borrowers
	and to collect and repay loan principal and interest to investors. We also use such accounts to collect the transaction fees and
	service fees we charge, and to repay and collect default loan principal and interest. Funds receivable from such external payment
	networks include funds received from investors but not yet transferred to borrowers, repayments of principal and interest received
	from borrowers but not yet transferred to investors, and transaction fees and service fees received but not yet transferred to
	us, by the external payment networks due to a settlement time lag. Similarly, we also have funds payable to investors or borrowers
	due to a settlement time lag with such external payment networks. In August 2015, we fully migrated to a new system whereby China
	Guangfa Bank not only maintains an account for us but also maintains separate in trust for, or ITF, accounts for borrowers and
	investors. With this arrangement, we may have less funds receivable from external payment networks and funds payable on our balance

	Net cash generated from operating activities was US$60.2 million
	in 2015. In 2015, the principal items accounting for the difference between our net cash generated from operating activities and
	our net income of US$43.8 million were changes in certain working capital accounts, principally an increase in risk reserve fund
	liabilities of US$87.0 million and a decrease in accounts receivable of US$12.4 million, partially offset by an increase in restricted
	cash in US$74.1 million and an increase in deferred tax assets of US$28.0 million. Risk reserve fund liabilities increased primarily
	because we launched our new risk reserve fund starting from January 1, 2015, under which if a loan originated on or after January
	1, 2015 defaults, we would cover on a portfolio basis the principal and accrued interest repayment of the defaulted loan using
	cash set aside in our risk reserve fund up to the balance of the risk reserve fund. For the first three quarters of 2015, we set
	aside in the risk reserve fund an amount equal to 6% of the loans facilitated through our marketplace during the period. This
	amount is not sufficient to cover all expected payouts for loans facilitated during this period. Starting in the fourth quarter
	of 2015, we have set aside sufficient cash in the risk reserve fund to cover expected payouts by putting an appropriate additional
	amount of cash from other sources into the risk reserve fund on a quarterly basis, as needed. The decrease in accounts receivable
	was due to the change in our revenue recognition policy in the first quarter of 2015. See &ldquo;&mdash;Cash Flows and Working
	Capital.&rdquo; The increase in restricted cash was due to the cash we set aside in the risk reserve fund, which was partially
	offset by payouts from the risk reserve fund upon occasions of default. We recognized deferred tax assets in 2015 mainly due to
	liabilities from our risk reserve fund service.

	assets of US$31.1 million, partially offset by an increase in accrued expenses and other liabilities of US$27.5 million, and an
	increase in accounts receivable of US$23.1 million. The increase in prepaid expenses and other assets was (i)&nbsp;primarily due
	to the increase in funds receivable from the external payment networks, which include funds received from investors but not yet
	transferred to borrowers, repayments of loan and interest received from borrowers but not yet transferred to investors, and transaction
	fees and service fees received but not yet transferred to us, by the external payment networks due to a settlement time lag, and
	(ii)&nbsp;to a lesser extent, due to an increase in the deposits we paid to third parties for online marketing and user acquisition
	services. The increase in accrued expenses and other liabilities was primarily attributable to the increase in funds payable to
	investors or borrowers due to a settlement time lag with the external payment networks used to collect and transfer loan funds
	to borrowers and collect and repay loan principal and interest to investors. The increase in our accounts receivable was due to
	the significant growth of loan volume on our marketplace in 2014.

	Yirendai Ltd. is a holding company with no material operations

	a result, Yirendai Ltd.&rsquo;s ability to pay dividends depends upon dividends paid by Heng Ye, our PRC subsidiary, and Heng
	Cheng, our consolidated variable interest entity. If our existing PRC subsidiary or any newly formed ones incur debt on their
	own behalf in the future, the instruments governing their debt may restrict their ability to pay dividends to us. In addition,
	our wholly foreign-owned subsidiary in China is permitted to pay dividends to us only out of its retained earnings, if any, as
	determined in accordance with PRC accounting standards and regulations. Under PRC law, each of our subsidiary and our consolidated
	variable interest entity in China is required to set aside at least 10% of its after-tax profits each year, if any, to fund certain
	statutory reserve funds until such reserve funds reach 50% of its registered capital. In addition, our wholly foreign-owned subsidiary
	in China may allocate a portion of its after-tax profits based on PRC accounting standards to enterprise expansion funds and staff
	bonus and welfare funds at its discretion, and our consolidated variable interest entity may allocate a portion of its after-tax
	profits based on PRC accounting standards to a discretionary surplus fund at its discretion. The statutory reserve funds and the
	discretionary funds are not distributable as cash dividends. Remittance of dividends by a wholly foreign-owned company out of
	China is subject to examination by the banks designated by SAFE. Our PRC subsidiary has not paid dividends and will not be able
	to pay dividends until it generates accumulated profits and meet the requirements for statutory reserve funds.

	Our board of directors consists of seven directors. A director
	is not required to hold any shares in our company to qualify to serve as a director. A director who is in any way, whether directly
	or indirectly, interested in a contract or transaction or proposed contract or transaction with our company must declare the nature
	of his interest at a meeting of the directors. Subject to NYSE rules and disqualification by the chairman of the relevant board
	meeting, a director may vote in respect of any contract or transaction or proposed contract or transaction notwithstanding that
	he may be interested therein and if he does so his vote shall be counted and he may be counted in the quorum at the relevant board
	meeting at which such contract or transaction or proposed contract or transaction is considered. The directors may exercise all
	the powers of the company to borrow money, to mortgage or charge its undertaking, property and uncalled capital, and to issue
	debentures or other securities whenever money is borrowed or as security for any debt, liability or obligation of the company
	or of any third party. None of our non-executive directors has a service contract with us that provides for benefits upon termination
	of service.

	Tian Da Xin An (Beijing) Guarantee Co., Ltd., or Tian Da Xin

	in August 2013, we paid Tian Da Xin An a one-time fee of US$0.3 million for its assumption of the outstanding loan balances covered
	under our previous risk reserve fund. From August 2013 to December 2014, we had a guarantee arrangement with Tian Da Xin An to
	provide investors with the option of purchasing the assurance that their principal and interest would be repaid in the event that
	their loans default. Tian Da Xin An was responsible for repaying the principal and accrued interest of the default loan and it
	charged the investor 10% of the monthly loan interest for the guarantee service. In practice, we reimbursed the loan principal
	and accrued interest to the investor in the first place in the case of default, and then collected the amount from Tian Da Xin
	An, and we collected from the investor the guarantee service fee charged by Tian Da Xin An on its behalf, and then remit the amount
	to Tian Da Xin An. The balance of amount due to Tian Da Xin An as of December 31, 2013 and amount due from Tian Da Xin An as of
	December 31, 2014 and December 31, 2015 represent the net amount of services fee payable and receivable arising from guarantee
	fee, default loan principal and accrued interest due to borrowers as well as uncollectible transaction fee. The guarantee arrangement
	has been replaced by our new risk reserve fund since January 2015. All loans originated on or after January 1, 2015 are covered
	under the risk reserve fund, and the outstanding balance of the loans guaranteed under the previous guarantee arrangement will

	Under the PRC Enterprise Income Tax Law and its implementation
	rules, an enterprise established outside of the PRC with a &ldquo;de facto management body&rdquo; within the PRC is considered
	a resident enterprise and will be subject to the enterprise income tax at the rate of 25% on its global income. The implementation
	rules define the term &ldquo;de facto management body&rdquo; as the body that exercises full and substantial control over and
	overall management of the business, productions, personnel, accounts and properties of an enterprise. In April 2009, the State
	Administration of Taxation issued a circular, known as Circular 82, which provides certain specific criteria for determining whether
	the &ldquo;de facto management body&rdquo; of a PRC-controlled enterprise that is incorporated offshore is located in China. Although
	this circular only applies to offshore enterprises controlled by PRC enterprises or PRC enterprise groups, not those controlled
	by PRC individuals or foreigners, the criteria set forth in the circular may reflect the State Administration of Taxation&rsquo;s
	general position on how the &ldquo;de facto management body&rdquo; test should be applied in determining the tax resident status
	of all offshore enterprises. According to Circular 82, an offshore incorporated enterprise controlled by a PRC enterprise or a
	PRC enterprise group will be regarded as a PRC tax resident by virtue of having its &ldquo;de facto management body&rdquo; in
	China only if all of the following conditions are met: (i)&nbsp;the primary location of the day-to-day operational management
	is in the PRC; (ii)&nbsp;decisions relating to the enterprise&rsquo;s financial and human resource matters are made or are subject
	to approval by organizations or personnel in the PRC; (iii)&nbsp;the enterprise&rsquo;s primary assets, accounting books and records,
	company seals, and board and shareholder resolutions, are located or maintained in the PRC; and (iv)&nbsp;at least 50% of voting
	board members or senior executives habitually reside in the PRC.

	The State Administration of Tax issued a Public Notice, or
	Public Notice 16, on March 18, 2015, to further regulate and strengthen the transfer pricing administration on outbound payments
	by a PRC enterprise to its overseas related parties. In addition to emphasizing that outbound payments by a PRC enterprise to
	its overseas related parties must comply with arm&rsquo;s-length principles, Public Notice 16 specifies certain circumstances
	whereby such payments are not deductible for the purpose of the enterprise income tax of the PRC enterprise, including payments
	to an overseas related party which does not undertake any function, bear any risk or has no substantial operation or activities,
	payments for services which do not enable the PRC enterprise to obtain direct or indirect economic benefits, or for services that
	are unrelated to the functions and risks borne by the PRC enterprise, or relate to the protection of the investment interests
	of the direct or indirect investor of the PRC enterprise, or for services that have already been purchased from a third party
	or undertaken by the PRC enterprise itself, and royalties paid to an overseas related party which only owns the legal rights of
	the intangible assets but has no contribution to the creation of such intangible assets. Although we believe all our related party
	transactions, including all payments by our PRC subsidiaries and consolidated affiliated entities to our non-PRC entities, are
	made on an arm&rsquo;s-length basis and our estimates are reasonable, the ultimate decisions by the relevant tax authorities may
	differ from the amounts recorded in our financial statements and may materially affect our financial results in the period or
	periods for which such determination is made.

	We believe that none of our entities outside of China is a
	PRC resident enterprise for PRC tax purposes. We do not believe that Yirendai Ltd. meets all of the conditions above. Yirendai
	Ltd. is a company incorporated outside the PRC. As a holding company, its key assets are its ownership interests in its subsidiaries,
	and its key assets are located, and its records (including the resolutions of its board of directors and the resolutions of its
	shareholders) are maintained, outside the PRC. For the same reasons, we believe our other entities outside of China are not PRC
	resident enterprises either. However, the tax resident status of an enterprise is subject to determination by the PRC tax authorities
	and uncertainties remain with respect to the interpretation of the term &ldquo;de facto management body.&rdquo; There can be no
	assurance that the PRC government will ultimately take a view that is consistent with us.

	However, if the PRC tax authorities determine that Yirendai
	Ltd. is a PRC resident enterprise for enterprise income tax purposes, we may be required to withhold a 10% withholding tax from
	dividends we pay to our shareholders that are non-resident enterprises, including the holders of our ADSs. In addition, non-resident
	enterprise shareholders (including our ADS holders) may be subject to a 10% PRC tax on gains realized on the sale or other disposition
	of ADSs or ordinary shares, if such income is treated as sourced from within the PRC. It is unclear whether our non-PRC individual
	shareholders (including our ADS holders) would be subject to any PRC tax on dividends or gains obtained by such non-PRC individual
	shareholders in the event we are determined to be a PRC resident enterprise. If any PRC tax were to apply to such dividends or
	gains, it would generally apply at a rate of 20% unless a reduced rate is available under an applicable tax treaty. However, it
	is also unclear whether non-PRC shareholders of Yirendai Ltd. would be able to claim the benefits of any tax treaties between
	their country of tax residence and the PRC in the event that Yirendai Ltd. is treated as a PRC resident enterprise.

	Provided that our Cayman Islands holding company, Yirendai
	Ltd., is not deemed to be a PRC resident enterprise, holders of our ADSs and ordinary shares who are not PRC residents will not
	be subject to PRC income tax on dividends distributed by us or gains realized from the sale or other disposition of our shares
	or ADSs. However, under SAT Circular&nbsp;698 and Circular 7, where a non-resident enterprise conducts an &ldquo;indirect transfer&rdquo;
	by transferring taxable assets, including, in particular, equity interests in a PRC resident enterprise, indirectly by disposing
	of the equity interests of an overseas holding company, the non-resident enterprise, being the transferor, or the transferee or

	a &ldquo;substance over form&rdquo; principle, the PRC tax authority may disregard the existence of the overseas holding company
	if it lacks a reasonable commercial purpose and was established for the purpose of reducing, avoiding or deferring PRC tax. As
	a result, gains derived from such indirect transfer may be subject to PRC enterprise income tax, and the transferee or other person
	who is obligated to pay for the transfer is obligated to withhold the applicable taxes, currently at a rate of 10% for the transfer
	of equity interests in a PRC resident enterprise. We and our non-PRC resident investors may be at risk of being required to file&nbsp;a

	No ruling has been sought from the Internal Revenue Service (the &ldquo;IRS&rdquo;) with respect to any United States federal

	a straddle, hedge, conversion, constructive sale, or other integrated transaction for United States federal income tax purposes,
	or investors that have a functional currency other than the United States dollar, all of whom may be subject to tax rules that
	differ significantly from those summarized below. In addition, this discussion does not discuss any non-United States, alternative
	minimum tax, state, or local tax considerations, or the Medicare tax on net investment income. Each U.S. holder is urged to consult

	All of our revenues and substantially all of our expenses are
	denominated in RMB, whereas our reporting currency is the U.S. dollar. In our consolidated financial statements, our financial
	information that uses RMB as the functional currency has been translated into U.S. dollars. Due to foreign currency translation
	adjustments, we had a foreign exchange gain of US$49,000 in 2013, a foreign exchange loss of US$0.3 million in 2014, and a foreign
	exchange loss of US$2.9 million in 2015. Appreciation or depreciation in the value of the RMB relative to the U.S. dollar would
	affect our financial results reported in U.S. dollar terms without giving effect to any underlying change in our business or results
	of operations.

	We do not believe that we currently have any significant direct
	foreign exchange risk and have not used any derivative financial instruments to hedge exposure to such risk. Although in general
	our exposure to foreign exchange risks should be limited, the value of your investment in our ADSs will be affected by the exchange
	rate between U.S. dollar and RMB because the value of our business is effectively denominated in RMB, while our ADSs will be traded
	in U.S. dollars.

	The conversion of RMB into foreign currencies, including U.S.
	dollars, is based on rates set by the PBOC. The PRC government allowed the RMB to appreciate by more than 20% against the U.S.
	dollar between July 2005 and July 2008. Between July 2008 and June 2010, the exchange rate between the RMB and the U.S.&nbsp;dollar
	had been stable and traded within a narrow band. Since June 2010, the RMB has fluctuated against the U.S. dollar, at times significantly
	and unpredictably. It is difficult to predict how long the current situation may last and when and how the relationship between
	the RMB and the U.S. dollar may change again.

	To the extent that we need to convert U.S. dollars into RMB
	for our operations, appreciation of the RMB against the U.S. dollar would have an adverse effect on the RMB amount we receive
	from the conversion. Conversely, if we decide to convert RMB into U.S. dollars for the purpose of making payments for dividends
	on our ordinary shares or ADSs or for other business purposes, appreciation of the U.S. dollar against the RMB would have a negative
	effect on the U.S. dollar amounts available to us.

	The depositary fees payable upon the issuance and cancellation

	The depositary fees payable for cash distributions are generally
	deducted from the cash being distributed or by selling a portion of distributable property to pay the fees. In the case of distributions
	other than cash (i.e., share dividends, rights), the depositary bank charges the applicable fee to the ADS record date holders
	concurrent with the distribution. In the case of ADSs registered in the name of the investor (whether certificated or uncertificated
	in direct registration), the depositary bank sends invoices to the applicable record date ADS holders. In the case of ADSs held
	in brokerage and custodian accounts (via DTC), the depositary bank generally collects its fees through the systems provided by
	DTC (whose nominee is the registered holder of the ADSs held in DTC) from the brokers and custodians holding ADSs in their DTC
	accounts. The brokers and custodians who hold their clients&rsquo; ADSs in DTC accounts in turn charge their clients&rsquo; accounts

	requirements to properly address complex U.S.&nbsp;GAAP accounting issues and to prepare and review our consolidated financial
	statements and related disclosures to fulfill U.S.&nbsp;GAAP and SEC financial reporting requirements. The other material weakness
	that has been identified related to our lack of comprehensive accounting policies and procedures manual in accordance with U.S.

	We have implemented and plan to implement a number of measures
	to address the material weaknesses that have been identified. We have hired additional qualified financial and accounting staff
	with U.S.&nbsp;GAAP and SEC reporting experience, including our chief financial officer and financial controller. We have allocated
	additional resources to improve financial oversight function, and to prepare and review the consolidated financial statements
	and related disclosures in accordance with U.S.&nbsp;GAAP and SEC reporting requirements. As of December 31, 2015, we determined
	that the above mentioned material weaknesses haved been remediated. Furthermore, we will continue to hire additional competent
	accounting staff with appropriate knowledge and experience of U.S.&nbsp;GAAP and SEC reporting requirements, and will provide
	sufficient and additional appropriate training to our accounting and financial reporting personnel, especially training related
	to U.S.&nbsp;GAAP and SEC reporting requirements. We will also develop and implement a full set of U.S. GAAP accounting policies
	and financial reporting procedures as well as related internal control policies, including implementing a comprehensive accounting
	manual to guide day-to-day accounting operations and reporting work. We expect to complete the measures discussed above as soon
	as practicable and will continue to implement measures to remediate our internal control deficiencies to comply with Section&nbsp;404
	of the Sarbanes Oxley Act. We expect that we will incur significant costs in the implementation of such measures. However, we
	cannot assure you that all these measures will be sufficient to remediate our material weaknesses in time, or at all. See &ldquo;Item

	We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the

	reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. The Company is not required to
	have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. Our audits included consideration
	of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances,
	but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group&rsquo;s internal control over financial reporting.
	Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
	disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management,
	as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for
	our opinion.

	Cheng was established on September 15, 2014 as the operating entity in PRC of the Yirendai Business in contemplating raising

	Yan Tian, three PRC citizens, as the shareholders of Heng Cheng (collectively the &ldquo;three designated shareholders&rdquo;)
	on behalf of CreditEase. The capital injected into Heng Cheng by the three designated shareholders was provided by CreditEase

	de facto agent of CreditEase, and CreditEase should consolidate Heng Cheng as a VIE.

	In concluding that the Company is the primary beneficiary

	it with a substantive kick out right. More specifically, the Company believes the terms of the exclusive option agreements are
	valid, binding and enforceable under PRC laws and regulations currently in effect. A simple majority vote of the Company&rsquo;s
	board of directors is required to pass a resolution to exercise Heng Ye&rsquo;s rights under the exclusive option agreements,
	for which consent of the shareholders of Heng Cheng is not required. Heng Ye&rsquo;s rights under the exclusive option agreements
	give the Company the power to control the shareholders of Heng Cheng and thus the power to direct the activities that most significantly
	impact the Heng Cheng&rsquo;s economic performance. In addition, Heng Ye&rsquo;s rights under the powers of attorney also reinforce
	the Company&rsquo;s abilities to direct the activities that most significantly impact Heng Cheng&rsquo;s economic performance.
	The Company also believes that this ability to exercise control ensures that Heng Cheng will continue to execute and renew services
	agreements and pay service fees to the Company. The exclusive business cooperation agreement will be terminated upon the expiration
	of the operation term of either party if the application for renewal of its operation term is not approved by the relevant government
	authorities. As a result, the Company believes that it has the rights to receive substantially all of the economic benefits from
	Heng Cheng.

	The interests of the shareholders of Heng Cheng may diverge

	Cheng, on the one hand, and as beneficial owners and directors of the Company, on the other hand. The Company believes the shareholders
	of Heng Cheng will not act contrary to any of the contractual arrangements and the exclusive option agreements provide the Company
	with a mechanism to remove the current shareholders of Heng Cheng should they act to the detriment of the Company. The Company
	relies on certain current shareholders of Heng Cheng to fulfill their fiduciary duties and abide by laws of the PRC and act in
	the best interest of the Company. If the Company cannot resolve any conflicts of interest or disputes between the Company and
	the shareholders of Heng Cheng, the Company would have to rely on legal proceedings, which could result in disruption of its business,

	As part of the Group's strategy to expand its investor
	base from individual investors to institutional investors, in October 2015, the Company established a business relationship with
	the Trust under which the Trust invested in loans through the Company's platform using funds received from its sole beneficiary.
	The Trust is administered by a third-party state-owned trust company (&quot;the trust company&quot;), which acts as the trustee,
	for the purposes of providing returns to its sole beneficiary through extending loans up to an aggregate principal amount of US$38.6
	million to borrowers recommended by the Company. The Trust&rsquo;s settlor and sole beneficiary is a fund managed by Zhe Hao Shanghai
	Asset Management Company, or Zhe Hao, an affiliate of CreditEase (&quot;the Fund&quot;).

	Under the Cooperator&rsquo;s Service and Management Agreement
	between the Company and the trust company, the Company provides loan facilitation and post-origination services to the Trust.
	The Company does not charge the Trust any direct fee. Instead, fee is charged from the borrowers upon the inception of the loan.
	A loan agreement was signed between the trust company (as lender) and the borrowers. Through a separate loan service contract,
	the Company charges transaction fee from the borrowers. There is a transaction fee refund clause that differentiates this contract
	from other similar contracts signed by the Company. This clause will cause the Company to retain some level of prepayment risk
	on the underlying loans in the Trust.

	Under a deposit agreement between the Company and the

	security fund to protect the Trust from potential losses from loan default. Regardless of the default rate of the loans invested
	by the Trust, the Company will not transfer any additional cash into the Trust&rsquo;s security fund other than the foregoing
	amount. When a default occurs, the Trust will use cash from the security fund to cover the defaulted amount. When the Trust is
	dissolved, if the amount of payouts remains below 20% of the cash set aside in the security fund, the remainder of the security
	fund will be returned to the Company. Otherwise, the remainder of the security fund will become part of the Trust&rsquo;s assets

	Without considering the defaults and the re-investment

	loan repayment timing, it still could be significant to the VIE. As a result, the Company also has
	the right to receive benefits from the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE.

	Starting from January&nbsp;1, 2015, the Group terminated
	the relationship with Tian Da Xin An, the guarantee company, and launched a new investor protection service in the form of a financial
	guarantee called the risk reserve fund. If a loan originated on or after January&nbsp;1, 2015 defaults, the Group guarantees the
	principal and accrued interest repayment of the defaulted loan up to the balance of the risk reserve fund on a portfolio basis.
	The risk reserve fund being set aside equals 6%-7% of the total loan facilitation amount. The Group reserves the right to revise
	the percentage upwards or downwards as a result of the Group&rsquo;s continuing evaluation of factors such as market dynamics
	as well as of its product lines, profitability and cash position.

	According to ASC 460-10-35-1, the stand-ready liability
	initially recognized would typically be reduced (by a credit to earnings) as the Group is released from risk under the guarantee
	either through expiry or performance. The recognition of a contingent liability results in the recognition of expenses in earnings.
	The Group tracks its stand-ready liability on a loan-by-loan basis to monitor the expiration. When the Group releases the stand-ready
	liability through performance of the guarantee (by making payments on defaulted loans), it recognizes revenue along with the loss
	on defaulted loans. Revenue from releasing of stand-ready liability and expenses from recognition of contingent liability related
	to the risk reserve fund guarantee are presented on a net basis in the income statement. On a portfolio basis, when the aggregate
	contingent liability required to be recognized under ASC 450-20-25 exceeds the risk reserve fund liability balance, the Group
	will record the excess as expense.

	The fair value of the stand-ready liability associated
	with the risk reserve fund guarantee recorded at the inception of the loan was estimated using a discounted cash flow model to
	our expected payouts from the risk reserve fund, and also by incorporating a markup margin. The Group estimates its expected future
	payouts based on its current product mix as well as its estimates of expected net charge-off rates and expected collection rates
	and a discount rate. The expected future cash payout is capped at the restricted cash balance of the risk reserve fund. In the
	fourth quarter of 2015, in order to continue to attract new and retain existing investors and to remain consistent with the current
	industry practice in China, the Group set aside more cash in the risk reserve fund from the fourth quarter of 2015, based on its
	current business intention but not legal obligation, so that the balance in the risk reserve fund is enough to cover the expected
	payouts.

	to the past performance of similar products of CreditEase. Grade B and C loans have credit risks higher than Grade A but lower

	Pursuant to the new CFE guidance, the Company measures
	both the financial assets and financial liabilities of the consolidated asset backed financing entity in its consolidated financial
	statements using the more observable of the fair value of the financial assets and the fair value of the financial liabilities.
	The Company believes the fair value of the financial assets of the consolidated trust is more observable than the fair value of
	the financial liability of the consolidated trust. As a result, the loans of the consolidated trust are measured at fair value
	and the payable to fund is measured in consolidation as: (i) the sum of the fair value of the loans and the carrying value of
	any non-financial assets that are incidental to the operations of the trust less (ii) the sum of the fair value of loan default
	loss borne by the Company through the security deposit. The resulting amount is allocated to the individual financial liabilities
	(other than the beneficial interest retained by the Company) using a reasonable and consistent methodology. Under the measurement
	alternative, the Company&rsquo;s consolidated net income reflects the Company&rsquo;s own economic interests in the consolidated
	trust including changes in the fair value of the beneficial interests retained by the Company, which is the fair value of the
	loan default loss borne by the Company through the security deposit.

	In August 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-13, &quot;Consolidation
	(Topic 810): Measuring the Financial Assets and the Financial Liabilities of a Consolidated Collateralized Financing Entity&quot;
	The guidance is to eliminate diversity in practice in the accounting for measurement differences in both the initial consolidation
	and subsequent measurement of the financial assets and the financial liabilities of a collateralized financing entity. A reporting
	entity that consolidates a collateralized financing entity within the scope of the new guidance may elect to measure the financial
	assets and the financial liabilities of that collateralized financing entity using either the measurement alternative included
	in the new guidance or the existing guidance on fair value measurement. When a reporting entity elects the measurement alternative
	included in the new guidance for a collateralized financing entity, the reporting entity should measure both the financial assets
	and the financial liabilities of that collateralized financing entity in its consolidated financial statements using the more
	observable of the fair value of the financial assets and the fair value of the financial liabilities. The guidance is effective
	for interim and annual reporting periods in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015. Early adoption is permitted. As noted

	In February 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-02, &ldquo;Consolidation
	(Topic 810) &mdash; Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis&rdquo;. The amendments in Topic 810 respond to stakeholders&rsquo;
	concerns about the current accounting for consolidation of variable interest entities, by changing aspects of the analysis that
	a reporting entity must perform to determine whether it should consolidate such entities. Under the amendments, all reporting
	entities are within the scope of Subtopic 810-10, Consolidation &ndash; Overall, including limited partnerships and similar legal
	entities, unless a scope exception applies. The amendments are intended to be an improvement to current U.S. GAAP, as they simplify
	the codification of FASB Statement No. 167, Amendments to FASB Interpretation No. 46 (R), with changes including reducing the
	number of consolidation models through the elimination of the indefinite deferral of Statement 167 and placing more emphasis on
	risk of loss when determining a controlling financial interest. The amendments are effective for publicly-traded companies for
	fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015, and for interim periods within those fiscal years. Earlier adoption is permitted.

	, &quot;Financial Instruments&mdash;Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition
	and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities&quot; This guidance revises the accounting related to the classification
	and measurement of investments in equity securities as well as the presentation for certain fair value changes in financial liabilities
	measured at fair value, and amends certain disclosure requirements. The guidance requires that all equity investments, except
	those accounted for under the equity method of accounting or those resulting in the consolidation of the investee, be accounted
	for at fair value with all fair value changes recognized in income. For financial liabilities measured using the fair value option,
	the guidance requires that any change in fair value caused by a change in instrument-specific credit risk be presented separately
	in other comprehensive income until the liability is settled or reaches maturity. The guidance is effective for interim and annual
	reporting periods in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, with early adoption permitted for certain provisions. A reporting
	entity would generally record a cumulative-effect adjustment to beginning retained earnings as of the beginning of the first reporting
	period in which the guidance is adopted. The Group is in the process of evaluating the impact that this guidance will have on
	its consolidated financial statements.

	In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases
	(Topic 842). The guidance supersedes existing guidance on accounting for leases with the main difference being that operating
	leases are to be recorded in the statement of financial position as right-of-use assets and lease liabilities, initially measured
	at the present value of the lease payments. For operating leases with a term of 12 months or less, a lessee is permitted to make
	an accounting policy election not to recognize lease assets and liabilities. For public business entities, the guidance is effective
	for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early application of
	the guidance is permitted. In transition, entities are required to recognize and measure leases at the beginning of the earliest
	period presented using a modified retrospective approach. The Group is in the process of evaluating the impact that this guidance
	will have on its consolidated financial statements.

	As the Company&rsquo;s loans and related
	payable to the Fund do not trade in an active market with readily observable prices, the Company uses significant unobservable
	inputs to measure the fair value of these assets and liabilities. Financial instruments are categorized in the Level 3 valuation
	hierarchy based on the significance of unobservable factors in the overall fair value measurement. At December 31, 2015, the discounted
	cash flow methodology is used to estimate the fair value of loans. As of December 31, 2015, due to the adoption of ASU 2014-13
	(see Note 2), the payable to the Fund of the consolidated trust were measured on the basis of the fair value of the loans of the
	consolidated trust as the loans were determined to be more observable.

	As of December 31, 2015, the significant
	unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement of the loans of the consolidated trust include the discount rate applied
	in the valuation models, default and recovery rates applied in the valuation models, and early prepayment rates. These inputs
	in isolation can cause significant increases or decreases in fair value. Specifically, when a discounted cash flow model is used
	to determine fair value, the significant input used in the valuation model is the discount rate applied to present value the projected
	cash flows. Increases in the discount rate can significantly lower the fair value of loans; conversely a decrease in the discount
	rate can significantly increase the fair value of loans. The discount rate is determined based on the market rates.

	The fair value
	of the stand-ready liability associated with the risk reserve fund guarantee recorded at the inception of the loan was
	estimated using a discounted cash flow model to our expected payouts from the risk reserve fund, and also by incorporating a
	markup margin. The Company estimates its expected future payouts based on its current product mix as well as its estimates
	of expected net charge-off rates and expected collection rates and a discount rate. The expected future cash payout is capped
	at the restricted cash balance of the risk reserve fund. In the fourth quarter of 2015, in order to continue to attract new
	and retain existing investors and to remain consistent with the current industry practice in China, the Group set aside more
	cash in the risk reserve fund from the fourth quarter of 2015, based on its current business intention but not legal obligation,
	so that the balance in the risk reserve fund is enough to cover the expected payouts.

	Prior to establishment of the Group and the transfer
	of Yirendai Business, CreditEase has provided the Yirendai Business with origination and servicing, sales and marketing, general
	and administrative services. The Group expects CreditEase to continue to provide certain support services, but to the extent CreditEase
	does not continue to provide such support, the Group established its own support systems. The Group recorded expenses of the above
	services on an allocation basis for the purpose of preparing the accompanying consolidated financial statements. After the transfer
	of Yirendai Business into the Group, the Group entered into a series of reorganization agreements with CreditEase that governed
	the relationship between CreditEase and the Group and provided for, among other things, the provision of services by CreditEase
	to the Group and the allocation of liabilities and obligations attributable or related to periods or events prior to and in connection
	with the initial public offering (&ldquo;IPO&rdquo;). These service transactions between the Group and CreditEase are herein referred
	to as related party transactions.

	During August 2013 to December 2014, Yirendai Business
	worked with Tian Da Xin An, a subsidiary of consolidated VIEs of CreditEase, by introducing Tian Da Xin An as the guarantor in
	the loan facilitation agreements. Under such agreements, Tian Da Xin An guaranteed for the principal and interest paid to investors
	and for transaction fees paid to the Group in case of borrower default. Because Yirendai and Tian Da Xin An are under common control
	of CreditEase, Yirendai did not charge commission for referral business to Tian Da Xin An. Meanwhile, Tian Da Xin An did not charge
	guarantee fee for the guarantee service on transaction fee. As a result, no commission of referral or guarantee expense on the
	transaction fee was reflected in the accompanying financial statements. In January 2015, Yirendai provided investor protection
	services to investors in the form of a risk reserve fund as discussed in Note 2.

	Uncertainties exist with respect to how the current
	income tax law in the PRC applies to the Group&rsquo;s overall operations, and more specifically, with regard to tax residency
	status. The EIT Law includes a provision specifying that legal entities organized outside of the PRC will be considered residents
	for Chinese income tax purposes if the place of effective management or control is within the PRC. The implementation rules to
	the EIT Law provide that non-resident legal entities will be considered China residents if substantial and overall management
	and control over the manufacturing and business operations, personnel, accounting, properties, etc., occurs within the PRC. Despite
	the present uncertainties resulting from the limited PRC tax guidance on the issue, the Group does not believe that the legal
	entities organized outside of the PRC within the Group should be treated as residents for EIT law purposes. If the PRC tax authorities
	subsequently determine that the Company and its subsidiaries registered outside the PRC should be deemed resident enterprises,
	the Company and its subsidiaries registered outside the PRC will be subject to the PRC income taxes, at a rate of 25%.

	In January 2016, Zhe Hao (on behalf of the Fund) entered
	into arrangements with China International Capital Corporation Limited (the &ldquo;SPV Manager&quot; which is a third party investment

	the benefit from the Trust enjoyed by the Fund during the period prior to the transfer of US$2.1 million) (the &ldquo;Beneficial
	Right Asset&ldquo;) to the SPV Manager, and the SPV Manager created a Yiren Elite Loan Trust Beneficial Right Asset Backed Special

	Beneficial Right Asset to certain qualified institutional investors and individuals. Such ABS plan was approved by Shenzhen Stock
	Exchange for listing at the end of February 2016. The transfer of beneficiary rights from Zhe Hao to SPV was completed on April
	22, 2016. On the same date, the Group purchased US$7.3 million (equivalent to RMB47.5 million) Senior A Tranche securities. Puxin
	Hengye purchased all subordinated securities amounted to US$3.9 million (equivalent to RMB25 million) and two fund which were

	No. 28 Single Capital Trust (the &quot;Trust&quot;) is a trust established in the PRC
	and administered by an independent third-party state-owned trust company. In October
	2015, the registrant entered into a business relationship with the Trust, which invested
	in loans through the registrant&rsquo;s platform using funds received from its investor.
	Based on the contractual arrangement between the registrant and the Trust, the registrant

	the Trust's assets, liabilities, results of operations and cash flows in its consolidated
	financial statements included in this annual report. Please see Note 2 to the consolidated
	financial statements included in this annual report for the details of the basis of consolidation
