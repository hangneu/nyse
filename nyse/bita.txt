	We generate a significant portion of our revenues from providing
	internet marketing services to automakers and automobile dealers. However, internet marketing has not yet been widely accepted as an effective marketing platform by China&#146;s automotive industry. Many of our current or potential customers have
	not traditionally devoted a significant portion of their advertising or marketing budgets to web-based media. They may have limited experience with the internet as an advertising and marketing medium and therefore may not find the internet to be
	effective for promoting their automobiles and related services. Some automakers and dealers may still prefer television, outdoor billboards, traditional print and broadcast and may not be willing to spend a significant portion of their marketing
	budgets on online advertising. In addition, development of web software that blocks internet advertisements before they appear on a user&#146;s screen may hinder the growth of internet marketing. Our customers may choose not to use internet
	marketing services if their advertisements cannot reach the intended population due to the block function of this kind of software. Any negative perceptions as to the effectiveness of internet marketing services may limit the growth of our business
	and adversely affect our results of operations. If the internet does not become more widely accepted as a media platform for advertising and marketing, our business, financial position and results of operations could be materially and negatively
	affected.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:8%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Internet usage in China is limited among the general population. China has a relatively low penetration rate compared to most
	developed countries. The relatively high cost of internet access may limit the increase in internet penetration rate in China. The relatively underdeveloped telecommunications infrastructure and capacity constraints may further impede the
	development of the internet to the extent that users experience delays, transmission errors and other difficulties. In addition, China has only recently developed the internet as a commercial medium and as a result, our internet marketing business
	is subject to many uncertainties, which could materially and adversely affect our business prospects, financial condition and results of operations.

<I>
	bitauto.com
</I>
	and
<I>

</I>
</B>
	and
	12.0% respectively, of our total revenues. Our largest customer contributed approximately 5% of our total revenues in 2015. In addition, we generate revenue indirectly from these top customers in the form of performance-based rebates. When we place
	advertisements on behalf of our automaker customers, we typically receive performance-based rebates from third-party media vendors calculated as a percentage of the purchase price for qualifying advertising space purchased and utilized by our
	automaker customers. See &#147;&#151;Risks Related to Our Business and Industry&#151;We may not be able to continue to collect performance-based rebates for the advertisements we place on third-party websites, which is an important source of

	An important part of our digital marketing solutions business is to place
	advertisements on third-party websites on behalf of our automaker customers. Such media vendor websites often offer incentives in the form of performance-based rebates equal to a percentage of qualifying payments for advertising space purchased and
	utilized by our customers. Performance-based rebates are an important source of our revenues. In 2013, 2014 and 2015, income from performance-based rebates accounted for 5.5%, 7.5% and 6.8%, respectively, of our total revenues. Nonetheless, our
	ability to collect rebates from a media vendor website is contingent upon the total value of advertisements we place on such websites during a set time period and whether such value reaches the pre-determined thresholds. If we fail to reach the set
	threshold, we may not be able to continue to collect performance-based rebates at our expected levels, if at all. Under some media contracts for some customers, if we fail to reach the set minimum, we would lose not only part or all of the rebates,
	but also our performance security deposit. Some websites, in particular those with a large visitor base, may set the thresholds high or raise them from time to time and we may not be able to negotiate the rebate percentages or the threshold levels.
	Furthermore, media vendor websites may reduce the percentage of rebates or may not offer them at all. Our income from performance-based rebates may decrease or disappear, which could affect our financial condition and results of operations.

	There is an increasing trend of accessing the internet through devices other than a personal computer, such as

	our products and services from automakers and dealers. Demand for our products and services is particularly sensitive to changes in general economic conditions. Automakers and dealers typically cut their marketing expenditures during periods of
	economic downturn. In addition, purchases of new automobiles are often discretionary for consumers and have been, and may continue to be, affected by negative trends in the economy. Historically, unit sale of automobiles, particularly new
	automobiles, has been cyclical, fluctuating with general economic cycles. If China&#146;s automotive industry fails to expand or China&#146;s economy stagnates or contracts, our business, financial condition and results of operations would be
	materially and adversely affected.

	Government policies on automobile purchases and ownership may have a material effect on our business due to their influence on
	consumer behaviors. Since 2009, the PRC government has repeatedly changed the purchase tax on passenger automobiles with 1.6 liter or smaller engines. In addition, in August 2014, several PRC governmental authorities jointly announced that from
	September 2014 to December 2017, purchases of new energy automobiles that are within certain designated catalogues will be exempted from the purchase tax. In April 2015, several PRC governmental authorities also jointly announced that from 2016 to
	2020, purchasers of new energy automobiles that are within certain designated catalogues will enjoy subsidies. We cannot predict whether government subsidies will remain in the future or whether similar incentives will be introduced, and if they
	are, their impact on automobile sales in China. It is possible that automobile sales may decline significantly upon expiration of the existing government subsidies if consumers have become used to such incentives and delay purchase decisions in the
	absence of new incentives. If automobile sales indeed decline, our revenues may fluctuate and our results of operations may be materially and adversely affected.

	Some local governmental authorities also issued regulations and relevant implementation rules in order to control traffic and reduce the
	number of automobiles. For example, local Beijing governmental authorities adopted regulations and relevant implementing rules in December 2010 to limit the total number of license plates issued to new automobile purchases in Beijing each year. The
	implementing rules were amended in December 2011 and November 2013. Local Guangzhou governmental authorities also announced similar regulations, which came into effect in July 2013. There are similar policies that restrict the issuance of new
	passenger car license plates in Shanghai, Tianjin, Hangzhou, Guiyang and Shenzhen. In September 2013, the State Council released a plan for the prevention and remediation of air pollution, which requires large cities, such as Beijing, Shanghai and
	Guangzhou, to further restrict the number of motor vehicles. In October 2013, the Beijing government issued an additional regulation to limit the total number of vehicles in Beijing to no more than six million by the end of 2017. Such regulatory
	developments, as well as other uncertainties, may adversely affect the growth prospects of China&#146;s automotive industry, which in turn may have a material adverse impact on our business due to our reliance on the performance of automakers and
	automobile dealers.

	Any actual or perceived threat of a financial
	crisis in China, in particular a credit and banking crisis, could have an indirect, but material and adverse impact on our business and results of operations. It is unclear whether the Chinese economy will continue to experience the high growth rate
	in the past. There is considerable uncertainty over the long-term effects of the expansionary monetary and fiscal policies that have been adopted by the central banks and financial authorities of some of the world&#146;s leading economies, including
	the United States. The global financial markets are facing new challenges, including the escalation of the European sovereign debt crisis since 2011, the hostilities in the Ukraine and the Middle East, the end of quantitative easing by the U.S.
	Federal Reserve and the economic slowdown in the Eurozone in 2014. Economic conditions in China are sensitive to global economic conditions, as well as changes in domestic economic and political policies and the expected or perceived overall
	economic growth rate in China. It is impossible to predict how the Chinese economy would develop in the future.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:8%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	There have been recently
	signs that the rate of China&#146;s economic growth is declining. Any prolonged slowdown in China&#146;s economic development might lead to tighter credit markets, increased market volatility, sudden drops in business and consumer confidence and
	dramatic changes in business and consumer behaviors. In response to their perceived uncertainty in economic conditions, consumers might delay, reduce or cancel purchases of automobiles, which to some extent are considered as luxury items by many
	people in China, and our customers may also defer, reduce or cancel purchasing our services. To the extent any fluctuations in the Chinese economy significantly affect automakers&#146; and dealers&#146; demand for our services or change their
	spending habits, our results of operations may be materially and adversely affected.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:8%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	In addition, an economic downturn may reduce the
	number of automakers and dealers in China and decrease the demand for our services. We depend on automakers and dealers for business. Continued economic growth in China expanded the network of automakers and dealers, which is the primary source of
	our customers. Since the early 1990s, many non-automotive enterprises joined China&#146;s automotive industry and started offering new lines of automobiles. An increasing number of foreign brands gradually entered the PRC market primarily by forming
	joint ventures with Chinese brands. Growing automobile production capacity and production volume have significantly increased the number of dealers. By contrast, negative economic trends could lead to consolidations among automakers and dealers, and
	in effect shrink our customer base. Production lines might be contracted or shut down. A reduction in the number of automakers and dealers would reduce the number of opportunities we have to sell our products and services. To the extent that the
	automakers and dealers have used our products or services, consolidations may result in purchase cancellation of those product or service offerings. Any decrease in demand for our products and services could materially and adversely affect our
	ability to generate revenues, which in turn could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. Lastly, with respect to our online automotive financial platform services, a significant general economic downturn may increase our
	credit risk exposure if the financial position of our customers are severely and adversely affected. Although most of our financial leases are secured by the automobiles, foreclosures may be costly and time consuming and if those automobiles lose
	values dramatically, we may not be able to recover the full loan amount by foreclosures.

	We have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, seasonal fluctuations in our revenues and results of
	operations. Historically, our revenues tend to be lower in the first half and higher in the second half of each year. Advertising and promotional activities often increase in the second half of each year. New automobile models tend to be introduced
	in the last quarter, which usually leads to increases in advertising spending by automakers. Furthermore, some of our customers whose fiscal year ends with the calendar year often choose to take advantage of the last opportunities to increase their
	annual revenues before the year ends. In comparison, activity levels tend to decrease after the fourth quarter&#146;s spending. Our customers and automobile consumers may not yet have a set plan for the new fiscal year. Further, the holiday period
	following the Chinese New Year is usually in the first quarter, which may contribute to the lower activity levels in the first half of each year. Therefore, the seasonality of the automobile retail business and the resulting spending pattern of
	automakers and dealers may result in greater emphasis on the importance of our fourth quarter results.

	Nonetheless, if conditions arise
	in the second half of a year that depress or affect automobile sales and marketing spending by our customers, such as depressed economic conditions or similar situations, our revenues for the year may be disproportionately and adversely affected. As
	a result of these factors, our revenues may vary from quarter to quarter and our quarterly results may not be comparable to the corresponding periods of prior years. Our actual results may differ significantly from our targets or estimated quarterly
	results. Therefore, you may not be able to predict our annual operating results based on a quarter-to-quarter comparison of our operating results. We expect quarterly fluctuations in our revenues and results of operations to continue. These
	fluctuations could result in volatility and cause the price of our ADSs to fall. As our revenues grow, these seasonal fluctuations may become more pronounced.

	As part of our business strategy, we regularly evaluate
	investments in, or acquisitions of, complementary businesses, joint ventures, services and technologies, and we expect that periodically we will continue to make such investments and acquisitions in the future. For example, in 2013, we formed a
	joint venture with Kelley Blue Book, or KBB, a leading provider of new and used car information in the United States, and the China Automobile Dealers Association, or CADA, a national organization representing automobile dealers in China. In January
	2015, we entered into agreements to form strategic partnership with JD.com, Inc., or JD.com, the leading online direct sales company in China listed on the Nasdaq Global Select Market, and Tencent Holdings Limited, or Tencent, a leading provider of
	comprehensive Internet services and listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. In February 2015, JD.com and Tencent made investments in us with a combination of&nbsp;US$550 million in cash and certain resources, and investments totaling US$250 million
	in cash in Yixin Capital Limited, or Yixin Capital, a subsidiary of Bitauto primarily engaged in e-commerce-related automotive financial platform business. In addition, we made certain investments in some private companies in 2015, a majority of
	which are in auto and auto-related industries.

	Our operations are vulnerable to interruption and damage from natural and other types of catastrophes, including earthquakes, fire, floods,
	hail, windstorms, severe winter weather (including snow, freezing water, ice storms and blizzards), environmental accidents, power loss, communications failures, explosions, man-made events such as terrorist attacks, and similar events. Due to their
	nature, we cannot predict the incidence, timing and severity of catastrophes. In addition, changing climate conditions, primarily rising global temperatures, may be increasing, or may in the future increase, the frequency and severity of natural
	catastrophes. If any such catastrophe or extraordinary event were to occur in the future, our ability to operate our business could be seriously impaired. Such events could make it difficult or impossible for us to deliver our services to our
	customers and could decrease demand for our services. Although we are headquartered in Beijing, as of December 31, 2015, our sales and service representatives network covered 186 cities throughout China, exposing us to potential catastrophes of all
	types in a broad geographic area in China. Because our property insurance only covers property damages caused by a limited number of numerated natural disasters and accidents and significant time could be required to resume our operations, our
	financial position and operating results could be materially and adversely affected in the event of any major catastrophic event.

	In

	new virus subtype H7N9, commonly known as &#147;bird flu&#148; or &#147;avian flu,&#148; was discovered in eastern China and has already sickened and killed some people. It is unclear how this virus will spread, which makes it difficult to predict
	its potential impact. Any occurrence of these pandemic diseases or other adverse public health developments in China could severely disrupt our staffing and otherwise reduce the activity levels of our work force, causing a material and adverse

	The insurance industry in China is still at an early stage of development. Insurance companies in
	China offer limited business insurance products and are, to our knowledge, not well-developed in the field of business liability insurance. While business disruption insurance is available to a limited extent in China, we have determined that the
	risks of disruption, cost of such insurance and the difficulties associated with acquiring such insurance on commercially reasonable terms make it impractical for us to have such insurance. As a result, except for property insurance and automobile
	insurance, we do not have any business liability, disruption or litigation insurance coverage for our operations in China. Any business disruption or litigation may result in our incurring substantial costs and diversion of resources.

	In December 2012, the
	SEC brought administrative proceedings against five accounting firms in China, including our independent registered public accounting firm, alleging that they had refused to produce audit work papers and other documents related to certain other
	China-based companies under investigation by the SEC. On January 22, 2014, an initial administrative law decision was issued, censuring these accounting firms and suspending four of these firms from practicing before the SEC for a period of six
	months. The decision is neither final nor legally effective unless and until reviewed and approved by the SEC. On February 12, 2014, four of these PRC-based accounting firms appealed to the SEC against this decision. In February 2015, each of the
	four PRC-based accounting firms agreed to a censure and to pay a fine to the SEC to settle the dispute and avoid suspension of their ability to practice before the SEC. The settlement requires the firms to follow detailed procedures to seek to
	provide the SEC with access to Chinese firms&#146; audit documents via the China Securities Regulatory Commission, or the CSRC. If the firms do not follow these procedures, the SEC could impose penalties such as suspensions, or it could restart the
	administrative proceedings.

	In the event that the SEC restarts the administrative proceedings, depending upon the final outcome, listed
	companies in the United States with major PRC operations may find it difficult or impossible to retain auditors in respect of their operations in the PRC, which could result in financial statements being determined to not be in compliance with the
	requirements of the Exchange Act, including possible delisting. Moreover, any negative news about the proceedings against these audit firms may cause investor uncertainty regarding China-based, United States-listed companies and the market price of

	If our independent registered public accounting firm was denied, even temporarily, the ability to

	of the Exchange Act. Such a determination could ultimately lead to the delay or abandonment of this offering, delisting of our ordinary shares from the New York Stock Exchange or deregistration from the SEC, or both, which would substantially reduce

	The independent registered public accounting firm that issues the audit reports included in this annual report, as an auditor of companies
	that are traded publicly in the United States and a firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), or PCAOB, is required by the laws of the United States to undergo regular inspections by the PCAOB to assess its
	compliance with the laws of the United States and with applicable professional standards. Because our auditor is located in China, a jurisdiction where the PCAOB is currently unable to conduct inspections without the approval of the PRC authorities,
	our auditor, like other independent registered public accounting firms operating in China, is currently not inspected by the PCAOB. In May 2013, PCAOB announced that it had entered into a Memorandum of Understanding on Enforcement Cooperation with
	the CSRC and the Ministry of Finance, which establishes a cooperative framework between the parties for the production and exchange of audit documents relevant to investigations undertaken by PCAOB, the China Securities Regulatory Commission, or the
	CSRC, or the Ministry of Finance in the United States and the PRC, respectively. PCAOB continues to be in discussions with the CSRC and the Ministry of Finance to permit joint inspections in the PRC of audit firms that are registered with PCAOB and

	Inspections of other firms that the PCAOB has conducted outside of China have
	identified deficiencies in those firms&#146; audit procedures and quality control procedures, and such deficiencies may be addressed as part of the inspection process to improve future audit quality. The inability of the PCAOB to conduct inspections
	of independent registered public accounting firms operating in China makes it more difficult to evaluate the effectiveness of our auditor&#146;s audit procedures or quality control procedures, and to the extent that such inspections might have
	facilitated improvements in our auditor&#146;s audit procedures and quality control procedures, investors may be deprived of such benefits.

	Furthermore, on

	reiterates certain provisions under China&#146;s Administrative Rules on Foreign-Invested Telecommunications Enterprises. Among other things, the MIIT Notice prohibits domestic telecommunications license holders from (i) renting, transferring or
	selling telecommunications licenses to any foreign investors in any form and (ii) from providing any assistance, including providing resources, sites or facilities, to foreign investors that conduct value-added telecommunications business illegally
	in China. Under the MIIT Notice, holders of valued-added telecommunications business operating licenses, or their shareholders, must directly own the domain names and registered trademarks used by such license holders in their daily operations.
	BBIT&#146;s internet information services are considered value-added telecommunication services set forth in the MIIT Notice and BBIT owns an ICP license, for its provision of internet information service and all the trademarks used for its internet
	information services on its websites. Since there is currently no official interpretation or implementation practice under the MIIT Notice, it remains uncertain how the MIIT Notice will be enforced and whether or to what extent the MIIT Notice may

	Although we have been advised by our PRC counsel that, each of the contractual arrangements with our structured entities are valid under
	current PRC laws, these contractual arrangements may not be as effective in providing us with control over the structured entities as ownership of controlling equity interests would be in providing us with control over, or enabling us to derive
	economic benefits from the operations of, the structured entities. If we had direct ownership of the structured entities, we would be able to exercise our rights as a shareholder to (i) effect changes in the board of directors of those entities,
	which in turn could effect changes, subject to any applicable fiduciary obligations, at the management level, and (ii) derive economic benefits from the operations of the structured entities by causing them to declare and pay dividends. However,
	under the current contractual arrangements, as a legal matter, if any of the structured entities or any of their shareholders fails to perform its, his or her respective obligations under these contractual arrangements, we may have to incur
	substantial costs and resources to enforce such arrangements, and rely on legal remedies available under PRC laws, including seeking specific performance or injunctive relief, and claiming damages, which we cannot assure you will be effective. For

	Mr. Li and Mr. Qu each only hold a minority interest in us. The fiduciary duty implied from their roles as our directors and executive officers is not fully aligned with their interests as shareholders of our structured entities. These individuals
	may breach or cause the structured entities that they beneficially own to breach or refuse to renew the existing contractual arrangements, which will have a material adverse effect on our ability to effectively control the structured entities and

	Among other things, the draft Foreign Investment Law expands the

	provides that an entity established in China but &#147;controlled&#148; by foreign investors will be treated as a foreign investor, whereas an entity set up in a foreign jurisdiction would nonetheless be, upon market entry clearance by the MOC or
	its local branches, treated as a PRC domestic investor provided that the entity is &#147;controlled&#148; by PRC entities and/or citizens. In this connection, &#147;control&#148; is broadly defined in the draft law to cover, among others, having the
	power to exert decisive influence, via contractual or trust arrangements, over the subject entity&#146;s operations, financial matters or other key aspects of business operations. If the foreign investment falls within a &#147;negative list,&#148;
	to be separately issued by the State Council in the future, market entry clearance by the MOC or its local branches would be required. Otherwise, all foreign investors may make investments on the same terms as Chinese investors without being subject

	We conduct our business primarily through our subsidiaries and structured entities in China. Our operations in China are governed by PRC laws
	and regulations. The PRC legal system is a civil law system based on written statutes. Unlike in the common law system, prior court decisions may be cited for reference but have limited precedential value. Since 1979, PRC legislation and regulations
	have significantly enhanced the protections afforded to various forms of foreign investments in China. We conduct all of our business through our subsidiaries and structured entities established in China. However, since the PRC legal system

	Under the currently applicable foreign exchange regulations, PRC resident shareholders must amend

	The conversion of Renminbi into foreign currencies, including U.S. dollars, is based on rates set
	by the People&#146;s Bank of China. The PRC government allowed the Renminbi to appreciate by more than 20% against the U.S. dollar between July 2005 and July 2008. Between July 2008 and June 2010, this appreciation halted and the exchange rate
	between the RMB and the U.S. dollar remained within a narrow band. After June&nbsp;2010, the RMB began to appreciate against the U.S. dollar again, although there have been some periods when it has lost value against the U.S. dollar, as it did for
	example during 2014. The RMB depreciated by 4.22% against the U.S. dollar in 2015. It is difficult to predict how market forces or PRC or U.S. government policy may impact the exchange rate between the RMB and the U.S. dollar in the future.

	the purpose of making payments for dividends on our ordinary shares or ADSs or for other business purposes, appreciation of the U.S. dollar against the Renminbi would have a negative effect on the U.S. dollar amount available to us. In addition,
	since the functional currency of our holding company, Bitauto Holdings Limited, is the U.S. dollar while the functional currency of our PRC subsidiaries and PRC structured entities is the Renminbi, appreciation or depreciation in the value of the

	On August 8, 2006, six PRC regulatory agencies, including the CSRC, promulgated the Regulations on Mergers and Acquisitions of Domestic
	Companies by Foreign Investors, or the M&amp;A Rules, which became effective on September 8, 2006 and was amended on June 22, 2009. Among other things, the M&amp;A Rules and recently issued regulations and rules concerning mergers and acquisitions
	established additional procedures and requirements that could make merger and acquisition activities by foreign investors more time-consuming and complex. For example, the M&amp;A Rules require that the Ministry of Commerce be notified in advance of
	any change-of-control transaction in which a foreign investor takes control of a PRC domestic enterprise or a foreign company with substantial PRC operations, if certain thresholds under the Provisions on Thresholds for Prior Notification of
	Concentrations of Undertakings, issued by the State Council on August 3, 2008, are triggered. According to the Implementing Rules Concerning Security Review on the Mergers and Acquisitions by Foreign Investors of Domestic Enterprises issued by the
	Ministry of Commerce in August 2011, mergers and acquisitions by foreign investors involved in an industry related to national security are subject to strict review by the Ministry of Commerce. These rules also prohibit any transactions attempting
	to bypass such security review, including by controlling entities through contractual arrangements. We believe that our business is not in an industry related to national security. However, we cannot preclude the possibility that the Ministry of
	Commerce or other government agencies may publish interpretations contrary to our understanding or broaden the scope of such security review in the future. Although we have no current plans to make any acquisitions, we may elect to grow our business
	in the future in part by directly acquiring complementary businesses in China. Complying with the requirements of these regulations to complete such transactions could be time-consuming, and any required approval processes, including obtaining

	As an offshore holding company of our PRC subsidiaries, we may make loans to our PRC subsidiaries

	loans by us to our subsidiaries cannot exceed statutory limits and must be registered with SAFE, or its local branch. Besides SAFE registration, loans to structured entities may also need government approval. Capital contributions to our PRC
	subsidiaries must be approved by the PRC Ministry of Commerce or its local counterpart. In addition, the PRC government also restricts the convertibility of foreign currencies into Renminbi and use of the proceeds. On August 29, 2008, the State
	Administration of Foreign Exchange, or SAFE, promulgated Circular 142, a notice regulating the conversion by a foreign-invested company of foreign currency into Renminbi by restricting how the converted Renminbi may be used. The circular requires
	that Renminbi converted from the foreign currency-denominated capital of a foreign-invested company may only be used for purposes within the business scope approved by the applicable governmental authority and may not be used for equity investments
	in the PRC unless otherwise provided by laws and regulations. In addition, SAFE strengthened its oversight of the flow and use of Renminbi funds converted from the foreign currency denominated capital of a foreign-invested company. The use of such
	Renminbi may not be changed without approval from SAFE, and may not be used to repay Renminbi loans if the proceeds of such loans have not yet been used for purposes within the company&#146;s approved business scope. On March 30, 2015, the SAFE
	promulgated Circular 19, which took effect and replaced Circular 142 from June 1, 2015. Although Circular 19 allows for the use of RMB converted from the foreign currency-denominated capital for equity investments in the PRC, the restrictions will
	continue to apply as to foreign-invested enterprises&#146; use of the converted RMB for purposes beyond the business scope, for entrusted loans or for inter-company RMB loans. Violations of the applicable circulars and rules may result in severe
	penalties, including substantial fines as set forth in the Foreign Exchange Administration Regulations. If our structured entities require financial support from us or our wholly owned subsidiaries in the future and we find it necessary to use
	foreign currency-denominated capital to provide such financial support, our ability to fund our structured entities&#146; operations will be subject to statutory limits and restrictions, including those described above.

	The PRC

	the Enforcement of Dividend Provisions in Tax Treaties, if the relevant PRC tax authorities determine, in their discretion, that a company benefits from such reduced income tax rate due to a structure or arrangement that is primarily tax-driven,
	such PRC tax authorities may adjust the preferential tax treatment; and based on the Notice on the Comprehension and Recognition of Beneficial Owner in Tax Treaties issued on October 27, 2009 by the State Administration of Taxation, conduit
	companies, which are established for the purpose of evading or reducing tax, transferring or accumulating profits, shall not be recognized as beneficial owner and thus are not entitled to the abovementioned reduced income tax rate of 5% under the

	from reduced income tax rate due to a structure or arrangement that is primarily tax-driven, it would materially and adversely affect the amount of dividends, if any, we may pay to our shareholders and ADS holders.

	Under
	the EIT Law, an enterprise established outside of China with &#147;de facto management body&#148; within China is considered a &#147;resident enterprise,&#148; meaning that it can be treated in a manner similar to a Chinese enterprise for enterprise
	income tax purposes. The implementing rules of the EIT Law define &#147;de facto management body&#148; as &#147;substantial and overall management and control over the production and operations, personnel, accounting, and properties&#148; of the
	enterprise. On April 22, 2009, the State Administration of Taxation, or the SAT, issued a circular, or SAT Circular 82, which provides certain specific criteria for determining whether the &#147;de facto management body&#148; of a PRC-controlled
	enterprise that is incorporated offshore is located in China. In addition, a bulletin issued by the SAT issued on July 27, 2011, which became effective September 1, 2011, provided more guidance on the implementation of Circular 82. This bulletin
	clarifies matters including resident status determination, post-determination administration and competent tax authorities. Although the SAT Circular 82 and the bulletin only apply to offshore enterprises controlled by PRC enterprises or PRC
	enterprise groups, not those controlled by PRC individuals or foreigners, the determining criteria set forth in the SAT Circular 82 may reflect the SAT&#146;s general position on how the &#147;de facto management body&#148; text should be applied in
	determining the tax resident status of all offshore enterprises, regardless of whether they are controlled by PRC enterprises or individuals.

	Although we do not believe that our legal entities organized outside of the PRC constitute PRC
	resident enterprises, it is possible that the PRC tax authorities could reach a different conclusion. If the PRC tax authorities determine that our Cayman Islands company is a &#147;resident enterprise&#148; for PRC enterprise income tax purposes, a
	number of PRC tax consequences could follow. First, we may be subject to the enterprise income tax at a rate of 25% on our worldwide taxable income as well as PRC enterprise income tax reporting obligations; in our case, this would mean that income
	such as interest on our public offering proceeds and other income sourced from outside the PRC would be subject to PRC enterprise income tax at a rate of 25%. Second, the EIT Law provides that dividends paid between &#147;qualified resident
	enterprises&#148; are exempt from enterprise income tax. It is unclear whether the dividends we receive from BBII will constitute dividends between &#147;qualified resident enterprises&#148; and would therefore qualify for tax exemption, because the
	definition of qualified resident enterprises is unclear and the relevant PRC government authorities have not yet issued guidance with respect to the processing of outbound remittances to entities that are treated as resident enterprises for PRC
	enterprise income tax purposes. Third, dividends payable by us to our non-PRC resident enterprise investors and gains on the sale of shares by such non-PRC resident enterprise investors may be subject to PRC enterprise income tax at a rate of 10%
	and such dividends and gains earned by non-PRC resident individual investors may be subject to PRC individual income tax at a rate of 20%. It is unclear whether, if we were considered a PRC resident enterprise, our non-resident investors would be
	able to claim the benefit of income tax treaties or agreements entered into between China and other countries or regions.

	for the 50% reduction of the preferential tax rate for &#147;high and new technology enterprises strongly supported by the state&#148; of 15%. Therefore, the income tax rate applicable for BBII was 7.5% for the years ended 2009, 2010 and 2011. In

	indirectly by disposition of the equity interests of an overseas holding company, or an Indirect Transfer, the non-resident enterprise, being the transferor, may be subject to PRC enterprise income tax, if the Indirect Transfer is considered as an

	Public Notice 7 also interprets the term &#147;transfer of the equity interest in a foreign intermediate holding company&#148; broadly. In addition, Public Notice 7 further clarifies certain criteria on how to assess reasonable commercial purposes
	and introduces safe harbor scenarios applicable to internal group restructurings. However, it also imposes burdens on both the foreign transferor and the transferee of the Indirect Transfer as they are required to make a self-assessment on whether
	the transaction should be subject to PRC tax and whether to file or withhold the PRC tax accordingly.

	Public Notice 7 and its
	interpretation by relevant PRC authorities clarify that an exemption provided by Circular 698 for transfers of shares in a publicly-traded entity that is listed overseas is available if the purchase of the shares and the sale of the shares both take
	place in open-market transactions. However, if a shareholder of an entity that is listed overseas purchases shares in the open market and sells them in a private transaction, or vice versa, PRC tax authorities might deem such a transfer to be
	subject to Circular 698 and Public Notice 7, which could subject such shareholder to additional reporting obligations or tax burdens. Accordingly, if a holder of our ADSs or ordinary shares purchases our ADSs or ordinary shares in the open market
	and sells them in a private transaction, or vice-versa, and fails to comply with Circular 698 or Public Notice 7, the PRC tax authorities may take actions, including requesting us to provide assistance for their investigation or impose a penalty on
	us, which could have a negative impact on our business operations. In addition, since we may pursue acquisitions as one of our growth strategies, and may conduct acquisitions involving complex corporate structures, PRC tax authorities might impose
	taxes on capital gains or request that we submit additional documentation for their review in connection with any potential acquisitions, which may cause us to incur additional acquisition costs or delay our acquisition timetable.

	The PRC tax authorities have discretion under SAT Circular 59, Circular 698 and Public Notice 7 to make adjustments to the taxable capital

	under the PRC Enterprise Income Tax Law and if the PRC tax authorities make adjustments to the taxable income of these transactions under SAT Circular 59, Circular 698 or Public Notice 7, our income tax expenses associated with such potential

	Our corporate affairs are governed by our memorandum and articles of association, as amended and restated from time to time, and by the

	the common law of the Cayman Islands. The common law of the Cayman Islands is derived in part from comparatively limited judicial precedent in the Cayman Islands as well as from English common law, which provides persuasive, but not binding,
	authority on a court in the Cayman Islands. The rights of our shareholders and the fiduciary responsibilities of our directors under Cayman Islands law are not as clearly established as they would be under statutes or judicial precedents in the

	owned by us for U.S. federal income tax purposes, not only because we exercise effective control over the operation of such entities but also because we are entitled to substantially all of their economic benefits, and, as a result, we consolidate
	their results of operations in our consolidated financial statements. If it were determined, however, that we are not the owner of our PRC structured entities for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we would likely be treated as a PFIC.

	Assuming we are the owner of our PRC structured entities for U.S. federal income tax purposes, and based on our income, assets, and the market
	price of our ADSs, we do not believe that we were a PFIC for the taxable year ended December 31, 2015. However, there is a significant risk that we will be a PFIC for our taxable year ending December 31, 2016, and future taxable years unless the
	market price of our ADSs increases and/or we invest a substantial amount of cash and other passive assets we hold in assets that produce or are held for the production of non-passive income Because the determination of whether we will be or become a
	PFIC is a fact-intensive inquiry made on an annual basis that depends, in part, on the composition of our income and assets, no assurance can be given with respect to our PFIC status for any taxable year. Fluctuations in the market price of our ADSs
	may cause us to become a PFIC for the current or subsequent taxable years because the value of assets for the purpose of the asset test, including the value of our goodwill and unbooked intangibles, may be determined by reference to the market price
	of our ADSs from time to time (which may be volatile). Furthermore, the composition of our income and assets may also be affected by how, and how quickly, we use our liquid assets. Under circumstances where our revenue from activities that produce
	passive income significantly increase relative to our revenue from activities that produce non-passive income, or where we determine not to deploy significant amounts of cash for active purposes, our risk of becoming classified as a PFIC may
	substantially increase. In addition, because there are uncertainties in the application of the relevant rules, it is also possible that the Internal Revenue Service may challenge our classification of certain income and assets as non-passive, which
	may result in our company being or becoming classified as a PFIC for the current year or future taxable years.

	gain recognized on the sale or other disposition of the ADSs or ordinary shares and on the receipt of distributions on the ADSs or ordinary shares to the extent such distribution is treated as an &#147;excess distribution&#148; under U.S. federal
	income tax rules. Further, if we are classified as a PFIC for any year during which a U.S. Holder holds our ADSs or ordinary shares, we generally will continue to be treated as a PFIC for all succeeding years during which such U.S. Holder holds our
	ADSs or ordinary shares. We urge you to consult your tax advisor concerning the U.S. federal income tax consequences of holding and disposing of ADSs or ordinary shares if we are classified as a PFIC. For more information, see &#147;Item 10.

	In addition to Section 404, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act also mandates, among other things, that
	companies adopt corporate governance measures, imposes comprehensive reporting and disclosure requirements, sets strict independence and financial expertise standards for audit committee members, and imposes civil and criminal penalties for
	companies, their chief executive officers, chief financial officers and directors for securities law violations. For example, in response to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the NYSE has adopted additional comprehensive rules and regulations relating to

	Our customers consist

	dispersed and smaller in size as compared to automakers. Our EP platform and applications on our taoche.com website have a diverse customer base. No single dealer accounts for a material portion of our revenues, while revenues from automaker
	customers are generally more concentrated due to the relatively small number of automaker customers and the large amounts of their contracts with us. In 2013, 2014 and 2015, revenues from the top three customers in each period accounted for
	approximately
<B>
</B>
	12.2%, 8.6% and 12.0%, respectively, of our total revenues. Our largest customer accounted for approximately 5% of our total revenues in 2015. In addition, we also generate revenues indirectly from our automaker customers in the
	form of performance-based rebates. When we place advertisements on behalf of our automaker customers, we usually receive performance-based rebates from media vendors, which equal a percentage of the purchase price for qualifying&nbsp;advertising

	In addition, the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology has published regulations that subject website operators to potential liability for content displayed on their websites and the actions of users and others using their systems,
	including liability for violations of PRC laws and regulations prohibiting the dissemination of content deemed to be socially destabilizing. The Ministry of Public Security has the authority to order any local internet service provider to block any

	effective on January 1, 2008 and was amended on December 28, 2012, permit workers in both state-owned and private enterprises in China to bargain collectively. The National Labor Law and the National Labor Contract Law provide for collective

	PRC Enterprise Income Tax Law
</B>
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:8%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	On March 16, 2007, China passed a new Enterprise Income Tax Law, or the EIT Law, and its implementing rules, both of which became effective on
	January 1, 2008. Under the EIT Law, enterprises are classified as resident enterprises and non-resident enterprises. PRC resident enterprises typically pay an enterprise income tax at the rate of 25% and enterprises identified as key
	high-and-new-technology enterprises supported by the state enjoy a preferential enterprise income tax rate of 15%. An enterprise established outside of China with its &#147;de facto management bodies&#148; located within China is considered a
	&#147;resident enterprise,&#148; meaning that it can be treated in a manner similar to a Chinese domestic enterprise for enterprise income tax purposes. The implementing rules of the EIT Law define de facto management body as a managing body that in
	practice exercises &#147;substantial and overall management and control over the production and operations, personnel, accounting, and properties&#148; of the enterprise.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:8%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The SAT issued the Notice Regarding the Determination of Chinese-Controlled Offshore Incorporated Enterprises as PRC Tax Resident Enterprises
	on the Basis of De Facto Management Bodies, or Circular 82, on April 22, 2009. Circular 82 provides certain specific criteria for determining whether the &#147;de facto management body&#148; of a PRC-controlled offshore incorporated enterprise is
	located in China, which include all of the following conditions: (a) the location where senior management members responsible for an enterprise&#146;s daily operations discharge their duties; (b) the location where financial and human resource
	decisions are made or approved by organizations or persons; (c) the location where the major assets and corporate documents are kept; and (d) the location where more than half (inclusive) of all directors with voting rights or senior management have
	their habitual residence. In addition, the SAT issued a bulletin on July 27, 2011, effective September 1, 2011, and as amended on June 1, 2015, providing more guidance on the implementation of Circular 82. This bulletin clarifies matters including
	resident status determination, post-determination administration and competent tax authorities. Although both Circular 82 and the bulletin only apply to offshore enterprises controlled by PRC enterprises or PRC enterprise groups, not those
	controlled by PRC individuals or foreign individuals, the determining criteria set forth in Circular 82 and the bulletin may reflect the SAT&#146;s general position on how the &#147;de facto management body&#148; test should be applied in
	determining the tax resident status of offshore enterprises, regardless of whether they are controlled by PRC enterprises or PRC enterprise groups or by PRC or foreign individuals.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:8%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Due to the short history of the EIT law and lack of applicable legal precedents, it remains unclear how the PRC tax authorities will determine
	the PRC tax resident treatment of a foreign company such as us. If the PRC tax authorities determine that we are a &#147;resident enterprise&#148; for PRC enterprise income tax purposes, a number of PRC tax consequences could follow. First, we may
	be subject to the enterprise income tax at a rate of 25% on our worldwide taxable income as well as PRC enterprise income tax reporting obligations; second, the EIT Law provides that dividends paid between &#147;qualified resident enterprises&#148;
	are exempt from enterprise income tax. However, it is unclear whether the dividends our holding companies receive from BBII will constitute dividends between &#147;qualified resident enterprises&#148; and would therefore qualify for tax exemption,
	because the definition of qualified resident enterprises is unclear and the relevant PRC government authorities have not yet issued guidance with respect to the processing of outbound remittances to entities that are treated as resident enterprises
	for PRC enterprise income tax purposes; third, if the competent PRC tax authorities consider dividends we pay with respect to our ADSs or ordinary shares and the gains realized from the transfer of our ADSs or ordinary shares income derived from
	sources within the PRC, such dividends and gains earned by our non-PRC resident enterprise investors may be subject to PRC enterprise income tax at a rate of 10% and such dividends and gains earned by non-PRC resident individuals may be subject to
	PRC individual income tax at a rate of 20%. In addition, it is unclear whether, if we were considered a PRC resident enterprise, our non-resident investors would be able to claim the benefit of income tax treaties or agreements entered into between
	China and other countries or regions.

	The EIT Law and the implementation rules provide that an income tax rate of 10% will normally be
	applicable to dividends payable to investors that are &#147;non-resident enterprises,&#148; or non-resident investors, which (i) do not have an establishment or place of business in the PRC or (ii) have an establishment or place of business in the
	PRC, but the relevant income is not effectively connected with the establishment or place of business to the extent such dividends are derived from sources within the PRC. The State Council of the PRC or a tax treaty between China and the
	jurisdictions in which the non-PRC investors reside may reduce such income tax. Pursuant to the Double Tax Avoidance Arrangement between Hong Kong and Mainland China and the Notice on Certain Issues with Respect to the Enforcement of Dividend
	Provisions in Tax Treaties issued on February 20, 2009 by the State Administration of Taxation, if the Hong Kong resident enterprise owns more than 25% of the equity interest in a company in China within 12 months immediately prior to obtaining
	dividends from such company and is determined by the competent PRC tax authority to have satisfied other conditions and requirements under the Double Tax Avoidance Arrangement between Hong Kong and Mainland China and other applicable PRC laws, the
	10% withholding tax on the dividends the Hong Kong resident enterprise received from such company in China is reduced to 5%. In August 2015, the State Administration of Taxation promulgated the Administrative Measures for Non-Resident Taxpayers to
	Enjoy Treatments under Tax Treaties, or Circular 60, which became effective on November 1, 2015. Circular 60 provides that non-resident enterprises are not required to obtain pre-approval from the relevant tax authority in order to enjoy the reduced
	withholding tax rate. Instead, non-resident enterprises and their withholding agents may, by self-assessment and on confirmation that the prescribed criteria to enjoy the tax treaty benefits are met, directly apply the reduced withholding tax rate,
	and file necessary forms and supporting documents when performing tax filings, which will be subject to post-tax filing examinations by the relevant tax authorities. Accordingly, our Hong Kong subsidiary may be able to enjoy the 5% withholding tax
	rate for the dividends they receive from our PRC subsidiaries, if it satisfies the conditions prescribed under Double the Tax Avoidance Arrangement and other relevant tax rules and regulations. However, based on the Notice on Certain Issues with
	Respect to the Enforcement of Dividend Provisions in Tax Treaties, if the relevant PRC tax authorities determine, in their discretion, that a company benefits from such reduced income tax rate due to a structure or arrangement that is primarily
	tax-driven, such PRC tax authorities may adjust the preferential tax treatment; and based on the Notice on the Comprehension and Recognition of Beneficial Owner in Tax Treaties issued on October 27, 2009 by the State Administration of Taxation,
	conduit companies, which are established for the purpose of evading or reducing tax, or transferring or accumulating profits, shall not be recognized as beneficial owners and thus are not entitled to the above-mentioned reduced income tax rate of 5%
	under the Double Tax Avoidance Arrangement.

	On April 30, 2009, the
	Ministry of Finance and the SAT jointly issued the Notice on Issues Concerning Process of Enterprise Income Tax in Enterprise Restructuring Business, or Circular 59. On December 10, 2009, the SAT issued Circular 698. Both Circular 59 and Circular
	698 became effective retroactively as of January 1, 2008. By promulgating and implementing these two circulars, the PRC tax authorities have enhanced their scrutiny over the direct or indirect transfer of equity interests in a PRC resident
	enterprise by a non-resident enterprise. Under Circular 698, where a non-resident enterprise transfers the equity interests of a PRC &#147;resident enterprise&#148; indirectly by disposing the equity interests of an overseas holding company, or an
	Indirect Transfer, and such overseas holding company is located in certain low tax jurisdictions, the non-resident enterprise, being the transferor, shall report the Indirect Transfer to the competent tax authority of the PRC &#147;resident
	enterprise.&#148; The PRC tax authority may disregard the existence of the overseas holding company if it lacks a reasonable commercial purpose and was established for the purpose of reducing, avoiding or deferring PRC tax. As a result, gains
	derived from such Indirect Transfer may be subject to PRC tax at a rate of up to 10%. On February 3, 2015, the SAT issued Public Notice 7 which extends its tax jurisdiction to capture not only Indirect Transfer as set forth under Circular 698 but
	also transactions involving the transfer of real property in China and assets of an establishment or a place in the PRC by a foreign company through the offshore transfer of a foreign intermediate holding company. Public Notice 7 interprets the term
	&#147;transfer of the equity interest in a foreign intermediate holding company&#148; broadly. In addition, Public Notice 7 further clarifies certain criteria on how to assess reasonable commercial purposes and introduces safe harbor scenarios
	applicable to internal group restructurings. However, it also imposes burdens on both the foreign transferor and the transferee of the Indirect Transfer as they are required to make a self-assessment on whether the transaction should be subject to
	PRC tax and whether to file or withhold the PRC tax accordingly. Circular 698 and Public Notice 7 may be determined by the tax authorities to be applicable to our future disposition of equity interests in certain non-resident holding companies that
	hold an equity interest in any of our PRC subsidiaries, if any of such transactions were determined by the tax authorities to lack reasonable commercial purpose. As a result, we may become at risk of being taxed under Circular 698 and Public Notice
	7 and may be required to expend valuable resources to comply with Circular 698 and Public Notice 7 or to establish that we should not be taxed under Circular 698 or Public Notice 7, which may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition
	and results of operations.

	Circular 157 was previously determined to be applicable to BBII in prior years and therefore, the applicable income tax
	rate was 10% and 11% for 2009 and 2010, respectively. In 2011, it was determined that BBII was not within the scope of Circular 157 and therefore, was eligible for the 50% reduction based on the preferential tax rate for &#147;high and new
	technology enterprises strongly supported by the state&#148; of 15%. Therefore, the applicable income tax rate was 7.5% for the years ended 2009, 2010 and 2011. In October 2011 and 2014, BBII successfully renewed its &#147;High and New Technology
	Enterprise&#148; status for another three years and will be able to enjoy a preferential income tax rate of 15% for the year ended December 31, 2016, as long as it maintains its qualification and continues to meet relevant requirements as a
	&#147;High and New Technology Enterprise.&#148; In December 2011, Beijing Bit EP Information Technology Company Limited, or Bit EP, was qualified as a &#147;software enterprise&#148; and will enjoy a two-year exemption from enterprise income tax
	followed by a three-year half reduction of enterprise income tax from the first fiscal year when Bit EP becomes profitable since December 2011. A notice issued by the relevant Beijing governmental authority in April 2013 requires enterprises
	established after January 1, 2011 with &#147;software enterprise&#148; qualification, like Bit EP, to re-apply for such qualification in accordance with requirements under the New Software Enterprise Measure issued by relevant PRC authority in
	February 2013. Bit EP obtained the &#147;software enterprise&#148; qualification under the New Software Enterprise Measures in May 2013. In December 2013, Target Net was qualified as a &#147;High and New Technology Enterprise&#148; under the EIT law
	and it will enjoy a preferential income tax rate of 15% for the year ended December 31, 2016 as long as Target Net maintains its qualification and continues to meet the relevant requirements as a &#147;High and New Technology Enterprise.&#148; In
	December 2014, Bitauto Xi&#146;an was qualified as a &#147;software enterprise&#148; and now enjoys a two-year exemption from enterprise income tax followed by a three-year half reduction of enterprise income tax from the first fiscal year when

	The M&amp;A Rule established additional procedures and requirements that could make merger and acquisition activities by foreign investors more
	time-consuming and complex. These rules require, among other things, that the Ministry of Commerce be notified in advance of any change-of-control transaction in which a foreign investor will take control of a PRC domestic enterprise or a foreign
	company with substantial PRC operations, if certain thresholds under the Provisions on Thresholds for Prior Notification of Concentrations of Undertakings issued by the State Council on August 3, 2008 are triggered. According to the Implementing
	Rules Concerning Security Review on the Mergers and Acquisitions by Foreign Investors of Domestic Enterprises issued by the Ministry of Commerce in August 2011, mergers and acquisitions by foreign investors involved in an industry related to
	national security are subject to strict review by the Ministry of Commerce. These rules also prohibit any transactions attempting to bypass such security review, including by controlling entities through contractual arrangements. We believe that our
	business is not in an industry related to national security. However, we cannot preclude the possibility that the Ministry of Commerce or other government agencies may publish interpretations contrary to our understanding or broaden the scope of
	such security review in the future. Although we have no current plans to make any acquisitions, we may elect to grow our business in the future in part by directly acquiring complementary businesses in China. Complying with these requirements could

	We are a leading provider of internet content and marketing services for China&#146;s fast-growing automotive industry. In 2015, our businesses
	were managed in three segments, namely, advertising business, EP platform business and digital marketing solutions business. Our advertising business offers a variety of advertising services mainly to automakers through our bitauto.com and
	taoche.com websites, as well as mobile applications, which provide consumers with comprehensive up-to-date automobile pricing and promotional information, specifications, reviews and consumer feedback. Our EP platform business provides web-based and
	mobile-based integrated digital marketing solutions in China. The platform enables dealer subscribers to create their own online showrooms, list pricing and promotional information, provide dealer contact information, place advertisements and manage
	customer relationships to help them reach a broad set of purchase-minded customers and effectively market their automobiles to consumers online. From 2014, we have started providing automobile customers with transaction services, including our
	automobile transactions, CRM and online automotive financial platform services, which are intended to optimize automobile purchase experience and facilitate completion of transactions. Our digital marketing solutions business provides automakers
	with one-stop digital marketing solutions, including website creation and maintenance, online public relations, online marketing campaigns and advertising agent services.

	Our business has experienced rapid growth in the past few years. As a result, we need to adjust
	our business segmentation to better present our results of operations. Prior to 2013, we managed businesses in three segments, namely, bitauto.com business, taoche.com business and digital marketing solutions business. From 2013 to 2014, our EP
	platform business was added as a new segment. Starting from the first quarter of 2015, our taoche.com business has been consolidated into our advertising business and EP platform business and is not reported as a separate segment. Revenues were
	RMB1.44 billion, RMB2.46 billion and RMB4.01 billion (US$619.3 million) in 2013, 2014 and 2015, respectively. In 2015, revenues from our advertising, EP platform and digital marketing solutions businesses accounted for 40.4%, 48.2% and 11.4% of our
	total revenues, respectively. Under IFRS, we had profits of RMB241.2 million, RMB489.1 million in 2013 and 2014, respectively, and loss of RMB416.5 million (US$64.3 million) in 2015.

<I>
	Development of China&#146;s automotive industry.
</I>
	We rely on China&#146;s automotive industry for substantially all of our revenues,
	which we generate from providing internet content and marketing services to automakers and dealers. We have greatly benefited from the rapid growth of China&#146;s automotive industry during the past few years. China&#146;s automotive industry is
	still at an early stage of development and remains subject to many uncertainties, including the general economic conditions in China and around the world, the growth of disposable household income and the availability and cost of credit available to
	finance automobile purchases, taxes and other incentives or disincentives related to automobile purchases and ownership, environmental concerns and measures taken to address these concerns, and cost of energy including gasoline price. We believe
	that the auto industry in China will face challenges, as government subsidies to promote auto sales are phased out and major cities such as Beijing introduce traffic control policies that will restrict new auto purchases. Adverse changes to the
	development of China&#146;s automotive industry would likely reduce the demand for our services.

	Growth in online advertising spending
	by China&#146;s automobile dealers and automakers.
</I>
	With the continuing growth of internet usage in China, the internet has become an increasingly important marketing and advertising channel to China&#146;s automotive industry. We believe we will
	continue to benefit from the growth in online advertising spending by automotive dealers and automakers in China.

	Market penetration

</I>
<I>

</I>
<I>
</I>
	Revenues from our advertising business are directly affected by the amount of advertisements placed by automobile customers on our bitauto.com website and, to a lesser extent, our
<I>
	taoche.com
</I>
	website. Our business and results of operations will depend significantly on our ability to grow our customer base, including expanding our services into new geographic areas and providing additional services to our existing customers. In addition,
	the content offerings and the attractiveness of our consumer-facing websites may significantly impact the traffic of automotive consumers to our websites, which in turn would affect automotive advertisers&#146; spending on our websites. Finally, we
	believe our automotive content&#146;s broad consumer reach achieved through our own automotive vertical websites and our partners is also a factor considered by our automobile customers when choosing our subscription and transaction services.

	Development of our EP platform business.

<I>
</I>
	Revenues from our EP platform business are directly affected by the number of
	subscribers to our EP platform and the length of subscriptions. Since 2014, we have started providing automobile customers with transaction services, including our automobile transactions, CRM and online automotive financial platform services. Since
	the businesses on EP platforms are relatively new in China and we are still exploring the best approaches to grow these businesses, we may need to invest additional resources to develop and market our new services.

	Expansion of customer base for our digital marketing solutions business.
</I>
	&nbsp;We have a limited number of automaker customers for our
	digital marketing solutions business. We anticipate that a small number of automakers will continue to represent a significant percentage of revenues for our digital marketing solutions business in the near future. The amount of advertising spending
	by these automaker customers, the addition of new automaker customers and/or the loss of any existing automaker customers will each have a direct impact on the revenues of our digital marketing solutions business and our total revenues.

	Under the Enterprise Income Tax Law, or EIT Law, and its implementation rules, enterprises established under the laws of jurisdictions outside
	China with their &#147;de facto management bodies&#148; located within China may be considered to be PRC tax resident enterprises for tax purposes. We are a holding company incorporated in the Cayman Islands, which indirectly holds, through our Hong
	Kong subsidiaries, 100% of our equity interests in our subsidiaries in the PRC. Our business operations are principally conducted through our PRC subsidiaries and its structured entities and most of our directors and management staff are PRC
	nationals. If we are considered a PRC tax resident enterprise under the above definition, then our global income will be subject to PRC enterprise income tax at the rate of 25%. Further, the EIT Law and the implementation rules provide that an
	income tax rate of 10% may be applicable to China-sourced income of foreign enterprises, such as dividends paid by a PRC subsidiary to its overseas parent company that is not a PRC resident enterprise, which (i) do not have an establishment or place
	of business in the PRC or (ii) have an establishment or place of business in the PRC but the relevant income is not effectively connected with the establishment or place of business, unless there are applicable treaties that reduce such rate. Under
	a special arrangement between China and Hong Kong, such dividend withholding tax rate is reduced to 5% if a Hong Kong resident enterprise owns more than 25% of the equity interest in the PRC company distributing the dividends and is determined by
	the competent PRC tax authority to have satisfied other conditions and requirements under the Double Tax Avoidance Arrangement between Hong Kong and Mainland China and other applicable PRC laws. As our Hong Kong subsidiaries own 100% of our PRC
	subsidiaries, under the aforesaid arrangement, any dividends that our PRC subsidiaries pay our Hong Kong subsidiary may be subject to a withholding tax at the rate of 5% if our Hong Kong subsidiary is not considered to be a PRC tax resident
	enterprise as described below and is determined by the competent PRC tax authority to have satisfied relevant conditions and requirements. However, if our Hong Kong subsidiary is not considered to be the beneficial owners of such dividends under a
	tax notice promulgated on October 27, 2009 or is determined by the competent PRC tax authority not to have satisfied any other relevant condition or requirement, such dividends would be subject to the withholding tax rate of 10%.

	including Beijing, Tianjin, Zhejiang Province (including Ningbo), Anhui Province, Guangdong Province (including Shenzhen), Fujian Province (including Xiamen), Hubei Province and Jiangsu province in 2012. The VAT Pilot Program has been rolled out to

	and assumptions that effect (i)&nbsp;the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, (ii)&nbsp;disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the end of each reporting period, and (iii)&nbsp;the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during

	conditions and assumptions. We consider the policies discussed below to be critical to an understanding of our consolidated financial statements as their application place significant demands on the judgment of our management. The following

	Consistent with the criteria of IAS 18,
<I>
	Revenue
</I>
	, we recognize revenue when the outcome of a transaction involving the rendering of
	services can be estimated reliably, by reference to the stage of completion of the transaction at the end of the reporting period. The outcome of a transaction can be estimated reliably when all the following conditions are satisfied: (i)&nbsp;the
	amount of revenue can be measured reliably; (ii)&nbsp;it is probable that the economic benefits associated with the transaction will flow to us; (iii)&nbsp;the stage of completion of the transaction at the end of the reporting period can be measured
	reliably; and (iv)&nbsp;the costs incurred for the transaction and the costs to complete the transaction can be measured reliably. We assess our revenue arrangements against specific criteria in order to determine if we are acting as principal or
	agent. Value-added tax is deducted from revenues. We enter into transactions that may include website design, set-up, and maintenance services, and customer relationship management services. The commercial effect of each separately identifiable
	component of the transaction is evaluated in order to reflect the substance of the transaction. The consideration from these transactions is allocated to each separately identifiable component based on the relative fair value of each component. We
	determine the fair value of each component based on the selling price of the component if sold separately by us. The consideration allocated to each component is recognized as revenue when the revenue recognition criteria for that component have
	been met. The following is a description of revenue recognition criteria for each of our services provided:
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:8%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
<I>
	Advertising services.
</I>
	Revenue from advertising activities is recognized when the advertisements are published over the stated display period and when the collectability is reasonably assured. We also organize promotional events to help customers to promote their
	products. We recognize revenue from organizing promotional events when the services have been rendered, and the collectability is reasonably assured. Revenues from advertising services are reported at a gross amount.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:8%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">

	information, such as the pricing of their automobiles, locations and addresses and other related information. The revenue is recognized on a straight-line basis over the subscription or listing period. Additionally, we provide customer relationship
	management services. The revenue is recognized when the services have been rendered and the collectability is reasonably assured. Revenues from dealer subscription and listing services are reported at a gross amount.

	services.

<I>
	Agent services.

	We receive commissions for assisting customers in placing advertisements on media vendor websites
	(&#147;advertising agent services&#148;). The net commission revenue from advertising agent services is recognized when the advertisements are published over the stated display period, and when the collectability is reasonably assured. We also

	paragraph 16 of the Practice Aid sets forth the preferred types of valuation that should be used.

	Our appraisers and we evaluated the use
	of three generally accepted valuation approaches: market, cost and income approaches to estimate our enterprise value. Our appraisers and we considered the market and cost approaches as inappropriate for valuing our ordinary shares because no
	comparable market transaction could be found for the market valuation approach and the cost approach does not directly incorporate information about the economic benefits contributed by our business operations. Consequently, our appraisers and we
	relied solely on the income approach in determining the fair value of our ordinary shares. This method eliminates the discrepancy in the time value of money by using a discount rate to reflect all business risks including intrinsic and extrinsic
	uncertainties in relation to our company. Accordingly, we, with the assistance of the independent appraisers, used the income approach to estimate the enterprise value at each date on which options were granted. We applied the methodologies
	consistently for all valuation dates.

	The income approach involves applying discounted cash flow analysis based on our projected cash
	flow using management&#146;s best estimate as of the valuation dates. Estimating future cash flow requires us to analyze projected revenue growth, gross margins, effective tax rates, capital expenditures and working capital requirements. Our
	projected revenues were based on expected annual growth rates derived from a combination of our historical experience and the general trend in China&#146;s automotive industry. The revenue and cost assumptions we used are consistent with our
	long-range business plan and market conditions in the online marketing and advertising industry. We also have to make complex and subjective judgments regarding our unique business risks, the liquidity of our shares and our limited operating history
	and future prospects at the time of grant or re-measurement. Other assumptions we used in deriving the fair value of our equity include:

	Our cash flows were
	discounted to present value using discount rates that reflect the risks the management perceived as being associated with achieving the forecasts and are based on the estimate of our weighted average cost of capital, or WACC, on each respective
	grant or re-measurement date. The WACCs were derived by using the capital asset pricing model, a method that market participants commonly use to price securities. Under the capital asset pricing model, the discount rate was determined considering
	the risk-free rate, industry-average correlated relative volatility coefficient, or beta, equity risk premium, size of our company, scale of our business and our ability in achieving forecast projections.

	We also applied a discount for lack of marketability to reflect the fact that, at the time of the grants, we were a privately held company and
	there was no public market for our equity securities. To determine the discount for lack of marketability, we and the independent appraisers used the Black-Scholes option pricing model. Pursuant to that model, we used the cost of a put option, which
	can be used to hedge the price change before a privately held share can be sold, as the basis to determine the discount for lack of marketability. A put option was used because it incorporates certain company-specific factors, including timing of
	the expected initial public offering and the volatility of the share price of the guideline companies engaged in the same industry. In evaluating comparable companies, we determined they should:

	For the purpose of determining the estimated fair value of our share options, we believe the fair

	our consolidated financial statements. Since we did not have a trading history for our shares sufficient to calculate our own historical volatility, expected volatility of our future ordinary share price was estimated based on the price volatility

	In determining taxable income for financial statement reporting purposes, we must make certain estimates and judgments. These estimates and

	We must assess the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax assets. The carrying amount
	of deferred income tax assets is reviewed at each reporting date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow all or part of the deferred tax asset to be utilized. Unrecognized
	deferred tax assets are reassessed at each reporting date and are recognized to the extent that it has become probable that future taxable profit will allow the deferred tax asset to be recovered. We consider past performance, future expected
	taxable income and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in determining the amount of deferred tax that can be recovered.

	Goodwill is initially measured at cost, being the excess of the aggregate of the consideration transferred
	and the amount recognized for non-controlling interest over the net identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed. If this consideration is lower than the fair value of the net assets of the subsidiary acquired, the difference is recognized
	in profit or loss. After initial recognition, goodwill is measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill acquired in a business combination is, from the acquisition date, allocated to the
	cash generating units that are expected to benefit from the combination, irrespective of whether other assets or liabilities of the acquiree are assigned to those units.

	From time to time, the rights on certain investments in which we have significant influence were
	modified with new rounds of financing. These modifications may be additions or removals of certain preferential rights. As a result of such modification, these equity investments, which were accounted for using equity method, were reclassified as
	investments accounted for under IAS 39, or vice versa. The carrying amount of the investments were remeasured upon the reclassification and a deemed disposal gain or loss was recognized.

	Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method. The cost of an acquisition is measured as the aggregate of the
	consideration transferred, measured at fair value on the date of acquisition and the amount of any non-controlling interest in the acquiree. For each business combination, the acquirer measures the non-controlling interest in the acquiree either at
	fair value or at the proportionate share of the acquiree&#146;s identifiable net assets. Acquisition costs incurred are expensed.

	The
	identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed are measured at their acquisition-date fair values, which are the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market
	participants at the measurement date under current market conditions. We determine the fair value for non-financial assets by considering the highest and best use of the asset from the perspective of market participants. When we acquire a business,
	we assess the financial assets and liabilities assumed for appropriate classification and designation in accordance with the contractual terms, economic circumstances and pertinent conditions as of the acquisition date. This includes the separation
	of embedded derivatives in host contracts by the acquiree.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:8%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	If the business combination is achieved in stages, the previously held equity
	interest is remeasured at its acquisition date fair value and any resulting gain or loss is recognized in profit and loss.

	Any contingent

	is deemed to be an asset or liability will be recognized in
	accordance with IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement (&#147;IAS 39&#148;) either in profit or loss or as change to other comprehensive income. If the contingent consideration is classified as equity, it shall not be remeasured.
	Subsequent settlement is accounted for within equity. In instances where the contingent consideration is not within the scope of IAS 39, it is measured in accordance with the appropriate IFRS.

	IFRS 9 &#147;Financial

	but simplifies the mixed measurement model and establishes three primary measurement categories for financial assets: amortized cost, fair value through other comprehensive income and fair value through profit or loss. The basis of classification
	depends on the entity&#146;s business model and the contractual cash flow characteristics of the financial asset. Investments in equity instruments are required to be measured at fair value through profit or loss with the irrevocable option at
	inception to present changes in fair value in other comprehensive income not recycling. There is now a new expected credit losses model that replaces the incurred loss impairment model used in IAS 39. For financial liabilities there were no changes
	to classification and measurement except for the recognition of changes in own credit risk in other comprehensive income, for liabilities designated at fair value through profit or loss. IFRS 9 relaxes the requirements for hedge effectiveness by
	replacing the bright line hedge effectiveness tests. It requires an economic relationship between the hedged item and hedging instrument and for the &#147;hedged ratio&#148; to be the same as the one management actually use for risk management
	purposes. Contemporaneous documentation is still required but is different to that currently prepared under IAS 39. This standard is effective for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2018 and early adoption is permitted.

	Our PRC subsidiaries are permitted to pay dividends to us only out of its retained earnings, if any, as
	determined in accordance with PRC accounting standards and regulations. Under PRC law, each of our PRC subsidiaries and their structured entities are required to set aside at least 10% of their after-tax profits each year, if any, to fund a
	statutory reserve until such reserve reaches 50% of their registered capital. Although the statutory reserves can be used, among other ways, to increase the registered capital and eliminate future losses in excess of retained earnings of the
	respective companies, the reserve funds are not distributable as cash dividends except in the event of liquidation. As a result of these PRC laws and regulations, our PRC subsidiaries are restricted in their ability to transfer a portion of their
	net assets, including general reserve and registered capital, either in the form of dividends, loans or advances. Such restricted portion of accumulated profits amounted to RMB18.3 million and RMB26.1 million (US$4.0 million) as of December&nbsp;31,

	We believe that our current cash and anticipated cash flows from our operations will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs,
	including our cash needs for working capital and capital expenditures, for at least the next 12 months. We may, however, require additional cash due to changing business conditions or other future developments, including any investments or
	acquisitions we may decide to pursue. If our existing cash is insufficient to meet our requirements, we may seek to sell additional equity securities, debt securities or borrow from lending institutions. Financing may be unavailable in the amounts
	we need or on terms acceptable to us, if at all. The sale of additional equity securities, including convertible debt securities, would dilute our earnings per share. The incurrence of debt would divert cash for working capital and capital
	expenditures to service debt obligations and could result in operating and financial covenants that restrict our operations and our ability to pay dividends to our shareholders. If we are unable to obtain additional equity or debt financing as

	For the advertising agent services we provide through our digital marketing solutions business, we act as an agent in placing advertisements on
	the websites of our media vendors on behalf of our automaker customers. We receive fees in the capacity of an agent for assisting automaker customers in placing advertisements on media vendors&#146; websites, and therefore, record the fees on a net
	basis in our consolidated financial statements. The net fees recognized from each such transaction amount to a relatively small percentage of the related accounts receivable or payable recorded on a gross basis. For the advertising services we
	provide through our bitauto.com advertising business and taoche.com business, we act as the principal in the arrangement and record revenues on a gross basis in our consolidated financial statements. Revenues are recognized only after the amount has
	been contractually agreed with our customers, the advertisements have been published and when the collectability is reasonably assured. For both the advertising agent services and advertising services provided, we enter into publishing schedule
	agreements with our automaker and automobile dealer customers, before we enter into related advertising agreements with the media vendors who are then obligated to place the advertisements according to the customers&#146; publishing schedule
	agreements. At such time, we record receivables from the customers and, in the same amount, corresponding payables due to the media vendors on a gross basis. Such payments are conducted through us. Gross billings include the gross value of
	advertisements placed by our customers that correspond to the gross payables recorded due to the media vendors. Gross billings for the year ended December 31, 2015 amounted to RMB5.39 billion (US$831.8 million) compared to RMB3.45 billion for the
	year ended December 31, 2014.

	or are longer than, the terms of our receivables due from our automaker customers. The remaining trade receivables as of December 31, 2015 were RMB1.40 billion (US$216.4 million). We have not experienced any collection issues that required us to
	provide for bad debts in connection with our receivables from our automaker customers. However, we may continue to be held liable to pay the media vendors the full amount of our payables when they become due and in advance of when we receive the
	related payments from our automaker customers. In addition, we may incur penalties for late payments. See &#147;Item 3. Key Information&#151;D. Risk Factors&#151;Risks Related to Our Business and Industry&#151;We may be liable to pay third-party
	media vendors in connection with the advertisements we placed with them on behalf of our automaker customers if we fail to collect some or all the payments from these automaker customers.&#148;

	Annual days sales outstanding, or DSO, for our automaker customers that have entered into revenue arrangements with us directly, is defined as
	average trade receivables due from these automakers divided by gross billings to these automakers, multiplied by 365 days. Annual DSO for other non-financial leasing customers, which include all of our other non-financial leasing customers other
	than our automaker customers that have entered into revenue arrangements with us directly, is defined as average trade receivables due from these customers divided by gross billings to these customers, multiplied by 365 days. Due to the seasonal
	nature of our business, we do not find DSO for interim periods a meaningful indicator of our business. In 2015, our annual DSO for automaker customers was 148 days and for other non-financial leasing customers was 90 days, compared to 149 days and
	82 days, respectively, in 2014.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:8%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	We are a Cayman Islands
	holding company and substantially all of our operations are conducted through our PRC subsidiaries, and our structured entities. We rely principally on dividends paid to us by our PRC subsidiaries for our cash requirements, including the funds
	necessary to pay dividends and other cash distributions to our shareholders, service any debt we may incur and pay our operating expenses. In China, the payment of dividends is subject to certain limitations. PRC regulations currently permit payment
	of dividends only out of accumulated profits as determined in accordance with PRC accounting standards and regulations. In addition, foreign-invested enterprises in China are required to allocate at least 10% of its after-tax profit based on PRC
	accounting standards to its statutory general reserves each year until the accumulative amount of the reserves reaches 50% of its registered capital. Our operating subsidiaries, as foreign-invested enterprises, are required to set aside funds for
	employee bonus and welfare fund from its after-tax profits each year at percentages determined at its sole discretion. These reserves are not distributable as cash dividends.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:8%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Our operating subsidiaries had accumulated profits amounting to RMB261.4 million (US$40.4 million) as of December 31, 2015 pursuant to PRC
	Accounting Standards. Therefore, our operating subsidiaries appropriated reserves amounting to RMB26.1 million (US$4.0 million) as of December 31, 2015. The accounting policies applied by our operating subsidiaries in preparing their financial
	statements under PRC accounting standards are materially consistent with our accounting policies under IFRS. There is no material difference between the accumulated profits of BBII determined under PRC accounting standards and the accumulated
	profits of BBII consolidated by us under IFRS. For a description of how earnings are transferred from our PRC subsidiaries, and our structured entities to us, see &#147;Item 7. Major Shareholders and Related Party Transactions&#151;B. Related Party
	Transactions&#151;Contractual Arrangements with our PRC Structured Entities and Their Shareholders.&#148;
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:8%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	In addition, we do not have any
	present plan to pay cash dividends on our ordinary shares in the foreseeable future. We currently intend to retain most, if not all, of our available funds and any future earnings to operate and expand our business.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:8%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Our board of directors has significant discretion on whether to distribute dividends. Even if our board of directors decides to pay dividends,
	the form, frequency and amount will depend upon our future operations and earnings, capital requirements and surplus, general financial position, contractual restrictions and other factors that the board of directors may deem relevant. If we pay any
	dividends, the depositary will distribute such payments to our ADS holders to the same extent as holders of our ordinary shares, subject to the terms of the deposit agreement, including the fees and expenses payable thereunder. Cash dividends on our
	ordinary shares, if any, will be paid in U.S. dollars.

	Under the Enterprise Income Tax Law, or EIT Law, and its implementation rules, enterprises established under the laws of jurisdictions outside
	China with their &#147;de facto management bodies&#148; located within China may be considered to be PRC tax resident enterprises for tax purposes. We are a holding company incorporated in the Cayman Islands, which indirectly holds, through our Hong
	Kong subsidiaries, 100% of our equity interests in our subsidiaries in the PRC. Our business operations are principally conducted through our PRC subsidiaries and their structured entities and most of our directors and management staff are PRC
	nationals. If we are considered a PRC tax resident enterprise under the above definition, then our global income will be subject to PRC enterprise income tax at the rate of 25%. Further, the EIT Law and the implementation rules provide that an
	income tax rate of 10% may apply to China-sourced income of foreign enterprises, such as dividends paid by a PRC subsidiaries to its overseas parent company that is not a PRC resident enterprise, which (i) do not have an establishment or place of
	business in the PRC or (ii) have an establishment or place of business in the PRC but the relevant income is not effectively connected with the establishment or place of business, unless there are applicable treaties that reduce such rate. Under a
	special arrangement between China and Hong Kong, such dividend withholding tax rate is reduced to 5% if a Hong Kong resident enterprise owns more than 25% of the equity interest in the PRC company distributing the dividends and is determined by the
	competent PRC tax authority to have satisfied other conditions and requirements under the Double Tax Avoidance Arrangement between Hong Kong and Mainland China and other applicable PRC laws. As our Hong Kong subsidiaries own 100% of our PRC
	subsidiaries, under the aforesaid arrangement, any dividends that our PRC subsidiaries pay our Hong Kong subsidiaries may be subject to a withholding tax at the rate of 5% if our Hong Kong subsidiaries are not considered to be a PRC tax resident
	enterprises as described below and is determined by the competent PRC tax authority to have satisfied relevant conditions and requirements. However, if our Hong Kong subsidiaries are not considered to be the beneficial owners of such dividends under
	a tax notice promulgated on October 27, 2009 or is determined by the competent PRC tax authority not to have satisfied any other relevant condition or requirement, such dividends would be subject to the withholding tax rate of 10%.

	The implementation rules of the Enterprise Income Tax Law provide that (i) if the enterprise that distributes dividends is domiciled in the
	PRC, or (ii) if gains are realized from transferring equity interests of enterprises domiciled in the PRC, then such dividends or capital gains are treated as China-sourced income. It is not clear how &#147;domicile&#148; may be interpreted under
	the EIT Law, and it may be interpreted as the jurisdiction where the enterprise is a tax resident. Therefore, if we are considered as a PRC tax resident enterprise for tax purposes, any dividends we pay to our overseas shareholders or ADS holders as
	well as gains realized by such shareholders or ADS holders from the transfer of our shares or ADSs may be regarded as China-sourced income and as a result become subject to PRC withholding tax at a rate of up to 10% if such shareholders are non-PRC
	resident enterprises or up to 20% if such shareholders are non-PRC resident individuals, and it is not clear whether the tax treaty benefit would be applicable in such cases.

	The Provisional Measures for the
	Administration of Withholding of Enterprise Income Tax for Non-resident Enterprises, or the Non-resident Enterprises Measures, the entities which have the direct obligation to make certain payments to a non-resident enterprise must be the relevant
	tax withholders for such non-resident enterprise. Further, the Non-resident Enterprise Measures provides that in case of an equity transfer between two non-resident enterprises which occurs outside China, the non-resident enterprise which receives
	the equity transfer payment must, by itself or engage an agent to, file a tax declaration with the PRC tax authority in the jurisdiction of the PRC company whose equity has been transferred, and the PRC company whose equity has been transferred
	shall assist the tax authorities to collect taxes from the relevant non-resident enterprise, or be subject to certain penalties and additions to interest for any tax due. By promulgating and implementing Circular 59 and Circular 698, the PRC tax
	authorities have enhanced their scrutiny over the direct or indirect transfer of equity interests in a PRC resident enterprise by a non-resident enterprise. Under Circular 698, except for the purchase and sale of equity interests through a public
	securities market, where a non-resident enterprise transfers the equity interests of a PRC &#147;resident enterprise&#148; indirectly by disposition of the equity interests of an overseas holding company, or an Indirect Transfer, the non-resident

	jurisdiction to both Indirect Transfer as set forth under Circular 698 and transactions involving the transfer of real property in China and assets of an establishment or a place in the PRC by a foreign company through the offshore transfer of a
	foreign intermediate holding company. Public Notice 7 interprets the term &#147;transfer of the equity interest in a foreign intermediate holding company&#148; broadly. In addition, Public Notice 7 clarifies certain criteria on how to assess
	reasonable commercial purposes and introduces safe harbor scenarios applicable to internal group restructurings. Pursuant to the Public Notice 7, both the foreign transferor and the transferee of the Indirect Transfer are required to make a
	self-assessment on whether the transaction should be subject to PRC tax and whether to file or withhold the PRC tax accordingly.

	The following is a summary of certain U.S. federal income tax considerations relating to the ownership and disposition
	of our ADSs or ordinary shares by a U.S. Holder (as defined below) that holds our ADSs or ordinary shares as &#147;capital assets&#148; (generally, property held for investment) under the United States Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended
	(&#147;the Code&#148;). This summary is based upon existing United States federal tax law, including the Code, its legislative history, existing, temporary and proposed regulations thereunder, published rulings and court decisions, all of which are
	subject to differing interpretations or change, possibly with retroactive effect. No ruling has been sought from the Internal Revenue Service (&#147;IRS&#148;) with respect to any U.S. federal income tax consequences described below, and there can
	be no assurance that the IRS or a court will not take a contrary position. This summary does not discuss all aspects of U.S. federal income taxation that may be important to particular holders in light of their individual investment circumstances,
	including holders subject to special tax rules that differ significantly from those summarized below (for example, banks, financial institutions, insurance companies, regulated investment companies, real estate investment trusts, broker-dealers,
	traders in securities that elect mark-to-market treatment, partnerships (or other entities treated as partnerships for U.S. federal income tax purposes) and their partners and tax-exempt organizations (including private foundations), holders who are
	not U.S. Holders, holders who own (directly, indirectly or constructively) 10% or more of our voting stock, holders who acquire their ADSs or ordinary shares pursuant to any employee share option or otherwise as compensation, holders who will hold
	their ADSs or ordinary shares as part of a straddle, hedge, conversion, constructive sale or other integrated transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes, certain expatriates or former long-term residents of the United States, governments or
	agencies or instrumentalities thereof, or holders who have a functional currency other than the United States dollar). In addition, this summary does not discuss any United States federal estate, gift or alternative minimum tax consequences or any
	non-United States, state or local tax considerations or the Medicare tax. Each U.S. Holder is urged to consult its tax advisor regarding the United States federal, state, local and non-United States income and other tax considerations relating to

	Passive Foreign Investment Company Considerations

</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:8%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	A non-United States corporation, such as our company, will be classified as a &#147;passive foreign investment company&#148; (a
	&#147;PFIC&#148;), for U.S. federal income tax purposes for any taxable year, if either (i) 75% or more of its gross income for such year consists of certain types of &#147;passive&#148; income or (ii) 50% or more of the value of its assets
	(determined on the basis of a quarterly average) during such year produce or are held for the production of passive income (the &#147;asset test&#148;). For this purpose, cash and assets readily convertible into cash are categorized as passive
	assets and the company&#146;s goodwill and unbooked intangibles associated with active business activities may generally be classified as non-passive assets. Passive income generally includes, without limitation, dividends, interest, royalties,
	rents, annuities, net gains from the sale or exchange of property producing such income, net gains from commodity transactions, net foreign currency gains and net income from notional principal contracts. We will be treated as owning a proportionate
	share of the assets and earning a proportionate share of the income of any other corporation in which we own, directly or indirectly, at least 25% (by value) of the stock.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:8%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Although the law in this regard is unclear, we treat our PRC structured entities as being owned by us for U.S. federal income tax purposes,
	not only because we exercise effective control over the operation of such entities but also because we are entitled to substantially all of their economic benefits, and, as a result, we consolidate their results of operations in our consolidated
	financial statements. If it were determined, however, that we were not the owner of our PRC structured entities for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we would likely be treated as a PFIC.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:8%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Assuming we are the owner of our PRC structured entities for U.S. federal income tax purposes, and based on our income, assets, and the market
	price of our ADSs, we do not believe that we were a PFIC for the taxable year ended December 31, 2015. However, there is a significant risk that we will be a PFIC for our taxable year ending December 31, 2016, and future taxable years unless the
	market price of our ADSs increases and/or we invest a substantial amount of cash and other passive assets we hold in assets that produce or are held for the production of non-passive income. Because the determination of whether we will be or become
	a PFIC is a fact-intensive inquiry made on an annual basis that depends, in part, on the composition of our income and assets, no assurance can be given with respect to our PFIC status for any taxable year. Fluctuations in the market price of our
	ADSs may cause us to become a PFIC for the current or subsequent taxable years because the value of assets for the purpose of the asset test, including the value of our goodwill and unbooked intangibles, may be determined by reference to the market
	price of our ADSs from time to time (which may be volatile). Furthermore, the composition of our income and assets may also be affected by how, and how quickly, we use our liquid assets. Under circumstances where our revenue from activities that
	produce passive income significantly increase relative to our revenue from activities that produce non-passive income, or where we determine not to deploy significant amounts of cash for active purposes, our risk of becoming classified as a PFIC may
	substantially increase. In addition, because there are uncertainties in the application of the relevant rules, it is also possible that the IRS may challenge our classification of certain income and assets as non-passive, which may result in our
	company being or becoming classified as a PFIC for the current or future taxable years.

	If we are classified as a PFIC for any year
	during which a U.S. Holder holds our ADSs or ordinary shares, we generally will continue to be treated as a PFIC for all succeeding years during which such U.S. Holder holds our ADSs or ordinary shares even if we cease to be a PFIC in subsequent
	years (unless such U.S. Holder makes a &#147;deemed sale&#148; election, as discussed below), and such a U.S. Holder will become subject to special rules discussed below. U.S. Holders are urged to consult with their tax advisors regarding the
	consequences of potentially holding an interest in a PFIC, and the ramifications of making a &#147;deemed sale&#148; election, as discussed further below.

	Any cash distributions (including the amount of any PRC tax withheld) paid on our ADSs or ordinary shares out of our current or accumulated
	earnings and profits, as determined under U.S. federal income tax principles, will generally be includible in the gross income of a U.S. Holder as dividend income on the day actually or constructively received by the U.S. Holder, in the case of
	ordinary shares, or by the depositary, in the case of ADSs. Because we do not intend to determine our earnings and profits on the basis of U.S. federal income tax principles, any distribution paid will generally be treated as a &#147;dividend&#148;
	for U.S. federal income tax purposes. A non-corporate recipient of dividend income generally will be subject to tax on dividend income from a &#147;qualified foreign corporation&#148; at the lower applicable capital gains rate rather than the
	marginal tax rates generally applicable to ordinary income, provided that certain holding period requirements are met. A non-United States corporation (other than a corporation that is classified as a PFIC for the taxable year in which the dividend
	is paid or the preceding taxable year) generally will be considered to be a qualified foreign corporation if (i) it is eligible for the benefits of a comprehensive tax treaty with the United States which the Secretary of Treasury of the United
	States determines is satisfactory for purposes of the rules applicable to qualified dividends and which includes an exchange of information program, or (ii) our ADSs or ordinary shares are readily tradable on an established securities market in the
	United States. Our ADSs are listed on the New York Stock Exchange and will be considered readily tradable on an established securities market in the United States for as long as the ADSs continue to be listed on such exchange. Thus, we believe that
	we will be a qualified foreign corporation with respect to dividends we pay on our ADSs, though no assurances can be given with respect to our ADSs in this regard.

	Since we do not expect that our ordinary shares will be listed on established securities markets, it is unclear whether dividends that we pay
	on our ordinary shares that are not backed by ADSs currently meet the conditions required for the reduced tax rate. However, in the event that we are deemed to be a PRC resident enterprise under the PRC Enterprise Income Tax Law (see &#147;Item 10.
	Additional Information&#151;E. Taxation&#151;People&#146;s Republic of China Taxation&#148;), we may be eligible for the benefits of the United States-PRC income tax treaty(which the Secretary of the Treasury of the United States has determined is
	satisfactory for this purpose) and be treated as a qualified foreign corporation with respect to dividends we pay on our ADSs or ordinary shares, regardless of whether such shares are represented by the ADSs. You are urged to consult your tax
	advisor regarding the availability of the lower rate for dividends paid with respect to our ADSs or ordinary shares. Dividends received on our ADSs or ordinary shares will not be eligible for the dividends-received deduction allowed to corporations.

	Dividends generally will be treated as income from foreign sources for United States foreign tax credit purposes and generally will
	constitute passive category income. In the event we are deemed to be a PRC resident enterprise under the PRC Enterprise Income Tax Law, a U.S. Holder may be subject to PRC withholding taxes on dividends paid, if any, on our ADSs or ordinary shares.
	A U.S. Holder may be eligible, subject to a number of complex limitations, to claim a foreign tax credit in respect of any foreign withholding taxes imposed on dividends received on our ADSs or ordinary shares. A U.S. Holder who does not elect to
	claim a foreign tax credit for foreign tax withheld, may instead claim a deduction, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, in respect of such withholdings, but only for a year in which such U.S. Holder elects to do so for all creditable foreign
	income taxes. The rules governing the foreign tax credit are complex. U.S. Holders are urged to consult their tax advisors regarding the availability of the foreign tax credit under their particular circumstances.

	A U.S. Holder will generally recognize capital gain or loss upon the sale or other disposition of ADSs or ordinary shares in amounts equal to
	the difference, if any, between the amount realized upon the disposition and the U.S. Holder&#146;s adjusted tax basis in such ADSs or ordinary shares. Any capital gain or loss will be long-term gain or loss if the ADSs or ordinary shares have been

	As an alternative to the foregoing rules, a U.S. Holder of &#147;marketable stock&#148; in a PFIC may make a mark-to-market election for such
	stock in a PFIC to elect out of the tax treatment discussed in the preceding paragraphs, provided such stock is regularly traded on a qualified exchange, including the New York Stock Exchange. We anticipate that our ADSs should qualify as being
	regularly traded on the New York Stock Exchange, but no assurances may be given in this regard. If a U.S. Holder makes a valid mark-to-market election with respect to our ADSs, the U.S. Holder will generally (i) include as ordinary income for each

	the ADSs over the fair market value of such ADSs held at the end of the taxable year, but only to the extent of the net amount previously included in income as a result of the mark-to-market election. The U.S. Holder&#146;s adjusted tax basis in the
	ADSs would be adjusted to reflect any income or loss resulting from the mark-to-market election. If a U.S. Holder makes a mark-to-market election in respect of a corporation classified as a PFIC and such corporation ceases to be classified as a
	PFIC, the U.S. Holder will not be required to take into account the gain or loss described above during any period that such corporation is not classified as a PFIC. If a U.S. Holder makes a mark-to-market election, any gain such U.S. Holder
	recognizes upon the sale or other disposition of our ADSs will be treated as ordinary income and any loss will be treated as ordinary loss, but only to the extent of the net amount previously included in income as a result of the mark-to-market
	election. In the case of a U.S. Holder who has held ADSs during any taxable year in respect of which we were classified as a PFIC and continues to hold such ADSs (or any portion thereof) and has not previously determined to make a mark-to-market

	Our presentation currency is Renminbi. The functional currencies of our holding company Bitauto Holdings Limited and our wholly owned
	subsidiaries outside of China are U.S. dollar and Hong Kong dollar, while the functional currency of our PRC subsidiaries and structured entities is Renminbi. We earn all of our revenues and incur most of our expenses in Renminbi, and substantially
	all of our services contracts are denominated in Renminbi. We do not believe that we currently have any significant direct foreign exchange risk and have not used any derivative financial instruments to hedge our exposure to such risk. Although in
	general, our exposure to foreign exchange risks should be limited, the value of your investment in our ADSs will be affected by the exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and the Renminbi because the value of our business is effectively denominated
	in Renminbi, while the ADSs will be traded in U.S. dollars.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:8%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The value of the Renminbi against the U.S. dollar and other currencies may
	fluctuate and is affected by, among other things, changes in China&#146;s political and economic conditions. The conversion of Renminbi into foreign currencies, including U.S. dollars, is based on rates set by the People&#146;s Bank of China. The
	PRC government allowed the Renminbi to appreciate by more than 20% against the U.S. dollar between July 2005 and July 2008. Between July 2008 and June 2010, this appreciation was halted and the exchange rate between the Renminbi and the U.S. dollar
	remained within a narrow band. Since June 2010, Renminbi has fluctuated against the U.S. dollar, at times significantly and unpredictably, and in recent months Renminbi has depreciated significantly against the U.S. dollar.&nbsp;It is difficult to
	predict how market forces or PRC or U.S. government policy may impact the exchange rate between the RMB and the U.S. dollar in the future.

	To the extent that we need to convert U.S. dollars into RMB for capital expenditures and working capital and other business purposes,
	appreciation of the RMB against the U.S. dollar would have an adverse effect on the RMB amount we would receive from the conversion. Conversely, if we decide to convert RMB into U.S. dollars for the purpose of making payments for dividends on our
	ordinary shares or ADSs, strategic acquisitions or investments or other business purposes, appreciation of the U.S. dollar against the RMB would have a negative effect on the U.S. dollar amount available to us.

	Our exposure to interest
	rate risk primarily relates to the interest income generated by excess cash, which is mostly held in interest-bearing bank deposits. We have not used derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio. Interest earning instruments carry a
	degree of interest rate risk. We have not been exposed to, nor do we anticipate being exposed to, material risks due to changes in market interest rates.

	Our earnings are affected by changes in interest rates due to the impact of such changes on interest income and
	interest expense from interest-bearing financial assets and liabilities. Our interest-bearing financial assets comprised primarily of cash deposits at floating rates based on Hong Kong Interbank Offered Rate and People&#146;s Bank of China daily
	bank deposit rates.

	For the year ended December 31, 2013, 2014 and 2015, interest income from cash deposits was approximately RMB8.1
	million, RMB13.6 million and RMB25.0 million (US$3.9 million). The weighted average interest rate on our cash deposits is 0.95%, 1.14% and 1.07% for the year ended December 31, 2013, 2014 and 2015. The following demonstrates the sensitivity to a
	reasonably possible change in interest rates on that portion of interest-bearing financial assets affected. With all other variables held constant, a 0.5% increase or decrease in annual interest rates would increase or decrease interest income by
	RMB17.0 million (US$2.6 million), respectively, based on the cash, cash equivalents and time deposits balance at December 31, 2015 (2014: RMB6.4 million).

	Management&#146;s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting
</B>
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:8%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as defined under Rule
	13(a)-15(f) and 15(d)-15(f) of the Exchange Act. Our internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external
	purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Our internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that: (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and
	fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles
	and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and directors; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or
	disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:8%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Because of its inherent limitations, internal
	control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that
	the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Management, under the supervision and with the participation of our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our
	internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee on Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on our evaluation under the framework in Internal
	Control-Integrated Framework (2013), our management concluded that, as of December 31, 2015, our internal control over financial reporting was effective to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the
	preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with IFRS.

	To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Bitauto Holdings Limited:
</B>
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated statements of financial position and the related consolidated statements of comprehensive income, changes in
	equity and cash flows present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Bitauto Holdings Limited and its subsidiaries at December&nbsp;31, 2015, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for the year ended
	December&nbsp;31, 2015 in conformity with International Financial Reporting Standards as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over
	financial reporting as of December&nbsp;31, 2015, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013)&nbsp;issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). The Company&#146;s
	management is responsible for these financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Management&#146;s
	Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting appearing under Item&nbsp;15 of the accompanying Form 20-F. Our responsibility is to express opinions on these financial statements and on the Company&#146;s internal control over financial
	reporting based on our integrated audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable
	assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit of the financial statements included examining, on
	a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. Our audit
	of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of
	internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	A company&#146;s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial
	reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company&#146;s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that
	(i)&nbsp;pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii)&nbsp;provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as
	necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors
	of the company; and (iii)&nbsp;provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company&#146;s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of
	effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

	The Company re-assesses whether or not it controls an investee if facts and circumstances indicate

	adjustment to non-controlling interests and any consideration paid or received is recognized in a separate reserve within equity attributable to owners of the Company.

	Intangible assets with finite lives are amortized over the useful economic life on straight line basis and
	assessed for impairment whenever there is an indication that the intangible asset may be impaired. The amortization period and the amortization method for an intangible asset with a finite useful life are reviewed at least at each financial year
	end. Changes in the expected useful life or the expected pattern of consumption of future economic benefits embodied in the asset are considered to modify the amortization period or method, as appropriate, and treated as changes in accounting
	estimates. The amortization expense on intangible assets with finite lives is recognized in profit or loss in the expense category consistent with the function of the intangible asset.

	Intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are not amortized, but are tested for impairment annually, either individually or at the CGU
	level. The assessment of indefinite life is reviewed annually to determine whether indefinite life assessment continues to be supportable. If not, the change in the useful life assessment from indefinite to finite is made on a prospective basis.

	The Group assesses at each reporting date whether there is an indication that an asset may be impaired. If any

	and its value in use and is determined for an individual asset, unless the asset does not generate cash inflows that are largely independent of those from other assets or groups of assets. When the carrying amount of an asset or CGU exceeds its

	amounts due according to the original terms of the receivables. Significant financial difficulties of the debtor, probability that the debtor will enter bankruptcy or financial reorganization, and default or delinquency in payments are considered
	indicators that the trade receivable is impaired. The amount of the provision is the difference between the asset&#146;s carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows, discounted at the original effective interest rate. Cash
	flows relating to short-term receivables are discounted if the effect of discounting is material. The carrying amount of the asset is reduced through the use of an allowance account and the amount of the loss is recognized in profit or loss. When a
	trade receivable is uncollectible, it is written-off against the allowance account for trade receivables. Subsequent recoveries of amounts previously written-off are recognized as income in profit or loss.

	The cost of equity-settled transactions with employees is measured by reference to the fair value
	at the date on which they are granted. The cost of equity-settled transactions with employees is recognized, together with a corresponding increase in equity, and presented as employee equity benefit reserve, over the period in which the performance
	and/or service conditions are fulfilled. The cumulative expense recognized for equity-settled transactions at each reporting date until the vesting date reflects the extent to which the vesting period has passed and the Group&#146;s best estimate of
	the number of equity instruments that will ultimately vest. The expense or credit recognized in profit or loss for a period represents the movement in cumulative expense recognized as at the beginning and end of that period.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; MARGIN-LEFT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Where the terms of an equity-settled transaction are modified, the minimum expense recognized is the expense as if the terms had not been

	date of modification.

	Where an equity-settled award is cancelled, it is treated as if it vested on the date of cancellation, and any
	expense not yet recognized for the award is recognized immediately. However, if a new award is substituted for the cancelled award, and designated as a replacement award on the date that it is granted, the cancelled and new awards are treated as if

	Non-employee equity-settled transactions are
	generally accounted for in the same manner as employee equity-settled transactions except for the measurement date and measurement basis of the expense. Non-employee costs are measured and recognized at the service date, which is the date when goods
	or services are rendered to the Group. This implies that, where the goods or services are received on a number of dates over a period, the fair value at each date should be used. Therefore, at each date the non-employee provides service, the fair
	value needs to be calculated and recorded as an expense with a corresponding increase in equity. The measurement basis of the expense is the fair value of the goods or services received by the Group, and only on the fair value of the equity
	instruments if, the fair value of the goods and services cannot be reliably estimated.

	The determination of whether an arrangement is, or contains, a lease is based on the substance of the arrangement at the inception date. The

	Where the Group is a lessee and the Group has substantially all the risks

	corresponding rental obligations, net of finance charges, are included in other short-term and long-term payables. Each lease payment is allocated between the liability and finance cost. The finance cost is charged to the profit or loss over the
	lease period so as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability for each period. The property, plant and equipment acquired under finance leases is depreciated over the asset&#146;s useful life or over

	IFRS 9 &#147;Financial instruments&#148; addresses the classification, measurement and recognition of financial assets and financial liabilities. It replaces the guidance in IAS 39 that relates to the classification and
	measurement of financial instruments. IFRS 9 retains but simplifies the mixed measurement model and establishes three primary measurement categories for financial assets: amortized cost, fair value through other comprehensive income and fair value
	through profit or loss. The basis of classification depends on the entity&#146;s business model and the contractual cash flow characteristics of the financial asset. Investments in equity instruments are required to be measured at fair value through
	profit or loss with the irrevocable option at inception to present changes in fair value in other comprehensive income not recycling. There is now a new expected credit losses model that replaces the incurred loss impairment model used in IAS 39.
	For financial liabilities there were no changes to classification and measurement except for the recognition of changes in own credit risk in other comprehensive income, for liabilities designated at fair value through profit or loss. IFRS 9 relaxes
	the requirements for hedge effectiveness by replacing the bright line hedge effectiveness tests. It requires an economic relationship between the hedged item and hedging instrument and for the &#147;hedged ratio&#148; to be the same as the one
	management actually use for risk management purposes. Contemporaneous documentation is still required but is different to that currently prepared under IAS 39. This standard is effective for annual periods beginning on or after January&nbsp;1, 2018
	and early adoption is permitted.

	In May 2014, the Group set up a joint venture with several leading Chinese automobile dealers or service providers, to develop the used car
	business. The original registered capital of the joint venture was RMB100,000,000 and the Group contributed RMB20,000,000 to hold 20% equity interest pursuant to joint venture agreement. In May 2015, the shareholders of the entity agreed to reduce
	the registered capital to RMB30,000,000, in which the capital contributed by other shareholders was reduced to RMB10,000,000 while the capital contributed by the Group remained. As a result, the Group held 66.67% equity interest of the entity and
	obtained control. The fair value of the identifiable net assets as at the date of acquisition was approximately RMB30,000,000.

	The Group did not provide for deferred taxes on the undistributed earnings of its
	subsidiaries and SEs as of December&nbsp;31, 2014 and 2015 on the basis of its intent to reinvest the earnings. The Company is able to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences of its subsidiaries and SEs. The undistributed
	earnings amounted to RMB1,002,163,912 and RMB1,474,603,788 as of December&nbsp;31, 2014 and 2015, respectively. The majority of associates and joint ventures are established in the PRC and the related temporary differences for such investments will
	be reversed through future distribution, which are nontaxable. The Company also does not intend to sell its interests in its associates and joint ventures. Therefore, management considered that it is probable that the temporary differences will not
	be reversed in the foreseeable future. Determination of the amount of unrecognized deferred tax liabilities is not practicable.

	The recoverable amount of each CGU was determined based on a value in use calculation using cash flow projections based on financial budgets

	The over-allotment option expired unexercised on January&nbsp;6, 2014 and will have no potential dilutive
	effect in the future. The convertible preference shares (Note19.3) issued in 2015 by Yixin Capital Limited, a subsidiary of the Group, could potentially dilute basic earnings per ordinary share in the future, but were not included in the calculation
	of diluted earnings per share because they are anti-dilutive for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2015. There have been no other significant transactions involving ordinary shares or potential ordinary shares between the reporting date and the date

	The available-for-sale financial assets and financial assets at fair value through profit or loss are

	The Group&#146;s earnings are affected by changes in interest rates due to
	the impact of such changes on interest income and interest expense from interest-bearing financial assets and liabilities. The Group&#146;s interest-bearing financial assets comprised primarily of cash deposits at floating rates based on Hong Kong
	Interbank Offered Rate and People&#146;s Bank of China daily bank deposit rates. For the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2015, the interest income from cash deposits was approximately RMB24,980,457 (2014: RMB13,606,952; 2013: RMB8,111,431). The
	weighted average interest rate on the Group&#146;s cash deposits is 1.07% for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2015 (2014: 1.14%; 2013: 0.95%). The following demonstrates the sensitivity to a reasonably possible change in interest rates on that
	portion of interest-bearing financial assets affected. With all other variables held constant, a 0.5% increase or decrease in annual interest rates would increase or decrease interest income by RMB16,957,644, respectively, based on the cash, cash
	equivalents and time deposits balance as of December&nbsp;31, 2015 (2014: RMB6,413,313).

	Borrowings carry at floating rates expose the
	Group to cash flow interest-rate risk whereas those carry at fixed rates expose the Group to fair value interest-rate risk. The Group&#146;s interest-bearing financial liabilities comprised primarily of borrowings from bank at fixed rates which do
	not expose the Group to cash flow interest rate risk. The interest expense incurred for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2015 was RMB4,525,236 (2014: nil; 2013: nil).

	The Group&#146;s exposure to liquidity risk is the amounts recognized as
	financial liabilities (Note 19). The current financial liabilities are amounting to RMB1,522,288,023 for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2015 (2014: RMB722,913,357), and non-current financial liabilities excluding convertible preference shares are
	amounting to RMB24,361,234 for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2015 (2014: RMB38,323,654). As of December&nbsp;31, 2015, convertible preference shares were classified as non-current financial liabilities because the Group believes that it does not
	have obligation to settle the liability within 12 months after the end of the reporting period. There is no material net liquidity risk due to cash and cash equivalents balances amounting to RMB1,221,472,624 and RMB2,940,874,390 as of

	A majority of the customers who wish to trade on credit terms are subject to
	credit verification procedures. In addition, receivable balances are monitored on an ongoing basis via the Group&#146;s management reporting procedures. The Group provides longer payment terms, ranging from 120 to 180 days to particular automaker
	customers after applying strict credit requirements based on the Group&#146;s credit policy. These automaker customers, which comprise approximately 41.6% of total receivables as of December&nbsp;31, 2015 (2014: approximately 48.7%), are major,
	long-standing customers and are mostly joint venture entities between PRC state-owned enterprises and international automakers. The related PRC state-owned enterprises have access to funds from the PRC government and thus do not represent
	substantial credit risks. However, with their influence in the automotive industry in the PRC, these customers are able to demand longer payment terms from their suppliers, such as the Group.

	Credit risk from balances with banks and financial institutions is managed by the
	Group&#146;s treasury in accordance with the Group&#146;s policy. As of December&nbsp;31, 2014 and 2015, substantially all of the Group&#146;s cash and cash equivalents and time deposits were held by various reputable Chinese major financial
	institutions located in the PRC and Hong Kong. Historically, deposits in Chinese banks are secured due to the state policy on protecting depositors&#146; interests. However, the PRC promulgated a new Bankruptcy Law in August 2006 that has come into
	effect on June&nbsp;1, 2007, which contains a separate article expressly stating that the State Council promulgates implementation measures for the bankruptcy of Chinese banks based on the Bankruptcy Law when necessary. Under the new Bankruptcy Law,
	a Chinese bank can go into bankruptcy. In addition, since the PRC&#146;s accession to the World Trade Organization, foreign banks have been gradually permitted to operate in the PRC and have been significant competitors against Chinese banks in many
	aspects, especially since the opening of the Renminbi business to foreign banks in late 2006. Therefore, the risk of bankruptcy of those Chinese banks in which the Group has deposits has increased. In the event of bankruptcy of one of the banks
	which holds the Group&#146;s deposits, it is unlikely to claim its deposits back in full since it is unlikely to be classified as a secured creditor based on PRC laws. Since the global financial crisis began during the third quarter of 2008, the
	risk of bankruptcy of those banks in which the Group has deposits or investments has increased significantly. In the event of bankruptcy of one of these financial institutions, it may be unlikely to claim its deposits or investments back in full.
	The Group maintains its deposits across a diversified portfolio of financial institutions and continues to monitor the financial strength of these financial institutions. The Group&#146;s maximum exposure to credit risk for the components of the
	consolidated statement of financial position as of December&nbsp;31, 2014 and 2015 is the carrying amounts as illustrated in Note 19. The Group&#146;s maximum exposure for financial instruments is noted in Note 19.

	Foreign Investment and the articles of association of the Company&#146;s PRC subsidiaries, foreign-invested enterprises established in the PRC are required to provide certain statutory reserves, which are appropriated from net profit as reported in
	the enterprise&#146;s PRC statutory accounts. A foreign-invested enterprise is required to allocate at least 10% of its annual after-tax profit to the statutory reserve until such reserve has reached 50% of its respective registered capital based on
	the enterprise&#146;s PRC statutory accounts. Foreign-invested enterprises are also required to set aside funds for the employee bonus and welfare fund from their after-tax profits each year at percentages determined at their sole discretion. The
	aforementioned reserves can only be used for specific purposes and are not distributable as cash dividends. The Company&#146;s PRC subsidiaries were established as foreign-invested enterprises and, therefore, are subject to the above mandated
	restrictions on distributable profits.
