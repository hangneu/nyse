	Statements regarding

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The methodology for calculating
	performance measures such as subscriber numbers, average revenue per user (&#147;ARPU&#148;) and churn rates varies substantially among operators and is not standardized across the telecommunications industry, and reported performance measures thus
	vary from those that would probably result from the use of a single methodology. In addition, subscriber numbers in the mobile communications sector may be difficult to calculate as a result of individuals having more than one SIM card or SIM cards
	being removed due to periods of inactivity. The differing methodologies for calculating these performance indicators make it difficult to draw comparisons between these figures for, and to determine the relative market share of, different mobile
	operators.

	We believe Adjusted EBITDA, among other measures, facilitates performance comparisons from period
	to period and management decision making. It also facilitates performance comparisons from company to company. Adjusted EBITDA as a performance measure eliminates potential differences caused by variations in capital structures (affecting interest
	expense), tax positions (such as the impact of changes in effective tax rates on periods or companies) and the age and book depreciation and amortization of tangible and intangible assets (affecting relative depreciation and amortization expense).
	We also present Adjusted EBITDA because we believe it is frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties in evaluating the performance of other mobile operators in the telecommunications industry in Europe, many of
	which present Adjusted EBITDA when reporting their results.

	Republic of Turkey (&#147;CBRT&#148;). The assets and liabilities of foreign operations, including goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on acquisition, are translated to TRY from the
	functional currency of the foreign operation at foreign exchange rates prevailing at the reporting date. The income and expenses of foreign operations are translated to TRY at monthly average exchange rates excluding foreign operations in
	hyperinflationary economies which are translated to TRY at exchange rates at the reporting date.

	The income and expenses of foreign
	operations in hyperinflationary economies are translated to TRY at the exchange rate at the reporting date. Prior to translating the financial statements of foreign operations in hyperinflationary economies, their financial statements for the
	current period are restated to account for changes in the general purchasing power of the local currency. The restatement is based on relevant price indices at the reporting date. As stated in the annual monetary and exchange rate policy
	announcements of the CBRT, which have been published since 2002, the foreign exchange rate is not a policy tool or target; it is determined by the supply and demand conditions in the market. Along with inflation targeting, the CBRT announced that it
	will continue to support financial stability and the implementation of the floating exchange rate regime in&nbsp;2016.

	The
	hyperinflationary period in Turkey ceased by December 31, 2005 and commenced in Belarus on January 1, 2011 and ceased by January 1, 2015. Accordingly, the economy of Belarus was considered to transit out of hyperinflationary status and determined to
	cease applying IAS 29 starting from January 1, 2015.

	The majority of our revenue comes from our operations in Turkey. Competition in this market and certain regulatory actions that limit our
	ability to respond effectively to competitive pressures may adversely affect the growth of our business and our financial condition. Continued price and higher incentive-driven competition has, and will continue to, put pressure on our prices,
	market shares and profitability, as well as our liquidity. If the competition further intensifies, or the market slows or develops in unexpected ways, this could harm our business and financial condition.

	In this market, we currently face intensifying competition from two other operators, Vodafone and Turk Telekom Group, including its
	wholly-owned subsidiary Avea. As part of the changes to our strategy announced in 2015, we have begun taking an integrated approach to the mobile, fixed and TV businesses. When viewing mobile and fixed as a single converged market, we are the second
	largest player in Turkey in terms of revenue, after the Turk Telekom Group, whereas when viewing the mobile market alone, we are the market leader.

	In light of this newly-defined strategy and market, our aim is to solidify our position in Turkey as a converged communications and technology
	services company. However, our convergence strategy faces numerous challenges, including gaining access to infrastructure, particularly from the incumbent operator, and to content. We also face the challenge of building or acquiring required assets
	at a reasonable cost. Furthermore, within our own organization, legal impediments prevent us from freely marketing all of our services to all of our subscribers.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	As other operators in Turkey are also moving towards converged services, aggressively priced converged offers may have an adverse effect on
	our revenue, ARPU and our market share.&nbsp;Furthermore, convergence may increase the level of competition from other operators that have not been our traditional competitors, such as television service providers, that may prevent us from acquiring
	new customers.&nbsp;On the other hand, our market position may be adversely impacted if we fail to provide converged services on a timely or competitive basis relative to our competitors.

	Turkey&#146;s principal telecommunications regulator, the ICTA, has interfered, and may continue to interfere, with our ability to price our
	services and respond to competitive pressures. Regulatory actions such as the ICTA&#146;s regulations on our retail pricing and the ICTA&#146;s ongoing pressure on interconnection rates and maximum retail prices have also been, and will likely
	continue to be, a significant factor in shaping the development of the Turkish market and in our ability to respond to changes in the market. Regulatory actions have often favored our competitors, and have facilitated increased competition. It is
	also possible that the ICTA may act to regulate converged offers, and we cannot predict the impact that such regulation will have on our ability to execute our convergence strategy and on our competitive position.&nbsp;Furthermore, sub-brand
	initiatives of the existing competitors, and new licenses and authorizations issued by the regulator such as Fixed Telephony Service (&#147;FTS&#148;) and Mobile Virtual Network Operator (&#147;MVNO&#148;) licenses have made it easier and/or more
	attractive for new direct and indirect competitors to enter the market.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Competition has also been affected by the increasing use of
	applications and services that make use of the internet as a substitute (namely &#147;over the top&#148; or &#147;OTT&#148; services) for some of our more traditional services, such as messaging and voice. These have had an adverse impact on our
	revenues which may in the future be material. Reduced demand for our core services of voice, messaging and data could significantly impact our growth and profitability.

	With respect to terminals, there is an increasing emphasis in the Turkish market on terminal bundled campaigns. Increased demand for terminal
	bundled campaigns will continue to lead higher working capital requirements and bad debt expense. Working capital requirements related to terminal financing and bad debt expenses are planned to be managed by our consumer finance company, which
	commenced operations in 2016.

	TeliaSonera, our partner in Fintur Holdings B.V. (&#147;Fintur&#148;) through its 58.55% stake, has initiated a process to divest its Eurasian
	assets. In line with our growth strategy and as the minority (41.45%) shareholder in Fintur (operating in Kazakhstan, Azerbaijan, Georgia and Moldova), we submitted a binding offer to acquire TeliaSonera&#146;s 58.55% stake in Fintur and its 24%
	direct stake in Kcell JSC (Kazakhstan). No assurance can be given that we will acquire these stakes on commercially viable terms. These acquisitions will entail certain risks, including an increase in our debt, increased exposure to fluctuations in
	currencies that have been prone to devaluation, increased exposure to countries that have a high risk of corruption and other compliance issues. Furthermore, we will be exposed to risks in our ability to successfully integrate these companies, their
	systems and their networks and to implement new strategies, and to the reaction of customers, competitors and regulators. If we do not complete these acquisitions, we also face the risk that TeliaSonera may sell to another party, leaving us as a
	minority shareholder with a new majority shareholder not chosen by us. Should there be a disagreement between us and the other shareholder in the future, no assurance can be given that we will be able to take the course of action that we believe
	appropriate, including with respect to operational and strategic matters. We may also have difficulty exiting, should we choose to do so, at an acceptable price.

	New investments may not achieve expected returns or returns that are in line with those of our core business, which may cause high value

	provide the expected returns, we may need to make further investment or we may consider disposal at a sale price that may be below carrying value or liquidation.

	In the context of our evaluation of potential investments in the regions we target for international expansion, Turkcell has considered
	opportunities in countries in the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS), Eastern Europe, the Balkans and the Middle East and Africa (&#147;MEA&#148;), and may consider such opportunities in the future. Operations in many of these countries are
	subject to economic, political and other risks. Furthermore, for acquisitions outside of Turkey, current and future E.U., U.S. and international laws and regulations, as well as legal and regulatory actions, targeting certain countries, local
	companies and individuals may curtail our ability to do business in affected countries and may impede our exercise of control. Turkcell itself, as well as certain of its key employees (notably those who are E.U. or U.S. citizens), could be subject
	to sanctions under such laws and regulations. Some of the countries and companies in which we have contemplated making investments and in which we may from time to time consider opportunities, such as Iran, Libya and Syria, and certain individuals
	involved in such companies, have been the specific targets of such laws and regulations. Similarly, jurisdictions in which we have invested may from time to time become subject to sanctions, as has been the case in Crimea. Investors may be reticent
	to invest in a company doing business in such countries or other countries that may be at risk due to the political instability. These factors could have an adverse effect on the demand for and the price of our shares.

	Our industry is subject to extensive regulation, in Turkey and the other countries in which we

	and offer new and existing services, including converged services, on customer use of our services, the way we handle, process and store customer data, the terms of our subscriber contracts, the way we can communicate with customers, including in
	particular our ability to contact subscribers with new converged offers, and our ability to obtain and maintain licenses. Furthermore, the laws, regulations, regulatory orders and licenses under which we operate are subject to interpretation and

	In the areas of customer protection and unsolicited electronic communications for the purposes of

	With a substantial portion of our revenues, assets and business derived from and
	located in Turkey, and denominated in Turkish Lira, adverse developments in the Turkish economy are likely to have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition. The performance of the Turkish economy may be affected by global,
	regional and domestic economic and political developments. In our view, the biggest threats to the global economy, including Turkey, into 2016 are the sustainability of economic growth and the sustainability of current low energy prices, which have
	generally benefitted the Turkish economy and the country&#146;s current account deficit. The effect of prolonged low energy prices on commodity exporter countries in the region such as Russia, Saudi Arabia and Iran may negatively affect terms of
	trade between these countries and Turkey. Other potential threats to the Turkish economy result from uncertainty regarding the normalization of U.S. monetary policy, high volatility caused by concerns regarding Chinese growth, continuing Eurozone
	deflation risks, and geopolitical tensions and instability in Ukraine and the Middle East, including along Turkey&#146;s borders and in the southeastern part of Turkey, in the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS), the Balkans and Caucasus
	regions. The Turkish economy is also sensitive to instability in the domestic political environment, which has been a factor in recent years. After the general elections held in June 2015 failed to result in a majority government, early elections
	that were held on November 1, 2015, which saw another term of single party government and eased political uncertainties. Moreover, political decisions in the local, regional or global arena to limit internet access (including limiting access to
	YouTube or twitter) may negatively impact our revenues.

	Our development strategy in Ukraine in 2015 was marked by our acquisition of the 44.96% in lifecell that we did not own, with a view to strengthening our regional position, a restructuring of lifecell&#146;s balance
	sheet, and the acquisition of a 3G license at a cost of UAH 3,355 million (equivalent to TRY 406.5 million as of December 31, 2015) paid in 2015, plus UAH 358 million (equivalent to TRY 43.3 million as of December 31, 2015) paid in 2015 for spectrum
	conversion and an additional UAH 426 million (equivalent to TRY 51.6 million) committed to be paid and indexed to inflation. These increases in our investment have further increased our country and currency risk exposure. There can be no assurance
	that we will be able to develop a 3G network on commercially reasonable terms and that we will not experience delays in developing our network, in each case harming our competitive position and the value of our investment.

	The economic situation is fragile in Belarus. The country remains vulnerable to global shocks which may trigger renewed weakness in the country&#146;s ability to service its external debt and further depreciation of the
	local currency, Belarusian Rubles (&#147;BYR&#148;), which could in turn lead to a further reduction in the value of our investment in this country. The BYR depreciated against the U.S. Dollar by 25% in 2014 and further depreciated in 2015 by 57%.
	Devaluation risks still remain, as limited currency reserves, high debt repayments and the current account deficit coupled with the close ties to the currently troubled Russian economy puts the recent BYR stabilization at risk and creates
	inflationary and devaluation pressure. In line with our strategic priority of improving our balance sheet structure, the outstanding debt of Belarusian Telecom has been restructured. As part of the restructuring, Belarusian Telecom&#146;s total
	existing intra-group loans were converted into subordinated loans, provided directly by Turkcell. As of December 31, 2015, Belarusian Telecom&#146;s outstanding debt was BYR 39.5 billion (equivalent to TRY 6.2 million as of December 31, 2015) owed

	We are expecting a major step forward in the development of telecommunications in Turkey

	commercially reasonable terms, that we will not experience delays in developing our networks or that we will be able to meet all of the license terms and conditions. The auction for the 4.5G license was held on August 26, 2015. Although we were
	awarded the broadest frequency band of any mobile operator, the cost of the 4.5G license as well as the capital expenditure required in connection with our 4.5G build-out is expected to be material. Furthermore, the license agreement contains
	certain onerous terms that may weigh on the profitability of this investment and may have an adverse effect on our 4.5G investment plans in the future. These include terms regarding minimum required usage of domestic equipment in meeting
	infrastructure obligations (equipment that is currently not available on the market), an active network sharing obligation for a portion of the population, high coverage obligations for roads and railroads and significant taxes and spectrum usage
	fees, which will increase as the number of frequencies used increases. No assurance can be given that we will not experience delays in developing our 4.5G network or that competing licensees will not complete their build-outs before we do. Demand
	for 4.5G services may also not be at the level we expect, such that the return of investment we make in connection with 4.5G may not meet our expectations. Any of the foregoing could harm our competitive position and our profitability.

	In recent years, legal proceedings have been brought
	against mobile operators seeking the removal of base station sites for health reasons. In addition, the Turkish Supreme Court overruled the decisions of some local courts, finding that a base station in question could have negative effects on human
	health over the long term. If the number of those cases increases or if new regulations were to result, these could have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial results. Such legal proceedings may make it more difficult for us to
	establish and maintain such sites. Furthermore, there are conflicting and confusing reports in the media about the health effects of BTS. These reports have even caused local residents in certain regions to form large protests in strong objection to
	the BTS sites. Such obstacles have made it increasingly difficult to build new BTS sites and maintain our existing sites. In addition, the ICTA is preparing a draft regulation that may lead to a potential change in regulation which further tightens
	electromagnetic field limits. This may negatively impact network quality and increase our capital expenditures.

	Furthermore, there are

	BTS due to health concerns and our inability to obtain the required permission and certificates, may negatively impact the quality of our network, including our ability to expand and upgrade it, and affect our operational performance.

	In addition, municipalities regulate the choice of operators&#146; BTS locations, and if we do not have, or are unable to obtain, a
	construction certificate in our preferred location, we may have to move our BTS to another location. In relation to our fiber business, there is an obligation to get permission for excavations from authorized municipalities or institutions. In some
	areas, excavations may have to be stopped due to the high cost of tariffs requested from municipalities. Our investment plans may be affected due to excavations being banned during certain seasons within the administrative boundaries of
	municipalities. In some cases, we could face the risk that, although we get the approval of the Ministry of Transport, Maritime Affairs and Communications, institutions subordinate to the Ministry do not recognize these approvals and do not give
	permission to excavate. In addition, a new law has increased the number of metropolitan municipalities and in some cases, the size of their territory was increased, which may have the effect of increasing our coverage obligations and the number of
	BTS required to meet them. Furthermore, right of way conflicts with major municipalities to establish fiber optics infrastructure may affect our ability to provide services and to maintain operational excellence. Related regulatory actions in the

	their verdicts (some in our favor, some partially in our favor and partially against us, and some against us). These verdicts are being appealed by the party against which they were rendered and the appeal processes are ongoing. For those cases
	decided against us, interest shall apply at a rate of 2.50 % interest per month for the period between February 15, 2008 and November 18, 2009; 1.95 % interest per month for the period between November 19, 2009 and October 18, 2010 and 1.40 %
	interest per month for the period between October 19, 2010 and the payment date on the principal amount. Accordingly, in the event of an adverse decision in some or all of the cases under dispute, the interest payable could amount to a significant
	portion of the tax assessment and substantially increase our overall liability. In the case that the aforementioned lawsuits finalize against us, no interest shall be calculated on the penalty, on the condition that the payment is made in due time
	after the finalization. While we intend to vigorously defend our rights and our position in this case, no assurance can be given regarding the final outcome. If decided against us, these cases could have a material and adverse effect on our results
	of operations and our financial condition. Currently, we are under tax investigation for the year 2013 and may face investigations in respect of later years, and there is a risk that we may incur a special communication tax and penalties as a result
	of such investigations.

	GSM,
	one&nbsp;of the digital standards for mobile communications, was developed in 1987&nbsp;to facilitate unification and integration of mobile communications worldwide.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	As a digital standard, GSM offers a wide range of services that include voice, circuit switched data, packet data and fax, in addition to
	standard service offerings such as call barring, call forwarding, call waiting and roaming into areas serviced by other GSM carriers. A key component of the GSM network is the simcard, which enables the user of a mobile phone&nbsp;to be identified.
	Simcards, also known as &#147;smart cards&#148;, are placed inside each handset and function as its digital brain. The simcard&#146;s digital memory allows for storage of the subscribers&#146; personal information, such as the rate plan,
	phone&nbsp;number and service features. Both postpaid and prepaid subscribers are required to purchase a simcard in order to use the telecommunications service offered by Turkcell.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	GSM networks have traditionally been used exclusively as personal voice communications networks. Data communication in GSM networks started
	with speeds of 9.6&nbsp;kilobits per second (&#147;Kbps&#148;) and continued to improve with High Speed Circuit Switched Data (&#147;HSCSD&#148;), General Packet Radio Service (&#147;GPRS&#148;) and Enhanced Data rates for GSM Evolution
	(&#147;EDGE&#148;) technologies. Today, GSM networks can provide high-speed wireless data services of up to 300&nbsp;Kbps.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The mobile
	telecommunications industry has increasingly provided mobile data/internet services and used 3G/HSPA+ as a technology platform&nbsp;that is more suitable for data transmission. Currently, many advanced technology platforms are being developed to
	enable the provision of more sophisticated data services.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	In the early 3G networks, the platform&nbsp;was only able to provide network
	speeds up to 384&nbsp;Kbps. By using the new radio access technology, High Speed Downlink Packet Access (&#147;HSDPA&#148;) in UMTS networks, operators gain increased capacity and improved downlink speeds up to 14.4&nbsp;megabits&nbsp;per second
	(&#147;Mbps&#148;). High Speed Packet Access Evolution (&#147;HSPA+&#148;) further enhanced the mobile broadband experience and increased the data capacity of HSPA. HSPA+ enhances mobile broadband with peak rates of 63.3&nbsp;Mbps.

	The latest mobile communications technology available in the commercial networks is 4.5G
	(IMT-Advanced) which is a 4.5G technology relying on All-IP architecture which runs over a currently deployed IP/MPLS Network and offers ultrafast mobile broadband speeds of more than 1000&nbsp;Mbps with latencies of less than 10 ms. 4.5G networks
	have also evolved to offer voice services (VoLTE) and new services like LTE Broadcast (eMBMS). The strategic advantage of an IP-based solution is that having all-IP based infrastructure and services enables operators to deliver a broader, deeper
	communications portfolio&#151;incorporating voice, data and video in addition to other communication services.

	Fiber optics (optical
	fibers) are long, thin strands of very pure glass about the size of a human hair. They are arranged in bundles called optical cables and used to transmit communication signals over long distances. Fiber-optic data transmission systems send
	information over fiber by turning electronic signals into light. Fiber-optic networks have been used for decades to transmit large volumes of traffic. The economics of fiber networks have also allowed for connecting the fiber directly to the home,
	creating a fiber-to-the-home (&#147;FTTH&#148;) network.

	(&#147;Vodafone&#148;) and Turk Telekomunikasyon A.S. (&#147;Turk Telekom&#148; and together with Avea and TTNET, &#147;Turk Telekom Group&#148;). In 2015, the total revenue of the Turkish mobile and fixed markets was TRY 32.8 billion compared to
	TRY 29.9 billion in 2014, according to the operators&#146; announcements (for the calculation of total market revenues, non-group call center revenues are added to Turkcell Turkey&#146;s reported revenue).

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Vodafone entered the Turkish mobile market by acquiring Telsim on May 24, 2006 from the Savings Deposit Insurance Fund (&#147;SDIF&#148;) in
	August 2005. Avea is an operator majority-owned by Turk Telekom Group. Turk Telekom Group is 55% owned by Oger Telecom, a multi-national telecommunications operator 35% owned by Saudi Telecom Company. On April 29, 2015, Turk Telekom Group announced
	that it entered into a share transfer agreement with Is Bankas&#105;, which owns 10.01% of Avea. Following completion of this transaction, Turk Telekom Group became the sole owner of Avea.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	In an effort to create value for our customers,

</B>
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	A key element of our strategy is to expand our range of multiple-play offerings, adding fixed, broadband and
	television customers to deliver a quad-play offering (including mobile, internet, fixed voice and TV) to the Turkish market. In this respect, we launched our IPTV service, &#147;Turkcell TV&#148;, at the end of 2014 and had reached 224 thousand
	subscribers as of December 31, 2015. As a result of the launch of our new offerings, we have grown our share of fiber residential triple-play subscribers (who subscribe to our internet, voice and TV bundles) and mobile triple play subscribers (who
	subscribe to voice, data and strategic services).

	We continued to create value for our customers through our services and solutions which we serve through our superior network. We increased
	our focus on strategic services including BiP, Turkcell Music, Smart Storage, Sports and Turkcell TV+. BiP, our integrated IP-based communication platform, has been downloaded by 4.8 million people; global downloads reached 184 thousand as of
	December 31, 2015. We believe that these services will facilitate our strategies shift from being a telecom operator to a technology services company.&nbsp;We are also seeking to expand in other adjacent business areas in Turkey, such as mobile

	A wide variety of data offers are made available as part of our voice and

	subscribers, which may include the sale of devices by the dealer and/or distributor and a communication service to be provided by us. In particular campaigns, the dealer makes the handset sale to the subscribers whose instalments will be collected
	by us based on the letter of undertaking signed by the subscriber. These campaigns contain a variety of devices such as feature phones, smartphones, 3G modems and tablets. Throughout&nbsp;2015, we maintained our position as leader of handset
	campaigns through our dealer channel and we delivered attractive joint campaigns with &#147;top of the class&#148; models of brands in high demand such as Samsung, Apple, and LG. We have also launched Turkcell-branded T series smartphones and a
	tablet with Android operating systems since 2010, which we believe contributes to increase in smartphone penetration, data usage and further builds customer loyalty by offering a technologically advanced product at a competitive price. The latest
	version of the T-series, the T60, was launched in June 2015 and ranked third in September 2015 in terms of smartphone sales in Turkey according to an independent research company.

	Turkcell intends to provide advantageous price schemes to customers when abroad. With a customer-oriented focus, Turkcell offers products to
	subscribers with high- and low-roaming usage. For subscribers preferring low-usage, Turkcell offers a linear roaming tariff known as the &#147;Turkcell World Tariff&#148;. The subscribers, unless they apply for a specific roaming package, are
	subject to the Turkcell World Tariff when traveling abroad. In January&nbsp;2013, the &#147;Smart Roaming Tariff&#148; was launched. With this tariff, voice/SMS bundle and data-only solutions are offered. The Smart Roaming Tariff activates
	automatically, if and only when, the subscriber makes/receives a call, sends an SMS or uses GPRS. The tariff is activated again after the limits are exceeded. Whenever the subscriber goes abroad again, the tariff is reactivated automatically with
	the first usage unless the subscriber has already opted out. Additionally, Platinum customers enjoy &#147;Super Roaming Campaign&#148; which enables them to use their domestic tariff while abroad by paying a daily fee. Other than the Smart and Super
	Roaming options, Turkcell offers advantageous voice, internet and SMS packages for high-usage levels. Overall, Turkcell aims to provide better roaming experiences with various pricing schemes that fit different usage patterns.

	Mobile churn rate is the&nbsp;percentage of disconnected subscribers calculated by dividing the total number of subscriber disconnections
	during a period by the average number of subscribers for the same period. For these purposes, we define &#147;average number of subscribers&#148; as the number of subscribers at the beginning of the period plus one&nbsp;half of the total number of
	gross subscribers acquired during the period. Churn refers to subscribers that are both voluntarily and involuntarily disconnected from our network. Under our disconnection process, postpaid subscribers who do not pay their bills are disconnected
	and included in churn upon the commencement of a legal process to disconnect them, which commences approximately 180&nbsp;days from the due date of the unpaid bill. Pending disconnection, non-paying subscribers are suspended from service (but are
	still considered subscribers) and receive a suspension warning, which in some cases results in payment and reinstatement of service. Prepaid subscribers who do not reload TRY for a period of 270 days are disconnected (this was changed in
	2010&nbsp;from 210&nbsp;days). Under our churn policy, prepaid subscribers are disconnected from the system if they do not top-up above TRY10 during a nine month period. In the fourth quarter of 2015, 379 thousand subscriptions which were not
	topped-up at all within the stipulated period were disconnected. In&nbsp;2015, the churn rate decreased to 27.3% from 28.3% in 2014, primarily due to churn actions such as voice/data bundle offers based on different customer needs. The fixed churn
	rate also decreased to 16.7% in 2015 from 17.7% in 2014.

	our gross revenue paid to the Turkish Treasury shall be subject to the legal interest rate. If such payments are not duly paid twice in any given&nbsp;year, a penalty in an amount equal to triple the last&nbsp;monthly payment shall be payable to the

	The
	license agreement regulates our ability to determine our tariff for GSM services. The license agreement provides that, after consultation with us and consideration of tariffs applied abroad for similar services, the ICTA sets the initial maximum
	tariffs in Turkish Lira and U.S.&nbsp;Dollars. Thereafter, our license provides that the maximum tariffs shall be adjusted at least every six&nbsp;months. The license agreement provides a formula for adjusting the existing maximum tariffs. For the
	adjustment of the maximum tariffs established in Turkish Lira, the formula is: the Turkish Consumer Price Index announced by the Ministry of Industry and Trade for Turkey minus 3% of the Turkish Consumer Price Index announced by the Ministry of
	Industry and Trade. For the maximum tariffs established in U.S. Dollars, the same method is applied to the USA Consumer Price All Item&nbsp;Index Numbers.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The standard tariffs and the maximum tariffs set by the ICTA have been established in Turkish Lira and the ICTA&#146;s schedule&nbsp;of
	standard tariffs and maximum rates are premised on the TRY/$ Exchange Rate in effect on the date they were approved by the ICTA. Although we believe the tariff structure in our license will, in most instances, permit adjustments designed to offset
	devaluations of the Turkish Lira against the U.S.&nbsp;Dollar, any such devaluation that we are unable to offset will require us to use a larger portion of our revenue to service our non-Turkish Lira foreign currency obligations. Additionally, in
	the event that the ICTA were to establish maximum tariffs at levels below those that would enable us to adjust our rates to offset devaluations, this could have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated financial condition, results of
	operations or liquidity.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	We believe that, pursuant to our license agreement, we can determine our tariffs freely, provided that they
	remain within the framework of the applicable maximum price limit. However, under Article&nbsp;13&nbsp;of the Electronic Communications Law, in the event of determination of the significant market power of the operator, the ICTA may determine the
	lower and upper limit of the tariffs and principles and procedures of the application of the same. Based on such Article, the ICTA may take a similar decision which will have an effect on our future tariffs. With respect to our retail tariffs, in
	the fourth&nbsp;quarter of 2007, the ICTA intervened in our retail prices. Although we challenged that action on the basis that it exceeded the ICTA&#146;s authority under then-applicable law, such action nonetheless had an adverse effect on our
	operational flexibility and our results of operations. With a board resolution dated March&nbsp;25, 2009, the ICTA set a lower limit for solely Turkcell&#146;s on-net retail tariffs. In addition, the ICTA with its board decision dated
	April&nbsp;25,&nbsp;2012&nbsp;decided on the lower limit to be applied to our campaigns (specified offers and packages provided to specific customers for a limited time period)&nbsp;as well as on our tariffs, which further impacted our ability to
	price our services and respond to competitive pressures. Furthermore, with a board resolution dated March&nbsp;13,&nbsp;2013, the ICTA raised the lower limit to be applied on our tariffs to 0.0535&nbsp;TRY/min from

	campaigns from the scope of this decree, which was added in its decision dated April&nbsp;25,&nbsp;2012. The amendments were effective from July&nbsp;2013 onwards. With the same board resolution, the ICTA linked the mobile termination rates to
	minimum on-net voice levels with a parameter of 1.7&nbsp;such that our minimum on-net prices should be set multiplying the mobile termination rate with the above-mentioned parameter of 1.7. In addition, the ICTA with board resolutions dated
	April&nbsp;12,&nbsp;2013 and June&nbsp;17,&nbsp;2013, lowered the mobile termination rates for Turkcell from TRY 0.0170&nbsp;to TRY&nbsp;0.0043&nbsp;for SMS and from TRY 0.0313&nbsp;to TRY 0.0250&nbsp;for voice. As a result, our minimum on-net price
	level has been decreased to TRY 0.0073&nbsp;for SMS and TRY 0.0428&nbsp;for voice due to the above-mentioned parameter. Moreover, with a board resolution dated January&nbsp;6,&nbsp;2014, the ICTA decided to bring the above-mentioned amendment back

	The maximum tariffs set by the ICTA constitute the highest rates we may charge for the services included in
	these customized service packages. Generally, the maximum tariffs set by the ICTA for particular services are set higher than the standard tariffs determined by the ICTA for those services. Although the Concession Agreement includes a provision
	regarding only the increase of the maximum tariffs, the ICTA has decreased the maximum tariff since 2007, which has negatively affected our tariff structure. In 2011, the maximum tariff on SMS decreased by 48% and the maximum tariff on mobile voice
	increased by 4%. In&nbsp;2013, the maximum tariff on mobile voice increased by approximately 6% to TRY 0.439, while as of January&nbsp;2014&nbsp;the maximum tariff on SMS decreased by 20% to TRY 0.332. With a board resolution dated March&nbsp;26,
	2014, price caps for voice increased to 0.4625&nbsp;TRY/min by 5.4% as of July&nbsp;2014. A new board decision dated March 18, 2015, was effective as of April 1, 2015, according to which, maximum tariffs remained the same. Finally, with a board
	decision dated September 28, 2015, which became effective as of November 1, 2015, price caps for voice and SMS remained the same, whereas price caps for some services (e.g. SIM card change, number change etc.) were decreased. The table below shows
	the evolution of maximum tariffs on voice and SMS:

	provide access and to submit their reference offers for access and interconnection to the ICTA for review, and may require amendments to the offers. Operators are obliged to make the amendments requested by the ICTA in a prescribed manner and within
	a prescribed period. In addition, the operators are obliged to publish their reference offers for access and interconnection, which have been approved by the ICTA, and to provide access under the conditions specified in their reference offers and
	interconnection, which have been approved by the ICTA. Please refer to the Interconnection table under the caption &#147;Interconnection Rates&#151;Turkcell, Vodafone, Avea and Turk Telekom&#148; below&nbsp;for the approved interconnection rates. In
	September&nbsp;2011, the ICTA decided that national and international mobile terminating call rates should be differentiated. As a result of this, the ICTA decided that operators could start to set their own rates liberally for international mobile
	terminating calls. As of August&nbsp;2012, Turkcell has started to set its own mobile termination rates for international calls.

	In 2014,
	SMP operators did not provide any reference offers since the ICTA rearranged the current reference offers by itself aiming to make the reference offers aligned. With a board resolution dated October&nbsp;2014, reference offers for interconnection
	operations were announced for Avea, Vodafone&nbsp;and Turkcell. The ICTA has also set the MMS termination rate for all operators that were not previously regulated. We were not obliged to prepare new reference offers for interconnection operations
	in 2015. The ICTA is currently working on market analysis, and access and interconnection reference offers will be updated following the completion of such analysis.

	Design, Set Up and Sharing&#148; on March&nbsp;18, 2011&nbsp;(which abolished the Regulation&nbsp;published on April&nbsp;16, 2008). The Communiqu&eacute; frames antenna facilities design, set up and sharing to enable base station facility usage by
	multiple operators. The emission points will not be determined by operators, therefore operators will have to work cellular planning together. Operators must share every base station facility regardless of tower or building-top distinction. Antenna
	facilities must be set up in certain capacity that at least one&nbsp;more operator can benefit. Some incentives, such as exemptions on some certification fees, will be given if sharing occurs on existing or new sites. Finally, when antenna facility
	set up and sharing requests are evaluated, if the owner of the facility refuses the request, the requesting operator will be informed of the reason for the refusal. This way, negotiation between parties is supported and ICTA involvement is kept at
	minimum levels.

	In the 4.5G Authorization Document, in provinces with population of less than 10.000 and at sites
	to cover highways, double roads and railroads, any new 3G or 4.5G site to be built must be shared actively by all operators within this region. Current government officials declared that research&nbsp;and&nbsp;development (&#147;R&amp;D&#148;) and
	production &amp;&nbsp;development (&#147;P&amp;D&#148;) in Turkey for high-tech products and services will be supported and some incentives will be introduced in the near future. One of the biggest local vendors in the defense industry that is
	already producing telecom equipment for the military declared it is planning to produce a 4.5G&nbsp;base station for commercial networks after 2015. In the 4.5G Authorization Document, usage of locally-produced equipment in network was obliged, with
	rates up to 45%. Yet if the lack of such equipment or absence in the demand for production of such equipment is proved by mobile operators, mobile operators will be free of this obligation specifically for the related term. We informed the ICTA that
	we support any local R&amp;D and P&amp;D, as long as it complies with international technical and financial standards and can be sustainable. However, the 4.5G Authorization Document does not provide details on the compliance with international
	standards. The ICTA may oblige operators to buy and use the locally produced products, independent of the quality standards, if a local vendor produces sufficient equipment to support the mobile operators&#146; demands. This may cause technical
	problems in our network. Should such technical problems occur, it could negatively affect our quality of service, leading to increased costs for the 4.5G&nbsp;infrastructure roll-out and could negatively affect our customer experience.

	2015 was another challenging year for global markets with a further deceleration of activity in key emerging and
	developing economies. The slowdown was accompanied by a further drop in commodity prices and volatility in financial markets. Turkey&#146;s credit rating was kept the same at all three major rating agencies with only Standard &amp;Poor&#146;s still
	remaining one notch below investment grade. The Turkish economy has grown for twenty four quarters in a row and grew by 3.4% in the first nine months of 2015. Based on market estimates, the year-on-year GDP growth in Turkey is expected to be at
	around 3.0% in 2015 and 3.1% in 2016. 2016 is expected to be an even more challenging year globally due to high volatility from differing monetary policies from developed markets. On the U.S. side, the Federal Reserve (&#147;FED&#148;) has increased
	its policy rate for the first time since 2006 with a pickup in economic activity and a strong labor market. The European Central Bank has extended the maturity of its quantitative easing program by at least six months to March 2017 and is expected
	to increase the size of its bond buying program in 2016. The Bank of Japan has introduced negative interest rates for excess reserves for the first time to revive growth and inflation in the world&#146;s third-largest economy. Furthermore, the
	recent drop in oil prices continues to give energy-importing countries like Turkey an opportunity in account rebalancing while increasing the pressure on public finances of energy exporting emerging market countries.

	current account deficit decreased to approximately 4.5% of GDP in the first 11 months of 2015 from approximately 5.7% in 2014. The current account deficit is expected to continue narrowing in 2016 due to low energy prices. Potential capital outflows
	due to a decrease in global USD liquidity and rising U.S. interest rates may have a negative impact on the Turkish economy if not counterbalanced by European Central Bank and Bank of Japan actions.

	Early elections resulted in a single majority government with AKP gaining the majority of the parliament. On a regional level, recent political tensions with Russia and further instability in the CIS, Balkans, Middle East, North Africa and Caucasian
	regions may impact the development of the Turkish economy. Tension in Ukraine, Syria and the Middle East region remain the most important neighboring political risks.

	Turkcell, a joint stock company organized and existing under the laws of the Republic of Turkey, was formed in 1993&nbsp;and
	commenced operations in 1994. We operate under a 25-year GSM license (the &#147;2G&nbsp;License&#148;) and a 20-year GSM license (the &#147;3G License&#148;). We were granted the 2G License in April&nbsp;1998&nbsp;upon payment of an upfront license
	fee of $500&nbsp;million. On April&nbsp;30, 2009, we signed a license agreement with the ICTA, which provides authorization for providing IMT 2000/UMTS services and infrastructure. We acquired the A-type license providing the widest frequency band
	for a consideration of EUR 358&nbsp;million (excluding VAT). The 3G License is effective for 20&nbsp;years starting from April&nbsp;30, 2009. Pursuant to the agreement, we started to provide IMT 2000/UMTS services as of July&nbsp;30, 2009.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Under our 2G License, we pay the Undersecretariat of the Treasury (the &#147;Turkish Treasury&#148;) a&nbsp;monthly treasury share equal to
	15% of our gross revenue. Of such fee, 10% is paid to the Ministry of Transport, Maritime Affairs and Communications of Turkey (&#147;Turkish Ministry&#148;) for the universal service fund.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	We believe that the build-out of our network in Turkey is substantially completed. As of December 31, 2015, our network covered 100% of
	Turkish cities with a population of 1,000&nbsp;or more and the majority of Turkey&#146;s tourist areas and principal intercity highways (according to the Turkish Statistical Institute 2012&nbsp;Census). We currently meet the coverage requirements of
	our 2G&nbsp;license in all material respects.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	In accordance with our 3G license agreement, we are required to cover the population within
	the borders of all metropolitan municipalities and within the borders of all cities and municipalities in three&nbsp;and six&nbsp;years, respectively. Moreover, we are required to cover the population in all settlement areas with a population higher
	than 5,000&nbsp;and 1,000&nbsp;in eight&nbsp;and ten&nbsp;years, respectively, following the date of the agreement. As of December 31, 2015, we had reached 95.0% population coverage.

	In the 4.5G auction held on August 26, 2015, we agreed to purchase the use of 172.4 MHz, the largest amount of spectrum of any operator, for
	&#128;1,623.5 million (excluding VAT and interest payable on the installments). The license fee will be paid in four equal semi-annual installments of &#128;413.8 million (together with interest payable), the first installment being paid the day
	before the signing date of the license together with applicable VAT for the total sum. We agreed to purchase the use of widest frequency bands on 1800 MHz and 2600 MHz. We believe that these will allow us to offer high quality 4.5G services. We
	expect to commence offering 4.5G services from April 1, 2016. The 4.5G License is effective for 13 years until April 30, 2029.

	Other than our 2G, 3G and 4.5G licenses, we also operate under interconnection agreements with
	other operators that allow us to connect our networks with those operators to enable the transmission of calls to and from our mobile communications system through existing digital fixed telephone&nbsp;switches. For example, we have an
	interconnection agreement with Turk Telekom that provides for the interconnection of our network with Turk Telekom&#146;s fixed-line network. Under our agreement with Turk Telekom, as amended, we pay Turk Telekom an interconnection fee per call
	based on the type and length of the call for calls originating on our network and terminating on Turk Telekom&#146;s fixed-line network, as well as fees for other services. We also collect an interconnection fee from Turk Telekom for calls
	originating on their fixed-line network and terminating on ours. We also have interconnection agreements with Vodafone&nbsp;and Avea pursuant to which we have agreed, among other things, to pay interconnection fees to them for calls originating on

	higher package utilization. Our mobile average revenue per user in Turkey increased to TRY 24.5 in 2015 compared to TRY 22.5 in 2014 mainly due to continued strong growth in data usage and an increase in the postpaid subscriber base.

	the period plus one&nbsp;half of the total number of gross subscribers acquired during the period. Churn refers to subscribers that are both voluntarily and involuntarily disconnected from our network. Our churn rate for mobile operations in Turkey

	Total revenues generated by Turkcell International decreased by 24.8%, to TRY 856.1 million in 2015 from TRY 1,137.9 million in 2014 mainly due
	to currency devaluation in Ukraine and Belarus against the Turkish Lira in 2015. The annual growth rates, in terms of local currency, of our major subsidiaries, lifecell and Belarusian Telecom were 10.5% and 6.2% respectively. The revenue growth in
	lifecell, which operates in Ukraine, was mainly driven by the increase in three-month active subscriber base to 10.6 million from 10.3 million and also 2.9% higher blended ARPU (three-month active) due to higher mobile broadband usage. The revenue

	Monetary gain which we recognize from our Belarusian operations increased 15.9%&nbsp;to TRY 205.1 million in 2014 from TRY 176.9 million in
	2013, as a result of an increase in the balance of non-monetary items. The economic environment in Belarus deteriorated significantly starting from the second quarter of 2011 and the three-year cumulative inflation rate exceeded 100% at the end of
	2011. As a result, Belarus was considered a hyperinflationary economy. As a consequence, the accounting rules&nbsp;for &#147;Reporting in hyperinflationary economies&#148; are being applied to our Belarusian operations starting from the year ended
	December&nbsp;31, 2011. With respect to this, monetary gain is recorded as a result of the effect of general inflation and calculated as the difference resulting from the restatement of non-monetary assets, equity and statement of income items.

	VIII. Effects of Inflation
</B>
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The annual inflation rates in Turkey were 8.8%, 8.2% and 7.4% for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively, based on the
	Turkish consumer price index. An increase in unprocessed food and services inflation in addition to pass through effects from TRY depreciation, pushed inflation higher in 2015. The current inflation target set by the CBRT in its February&nbsp;18,
	2016 Inflation Report is 7.5%, with a 70% confidence interval between 6.1% and 8.9% for 2016. The most recent CBRT expectations survey, dated January 14, 2016, indicates that consumer inflation will be around 8.5% by the end of 2016, which is above
	the CBRT&#146;s target. Administrative price hikes introduced at the beginning of year and minimum wage increase both attributed to the negative expectations on inflation in 2016, however the drop in energy prices could offset these effects in up to
	a certain level. For additional information, see &#147;Item 3.A. Selected Financial Data&#151;Exchange Rate Data&#148; and &#147;Item 3.D. Risk Factors&#148;.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Though the inflationary pressures in Belarus improved through 2015, mainly due to BYR devaluation not significantly affecting the food and
	non-food segments, inflation still remained in double digits at the end of 2015. CPI has been gradually moderating since the second quarter of 2015 and fell to 12% at year end from 17.1% in January 2015 amid the Central Bank&#146;s defensive tight
	monetary policy. Despite a slowdown in inflation, tight monetary policy is set to continue due to concerns about external imbalances and currency stability. Macroeconomic stability is still fragile due to the country&#146;s reliance on Russia and
	the Russian economy being challenged by decreasing oil and gas prices. External vulnerability remains a major concern and next year&#146;s financing picture remains challenging due to Russia being the primary source of finance. Given Belarus&#146;
	lowest level of foreign currency reserves since 2011 coupled with the high debt repayments due this year and the current account deficit, and the depreciating Russian Ruble, these factors may create further devaluation and thus inflationary
	pressures.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The fixed exchange rate regime (revised to floating exchange regime in early 2015) and the recession caused a persistent
	deflation in Ukraine. Ukraine experienced deflation until May 2012 when the political and economic tensions with Russia began to escalate and the rise in inflation continued even after the annexation of Crimea in April 2014. After 21 months of
	political instability, annual inflation increased to 43.3% in December 2015 from 25% at the end of 2014. Ukraine has also undergone economic and financial reforms due to the requirements of its financial aid package agreement with IMF. The increase
	in inflation was mainly driven by the services segment of the economy, which doubled due to the IMF agreement on tariff prices hikes while UAH depreciation negatively affected both the food and non-food segments. The inflationary environment is
	expected to normalize to approximately 15-20% in 2016 due to expected economic recovery and currency stability.

	We conduct our business in several currencies other than functional currencies of each of our locations. As a result of our exposure
	to foreign currency, exchange rate fluctuations have a significant impact, in the form&nbsp;of both translation and transaction risks, on our Consolidated Financial Statements.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Exchange rate movements impact our assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than TRY, Ukrainian Hryvnia (&#147;UAH&#148;),
	Belarusian Rubles, Euro and Azerbaijani Manat for our operations in Turkey, Ukraine, Belarus, Germany and Azerbaijan, respectively. We hold some of our cash portfolio in foreign currency to manage our non-TRY denominated liabilities in Turkey.
	Additionally, derivative financial instruments such as forward contracts, swap contracts and options are used.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The foreign exchange risks
	in Turkey as the result of purchases and borrowings in U.S.&nbsp;Dollars and Euros have been manageable, as there is a developed market enabling the hedging of such risk; however, in Belarus and Ukraine, there are no tools to hedge foreign exchange
	rate risks effectively due to restricted and undeveloped financial markets. In Belarus, no international bank offers hedging instruments and local banks are too undercapitalized to be able to enter into transactions.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	In Ukraine, the only hedging tool seemed to be non-deliverable forwards (&#147;NDF&#148;) which is a cash settled product in U.S.&nbsp;Dollar,
	a short term forward contract on a non-convertible foreign currency which could not be delivered offshore. However, with the National Bank of Ukraine forbidding any NDF settlement, the already liquidity-thin market has become virtually non-existent.
	As of December&nbsp;31,&nbsp;2015, following military actions, political instability, civil unrest, the return of the currency to free float and economic problems, the Ukrainian Hryvnia depreciated against the U.S.&nbsp;Dollar by 52.2% in 2015.

	We consider the subtotal after the adjustments for profit for the period in order to analyze the increase in cash from operating activities. Since these lines are adjusting in nature, they are to be excluded from net cash from operating activities,
	as they either do not have any effect on net cash from operating activities or they have an offsetting effect on the changes in working capital. As a result, the trend in cash from operating activities should be correlated with the trend in results
	from operating activities, income tax expense and dividends received. The corresponding subtotal, after adjustments, increased to TRY 4,127.0 million in 2015 from TRY 3,768.0 million in 2014. Furthermore, the increase in interest paid to TRY 153.5
	million in 2015 from TRY 94.1 million in 2014, the increase in the income tax to TRY 751.1 million in 2015 from TRY 699.3 million in 2014 and the increase in change in other current assets had a higher negative impact on cash generated by operating
	activities which partially offset the change in trade receivables, trade payables and other payables. These changes resulted in a 4.5% decrease in net cash provided by our operating activities.

	Net cash used by investing activities increased to TRY 3,830.9 million in 2015 from TRY 1,378.0

	With respect to the interconnection rates that we charge, after a 33%

	With respect to minimum tariffs, with a board resolution dated March&nbsp;25, 2009,
	the ICTA set a lower limit solely for Turkcell&#146;s on-net retail tariffs. In&nbsp;2013, the ICTA linked the mobile termination rates to minimum on-net voice levels with a parameter of 1.7&nbsp;such that our minimum on-net prices should be set by
	multiplying the mobile termination rate with the above mentioned parameter of 1.7. As a result, the ICTA increased the minimum tariff to be applied by Turkcell from TRY 0.0313&nbsp;to TRY&nbsp;0.0428 for voice and to set the minimum tariff of TRY
	0.0073 for SMS, applicable to both tariffs and campaigns. The amendments for tariffs were effective as of July&nbsp;2013 and for campaigns as of February&nbsp;2014. These pricing regulations&nbsp;are valid on each and every single voice tariff and

	With respect to the maximum tariffs, although
	the Concession Agreement includes a provision regarding only the increase of the maximum tariffs, the ICTA has decreased the maximum tariff since 2007, which has negatively affected our tariff structure. The maximum tariff on mobile voice increased
	by approximately 6% to TRY 0.439&nbsp;in 2013 and by approximately 5.4% to 0.4625 as of July 2014, while as of January&nbsp;2014&nbsp;the maximum tariff on SMS decreased by 20% to TRY 0.332. A new board decision dated March 18, 2015 was effective as
	of April 1, 2015; in which maximum tariffs&nbsp;remained the same. Finally, with a board decision dated September 28, 2015 which has been effective as of November 1, 2015; price caps for voice and SMS were remained the same, whereas price caps for

	Our activities have traditionally generated a strong positive cash flow. According to our current business plan for the operations in Turkey,
	we believe that we will be able to finance our current operations, capital expenditures, and financing costs and maintain and enhance our network through our operating cash flow and existing credit facilities and other available credit lines.
	However, we continue to experience difficult pricing and competitive conditions in our markets, which we expect will continue. In addition, the increase in the volume of assigned contracted receivables may continue to result in higher working
	capital requirements. The working capital requirements related to terminal financing and bad debt expenses are planned to be managed by our consumer finance company, which commenced operations in 2016. We are also facing increased capital needs to
	finance our technological and geographic expansion, which may increase our net cash used for investing activities. Furthermore, we are likely to increase our debt if we succeed in our bid to acquire Fintur and TeliaSonera&#146;s direct stake in
	Kcell. These pressures have reduced, and may continue to reduce, our liquidity and may lead to an increase in borrowing needs and net cash used by financing activities.

	Significant factors involved in the process of determining
	compensation and benefits for our employees are our grading structure (based on the Hay Grading system), market movement data and individual performance. We make salary adjustments once&nbsp;yearly. Principal factors in salary adjustments are market
	movements and economic indicators (e.g., the rate of inflation). We pay performance bonuses&nbsp;quarterly to sales employees and annually to all other employees in accordance with individual and company performance results. Our performance
	evaluation system evaluates the whole&nbsp;year performance of our employees through target setting-based on strategic objectives and 360-degree evaluation. Benefits packages are designed in line with the local market practice and linked to grade
	bands/levels where the benefits package improves as the grade band/level increases. We run a flexible benefits plan that allows our employees to select from a pool of choices that suit them such as several shopping and travel vouchers, allowance for
	children and payment to the Defined Contribution Plan (the &#147;DCP&#148;). The DCP is a voluntary pension system in which we and the employee make equal contributions. After a vesting period of three&nbsp;years, the employee gets ownership of the
	contribution we made. The DCP covers all employees who have been working with us for a minimum of six&nbsp;months. As of 2016, a long-term incentive plan will be offered to the management of Turkcell and group companies. The long-term incentive plan
	is subject to company performance measures and linked to our share price performance.

	On March 26, 2015,
	the Ordinary General Assembly of Shareholders approved a dividend distribution for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013 and 2014 amounting to TRY 3,925.0 million (equivalent to $1,535.9 million as of March 26, 2015), which represented
	42.5% of distributable net income for the relevant years. The dividend was paid on April 6, April&nbsp;8 and April 13, 2015 to shareholders, and was funded from cash on hand that we had accrued in light of our inability to receive approvals to pay

	We have adopted a dividend policy, which is included in our Corporate Governance Guidelines. As adopted, our
	general dividend policy is to pay dividends to shareholders with due regard to trends in our operating performance, financial condition and other factors. Since 2004, the Board of Directors has endeavored to distribute cash dividends of at least 50%
	of our distributable net profits per fiscal&nbsp;year, although the payment of dividends remains subject to our cash flow requirements, applicable Turkish laws and the approval of, or amendment by, the Board of Directors and the General Assembly of

	distribution shall be started on a date to be determined by the General Assembly of Shareholders which shall not be later than the end of the&nbsp;year in which the General Assembly convenes. The Company, in accordance with laws and regulations, may
	consider distributing advance dividends or making the dividend payment in equal or unequal installments.

	In accordance with Turkish law, the distribution of profits and the payment of an annual dividend
	with respect to the preceding financial&nbsp;year are subject to a recommendation which may be made by the Board of Directors each&nbsp;year for approval by the shareholders at the annual general assembly. The Board may decide whether or not to
	recommend a distribution of profits together with the amount of dividends, and the shareholders, through the general assembly, may accept, amend or reject such proposal, if any. Dividends are payable on a date proposed by the Board of Directors and
	determined at the general assembly of shareholders, which date, under the CMB requirements, must be earlier than the end of the financial&nbsp;year in which the general assembly decides on dividend distribution. However, the CMB is authorized to

	The new Capital Markets Law, which came into force on
	December&nbsp;30,&nbsp;2012, stipulates that public companies shall distribute dividends in line with their dividend policy determined by their general assembly and in conformity with the relevant legislation. However, the new law entitles the Board
	to regulate dividends. The CMB also published a Communiqu&eacute; on Dividends (II-19.1)&nbsp;on January&nbsp;23,&nbsp;2014&nbsp;and entered into force on February&nbsp;1,&nbsp;2014. Within the scope of the Communiqu&eacute;, companies shall
	distribute dividends through a general assembly resolution in accordance with current legislation and the policies of the company. As per the Communiqu&eacute;, dividends may be distributed in installments in case a general assembly resolution is
	adopted in this regard. The Communiqu&eacute; also sets out the principles and procedures for the distribution of dividends. This new Communiqu&eacute; revoked the Communiqu&eacute; on the Principles Regarding the Distribution of Dividends and

	To the extent we declare dividends in the future, we will pay those dividends in Turkish Lira. In the case of ordinary&nbsp;shares held in the
	form&nbsp;of ADSs, dividends will be converted into U.S.&nbsp;Dollars by the depositary for the ADSs, to the extent it can do so on a reasonable basis, and will be distributed to the holders of the ADSs.&nbsp;Because exchange rates between the
	Turkish Lira and the U.S.&nbsp;Dollar fluctuate continuously, a holder of ADSs&nbsp;will be subject to currency fluctuation generally, but particularly between the date on which dividends are declared and the date dividends are paid. Under current
	Turkish regulations, dividends or other distributions paid in respect of the ordinary&nbsp;shares or ADSs generally will be subject to withholding taxes. See &#147;Item&nbsp;10E.&nbsp;Taxation&#148;.

	According to our Articles&nbsp;of Association, the Board of Directors is comprised of seven&nbsp;members elected by the general assembly. An
	increase in the number of members of the Board of Directors must be approved by the general assembly. However, in a series of resolutions in&nbsp;2013, the CMB appointed new members to our Board, who shall remain members until new members are
	elected or until the CMB announces a new resolution. With the new Turkish Commercial Code Act number 6102&nbsp;(&#147;TCC&#148;), which came into force on July&nbsp;1,&nbsp;2012, the requirement of having a share of company in order to become a
	member of Board of Directors has been abolished. The individuals who do not have any&nbsp;shares in the company have been provided an opportunity to be elected as members of the Board of Directors and carry out such duty. Additionally, the TCC
	mandated that the Board members who have been elected as a representative of a legal entity be required to resign and that the new Board members (as individuals or representatives of the legal entity) be required to be appointed in their place until
	October&nbsp;1,&nbsp;2012&nbsp;at the latest. Currently none&nbsp;of the directors on our Board are either representatives of shareholders that are legal entities or shareholders themselves.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The TCC does not require a Board member to be a Turkish citizen. There is no minimum age for the directors, provided that a Board member has
	reached the age of majority, which is 18, and there is no mandatory retirement age under applicable law. The conditions to be a Board member are regulated by the new TCC and the conditions to be an independent board member are regulated by the
	related CMB legislation.

	Board members and senior management was prepared. This Policy was posted on the company&#146;s website and submitted at the Annual General Assembly as a separate agenda item for information. The Corporate Governance Communiqu&eacute; numbered
	II-17.1, which was published in the Official Gazette dated January&nbsp;3,&nbsp;2014&nbsp;and replaced the Communiqu&eacute; Serial: IV, No: 56, kept this requirement as a mandatory corporate governance principle dealing with Financial Rights of
	Board Members and Executives Having Administrative Responsibility. The Annual General Assembly meeting of our Company pertaining to the years 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013 and 2014 has been convened on March&nbsp;26, 2015. The same item was on the agenda
	for the Annual General Assembly meeting held in 2015 and shareholders have been informed. Payment plans such as stock options or those based on company performance are not used in the remuneration of independent Board members. Remuneration of

	Initially, based on the CMB Communiqu&eacute; Serial&nbsp;IV, No.&nbsp;56, dated December&nbsp;30, 2011,
	the approval of the majority of the independent members was necessary for any and all kinds of related party transactions of the company (related parties referred in the Communiqu&eacute; will be determined in accordance with the Turkish Accounting
	Principles No.&nbsp;24, equivalent of IAS 24), as well as for the resolutions of the board of directors with respect to giving guarantees, pledges and mortgages in favor of third parties. The CMB in a further announcement clarified that listed
	companies could adopt one&nbsp;board/general assembly resolution for the execution of transactions of a continuous and extensive nature with related parties unless the terms of those transactions had changed. In the event such changes occur, new
	board/general assembly resolutions will be needed. The new Capital Markets Law dated December&nbsp;30, 2012&nbsp;empowered the CMB to determine the nature of such transactions. Accordingly, the CMB with its Communiqu&eacute; Serial IV,
	No.&nbsp;63&nbsp;dated February&nbsp;22,&nbsp;2013 restricted the scope and set out that only material related party transactions, as opposed to all kinds of transactions, shall be submitted to the approval of independent members. In cases where the
	majority of the independent members do not approve such material transaction, the case shall be disclosed to the public in a manner covering sufficient information with respect to the transaction within the scope of public disclosure arrangements,
	and the transaction shall be submitted to the general assembly for approval. During such general assembly meetings, a resolution shall be adopted by vote in which the parties to the transaction as well as the individuals related thereto are not
	entitled to vote. Meeting quorum shall not be necessary for the general assembly meetings to be held for those cases. Such resolutions shall be adopted by simple majority of the attendees having the right to vote. The Company&nbsp;shall incorporate
	related mandatory provisions of the said Communiqu&eacute; in its Articles&nbsp;of Association (along with other mandatory provisions relating to corporate governance, see &#147;Item&nbsp;16.G. Corporate Governance&#148;). The Corporate Governance
	Communiqu&eacute; numbered&nbsp;II-17.1, which was published in the Official Gazette dated January&nbsp;3,&nbsp;2014, defined the materiality as set out by the Communiqu&eacute; Serial IV, No.&nbsp;63. Accordingly, a 10% threshold will be applied in
	comparison with the relevant criteria such as total annual assets, annual revenues or market value of the company. When a transaction&#146;s amount is above this 10% threshold, the majority vote of independent board members will be sought.
	Additionally, in order to ensure internal compliance with the CMB&#146;s related party transactions, our Board has adopted the &#147;Rules to be Applied to Related Parties in Purchasing/Selling Assets and Services along with Transfers of
	Liabilities&#148; to be applied by the relevant employees within the company and its group companies on November&nbsp;22, 2014.

	Our Board of Directors has adopted the authorized share capital system which, under Turkish law, allows us to increase our issued share capital
	up to the authorized share capital amount upon resolution by our Board and without need for further shareholder approval. On January&nbsp;23, 2008, the CMB amended its Communiqu&eacute; on principles regarding the registered capital system.
	According to this amendment, the registered capital ceiling authorization given by the CMB shall be valid for five&nbsp;years, including the&nbsp;year in which the authorization is granted. As this five-year term ended in January&nbsp;23,&nbsp;2013,
	as done in 2014, the Company&nbsp;applied for the CMB&#146;s authorization in order to determine its capital ceiling for a five-year term between 2016 and 2020, and will amend its Articles&nbsp;of Association accordingly at the next ordinary general
	assembly meeting, which is expected to be held on March 29, 2016. In an effort to harmonize new legislation with the Capital Markets Law numbered 6362, which entered into force on December&nbsp;30,&nbsp;2012, the CMB released the Communiqu&eacute;
	on the Registered Capital System II-18.1&nbsp;which became effective on December&nbsp;25,&nbsp;2013. The new Communiqu&eacute; mostly includes regulations&nbsp;in line with the former Communiqu&eacute; (Serial: VI, No: 38)&nbsp;and de facto practice
	of the CMB. As for the determination of the ceiling, the new Communiqu&eacute; contemplates a limitation for the ceiling and states that the registered capital ceiling shall not be more than five&nbsp;times the issued capital or the equity,

	registered capital ceiling may be exceeded once within the scope of each ceiling (i)&nbsp;through conversion of all kinds of internal resources and dividends into the share capital; and
	(ii)&nbsp;as a result of transactions requiring general assembly resolutions such as mergers and spin-offs. However, both the former legislation and the new Communiqu&eacute; provide that the registered capital ceiling may not be exceeded with
	capital increases through cash. As in the former regime, the registered capital ceiling approved by the CMB is valid for five&nbsp;years including the&nbsp;year in which the approval is granted. Upon the expiry of the term, even if the registered
	capital ceiling has not been reached, in order for the board of directors to adopt a capital increase resolution, the board of directors must obtain authorization for a new period at the first general assembly upon the approval of the CMB for the
	same ceiling or a new ceiling. The term of this authorization may be extended for five&nbsp;year periods through a general assembly resolution. In the event such authorization is not obtained, the new Communiqu&eacute; emphasizes that companies may
	not realize a capital increase through a board of directors&#146; resolution, whereas under the former Communiqu&eacute;, companies were deemed to be excluded from the registered capital system. The increase of the registered capital ceiling,
	extension of the permission period, capital increase and relevant resolutions of the board of directors shall be disclosed to the public within the framework of the CMB disclosure rules.

	We may increase our capital only through the issuance of new&nbsp;shares, and such issuances may come in the form&nbsp;of a rights offering or
	a bonus issue. Under Turkish law, existing shareholders are entitled to subscribe for new&nbsp;shares, also known as preemption rights, in proportion to their respective shareholdings each time we undertake a capital increase. Our Board of Directors
	will generally recommend that new&nbsp;shares be issued at prices equal to their nominal value, which entitles the existing shareholders to subscribe for&nbsp;shares at a significant discount from their current market price. The exercise of
	preemption rights by shareholders must be made within a subscription period which we announce, which may not be less than 15 days nor more than 60 days after the issuance of the preemption rights circular. Shareholders who do not wish to subscribe
	for new&nbsp;shares may sell their rights on the Borsa Istanbul (&#147;BIST&#148;). Any&nbsp;shares not subscribed for by the existing shareholders or purchasers of the rights coupons are sold on the BIST at the current market price. Any differences
	between the rights issue price and the price realized for the&nbsp;shares on the BIST would accrue to our surplus account. Preemption rights of shareholders related to a rights offering may be restricted wholly or in part&nbsp;either by an
	affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding&nbsp;shares at an ordinary or extraordinary general assembly or a resolution adopted by the Board of Directors to such effect, provided that such authority is conferred upon the Board
	of Directors. CMB rules&nbsp;stipulate that such authority may be conferred upon the Board of Directors of companies that have received permission from the CMB to adopt the authorized capital system. As per the new Communiqu&eacute; on the
	Registered Capital System II-18.1, the General Assembly shall approve the amendments to the articles&nbsp;of association with respect to granting authorization to the board of directors to restrict the pre-emptive rights of the shareholders to
	acquire new&nbsp;shares. Contrary to the former Communiqu&eacute;, the new Communiqu&eacute; has not foreseen a meeting quorum. With regard to the decision quorum, the former Communiqu&eacute; differentiated between companies making an initial
	public offering and public companies, whereas the new Communiqu&eacute; has not stipulated any such distinction. Accordingly, the new Communiqu&eacute; regulates that shareholders holding 2/3&nbsp;of the&nbsp;shares having voting rights shall
	provide affirmative votes. In addition, the new Communiqu&eacute; has prescribed that if at least shareholders holding half of the voting&nbsp;shares are present at the meeting, the decision quorum shall be the majority of the&nbsp;shares
	participating in the meeting.

	By the amendment to the Articles&nbsp;of Association, we have conferred such authority on our Board of
	Directors. The CMB further requires that the right of the Board of Directors to restrict the preemption rights of shareholders applies equally with respect to all shareholders. Under Turkish law, bonus issues may be undertaken in order to convert
	all or a portion of the revaluation fund and reserves of a company into share capital.

	The Turkish Regulation&nbsp;on public disclosure of listed companies was regulated by the CMB Communiqu&eacute; Serial VIII,
	No.&nbsp;54&nbsp;on Principles Regarding Public Disclosure of Material Events dated February&nbsp;2009. The CMB released a new Communiqu&eacute; on Public Disclosure of Material Events (II-15.1)&nbsp;which was published in the Official Gazette dated
	January&nbsp;23,&nbsp;2014, numbered 28891, which entered into force on February&nbsp;23,&nbsp;2014. Insider information, which means any non-public information that may possibly affect the value of capital market instruments and investors&#146;
	decisions, is required to be disclosed immediately by listed companies. Shareholders&#146; disclosure requirement would arise if they exceed the shareholding ratios established in the Communiqu&eacute;&nbsp;II-15.1&nbsp;(5%, 10%, 15%, 20%, 25%, 33%,
	50%, 67% and 95%). Disclosure of insider information may be delayed to protect the legitimate interests of the company without causing market manipulation. For those that have administrative responsibilities in Turkcell (including Board members and
	high-ranked executives), or are closely related persons, that purchase and sell Turkcell&#146;s capital market instruments (including, but not limited to, Turkcell&nbsp;shares), such transactions will need to be declared to the Borsa Istanbul;
	however, according to the Communiqu&eacute; II-15.1, if the cumulative amount of the above-mentioned Turkcell transactions does not exceed TL 50,000, such declaration will not be needed (TL&nbsp;100,000 for the company&#146;s securities other than
	shares). This upper limit represents the total amount of all transactions made by both Board members/high-ranked executives and their closely related persons of the company and that of its subsidiaries which represent more than 10% of the total
	assets according to the latest annual financial statements of the company. &#147;Closely related persons&#148; means: wives/husbands, children and individuals sharing the same residence at the time of transaction and corporations; legal entities run
	by, directly/indirectly controlled by or whose economic interests are similar with that of Board members; and high-ranked executives of the Company. The CMB by its decision dated June&nbsp;27, 2014 issued new guidelines for the announcement of
	material events for public companies based on Article&nbsp;27 of the Communiqu&eacute; II-15.1, thus repealing the old guidance which was prepared in conformity with the Communiqu&eacute; Serial VIII, No:54.

	Markets Law Article&nbsp;103/4&nbsp;and indicates that (i)&nbsp;the board members and the committee members of an issuer, (ii)&nbsp;the persons with administrative responsibilities at the issuer and (iii)&nbsp;the persons that have the power to
	determine and control the issuer&#146;s financial and operational policies, decisions or targets directly or indirectly, shall pay the net gains they have obtained through the purchases and sales within the same six-month period. It is indicated in
	the Communiqu&eacute; VI 103.1&nbsp;that the purpose of this regulation&nbsp;is to remove the inequality of opportunity between the persons who receive insider information about the issuers easier and faster due to their positions and the investors
	that reach the insider information after public disclosure.

	Communiqu&eacute; Serial IV No.&nbsp;44&nbsp;also stipulates certain circumstances which will not trigger a mandatory offer, such as management control changes of the company by a voluntary tender offer and share transfers by privileged shareholders

	January&nbsp;23,&nbsp;2014, numbered 28891, which entered into force on the date of its publication. Through the Communiqu&eacute;, the procedures and principles regarding mandatory and voluntary tender offers as a result of a change in management
	control have been regulated in compliance with the new Capital Markets Law No.&nbsp;6362. Moreover, the definition of management control has been regulated as the direct or indirect acquisition of more than 50% of the share capital or the voting
	rights individually or collectively. Holding more than fifty percent of the voting rights of a corporation directly or indirectly, alone or jointly with persons acting in concert, or regardless of such percentage, holding privileged shares enabling
	their holder to elect a simple majority of the total number of the members of the board of directors or to nominate for the said number of directors in the general assembly meeting, is considered and treated as an acquisition of control.

	The Communiqu&eacute; on Tender Offer (II-26.1) was modified on February&nbsp;27, 2015 and the following situation has been added amid cases
	where a mandatory tender offer will not be triggered. Following the purchase by a third party of a portion of the shares of a controlling shareholder, on the condition that this third party has 50% or less of voting rights of the company, should
	such third party share equally or less than the management control of the company with this controlling shareholder by virtue of a written agreement, this situation is not considered a trigger for a mandatory tender offer for this third party.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	In parallel, the Capital Markets Law No. 6362 introduces a squeeze-out right: in the event the shareholding of a shareholder reaches a
	threshold, which shall be determined by secondary legislation of the CMB, such shareholder shall have the right to purchase&nbsp;the shares of the minority shareholders and the minority shall have the right to sell their&nbsp;shares. The CMB
	released the Communiqu&eacute; on Squeeze-Out Rights and Statutory Put Option Rights (II-27.1)&nbsp;on January&nbsp;2,&nbsp;2014&nbsp;in the Official Gazette numbered 28870, which became effective as of July&nbsp;1,&nbsp;2014. This Communiqu&eacute;
	was replaced with the Communiqu&eacute; II-27.2 which entered into force upon its publication in the Official Gazette dated November&nbsp;12, 2014 and numbered 29173 (the &#147;new Communiqu&eacute;&#148;). According to the Communiqu&eacute;
	II-27.1, if the controlling shareholder, directly or indirectly, holds at least 95% of the voting rights in a public company as a result of a mandatory tender offer or by any other means, the controlling shareholder has the right to squeeze out all
	other shareholders regardless of whether they hold privileged&nbsp;shares. As per the new Communiqu&eacute;, in the event that a shareholder holds at least 98% of the voting rights in a public company either as a result of a mandatory tender offer
	or by any other means, or if the controlling shareholder already satisfying this threshold acquires an additional share, the controlling shareholder will be entitled to the right to squeeze-out all other shareholders. Once the squeeze-out right
	arises, the remaining minority shareholders will be entitled to the right to sell-out their shares. The new Communiqu&eacute; also stipulates a transition period. Accordingly, the threshold of 95% shall continue to apply to squeeze-out rights that
	arose before December 31, 2014 and a new threshold of 97% shall apply to squeeze-out rights that will arise thereafter until December&nbsp;31, 2017. The new Communiqu&eacute; regulates the squeeze-out and the put option rights under the same
	provision. Accordingly, the controlling shareholder is obliged to make a public disclosure, if and when the controlling shareholders&#146; shareholding ratio reaches at least 98% of the voting rights or acquires additional shares to enhance its
	status. The remaining minority shareholders are entitled to exercise their sell-out rights within three&nbsp;months following the public disclosure. The three-month period is statutory and the sell-out rights of the minority shareholders shall
	expire at the end of such period. The minority shareholder willing to exercise its sell-out right shall notify the public company in writing of its request. The board of directors shall procure the preparation of a valuation report in order to
	determine the purchase price for the minority shares within one&nbsp;month upon the sell-out request. Upon application of the controlling shareholder for exercising the squeeze-out right, and approval of the board of directors about the fulfillment
	of the conditions for exercising the squeeze-out right, the company shall apply to the CMB for issuance of new shares to replace the cancelled ones. A delisting application to the relevant stock exchange is also required. All payment and settlement
	transactions shall be conducted via the Central Registration Agency. The controlling shareholder shall deposit the share purchase amount to the company&#146;s account, within three&nbsp;business days following the notification made by the company at
	the latest, and the company shall transfer such amount to the relevant minority shareholders&#146; account on the second succeeding business day to complete the share transfer transactions. As for the calculation of the purchase price, the purchase
	price during exercising of the squeeze-out right shall be equivalent to the average of the weighted daily stock market price within the 30-day period prior to the disclosure stating that the controlling shareholder has reached at least 98% of the
	voting rights or acquired additional shares for traded shares. The Communiqu&eacute; refers to a &#147;fair price&#148; for the exercise of the sell-out right. Accordingly, (i)&nbsp;the price determined for the squeeze-out right; (ii)&nbsp;the price
	determined per each share group through a valuation report; (iii)&nbsp;the price of a mandatory tender offer within the&nbsp;year preceding the public disclosure of control, if any; and (iv)&nbsp;the average of the weighted average prices on the
	exchange pertaining to the previous six&nbsp;months, previous&nbsp;year and previous five&nbsp;years shall be compared. The highest value shall be determined as the purchase price when the sell-out right is

	We currently believe that we were not a passive foreign investment company (a &#147;PFIC&#148;) for U.S.&nbsp;federal income tax purposes for
	the taxable&nbsp;year ending December 31, 2015. However, this conclusion is a factual determination that must be made annually and thus may be subject to change. A non-U.S.&nbsp;corporation will be classified as a PFIC for any taxable&nbsp;year if
	at least 75% of its gross income consists of passive income (such as dividends, interest, rents, royalties or gains on the disposition of certain minority interests), or at least 50% of the average value of its assets consists of assets that
	produce, or are held for the production of, passive income. If we were characterized as a PFIC for any taxable&nbsp;year, you would suffer adverse tax consequences. These consequences may include having gains realized on the disposition
	of&nbsp;shares or ADSs treated as ordinary income rather than capital gains, and being subject to punitive interest charges on certain dividends and on the proceeds of the sale or other disposition of the&nbsp;shares or ADSs. Furthermore, dividends
	paid by a PFIC would not be &#147;qualified dividend income&#148; (as discussed above)&nbsp;and would be taxed at the higher rates applicable to other items of ordinary income. You should consult your own tax advisor regarding the potential

	To manage and
	hedge our foreign exchange risk more effectively, we may enter into forward transactions and option contracts and currency swap contracts. In addition, in order to take advantage of market volatility in the foreign exchange markets and increase the
	yield on our free cash, we may enter into option transactions to buy or sell certain currencies, allowing us to mitigate our exposure to negative foreign exchange rate swings. As of December 31, 2015 we had outstanding EUR/USD currency swap
	contracts with notional of &#128;457 million and maturity as of January 4, 2016 and USD/TL currency forward with notional of $57.7 million and maturity as of January 4, 2016. The basis for our sensitivity analysis to measure foreign exchange risk is
	an aggregate corporate-level currency exposure. The aggregate foreign exchange exposure is composed of all our assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies. This analysis excludes net foreign currency investments. It is estimated that a
	general increase of 10% in the value of TRY, Ukrainian Hryvnia and Belarusian Rubles, against other foreign currencies, would have decreased our profit before income tax by approximately TRY559.3&nbsp;million for the&nbsp;year ended December 31,

	Internal control over financial reporting has inherent limitations. It is a process that involves human diligence and
	compliance and is subject to lapses in judgment and breakdowns resulting from human failures. In addition, it can be circumvented by collusion or improper management override. Because of such limitations, there is a risk that material misstatements
	will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis by internal controls over financial reporting. However, these inherent limitations are known features of the financial reporting process. Therefore, it is possible to design safeguards to reduce,

	In addition, corporate governance practices in Turkey are also guided by the Corporate Governance Principles of the CMB (the &#147;CMB
	Principles&#148;), which took effect on a &#147;comply or explain&#148; basis on January&nbsp;1, 2004. Effective from 2005, the CMB requires listed companies to incorporate in their annual reports a &#147;Corporate Governance Compliance Report&#148;
	which compares the CMB Principles to the Corporate Governance principles under which the Company&nbsp;operates. This report is posted on our website, www.turkcell.com.tr.

	Effective in 2011, by way of various communiqu&eacute;s, the CMB revised its corporate governance principles with a view to strengthening the
	governance practices of listed companies. As a result, the CMB left the &#147;comply or explain&#148; approach to a limited extent and required listed companies to comply with certain corporate governance principles on a compulsory basis by
	June&nbsp;30,&nbsp;2012. In a further Communiqu&eacute; dated September&nbsp;13,&nbsp;2012, the CMB empowered itself, effective until December&nbsp;31,&nbsp;2012, to take legal action before the relevant first instance court in a view to assure
	compliance with its corporate governance rules. No legal action has been taken there against our Company&nbsp;to the best of our knowledge. The new Capital Markets Law came into force on December&nbsp;30,&nbsp;2012. The Capital Markets Board is
	entitled by Article 17/2&nbsp;to make decisions and perform&nbsp;actions accordingly on its own initiative in case time-bound compliance requirements relating to its corporate governance principles are not met in due time.

	Turkcell Iletisim Hizmetleri Anonim Sirketi (the &#147;Company&#148;)
	was incorporated in Turkey on 5&nbsp;October 1993 and commenced its operations in 1994. The address of the Company&#146;s registered office is Maltepe Aydinevler Mahallesi Inonu Caddesi No: 20, Kucukyali Ofispark / Istanbul. It is engaged in
	establishing and operating a Global System for Mobile Communications (&#147;GSM&#148;) network in Turkey and regional states.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; MARGIN-LEFT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	In April
	1998, the Company signed a license agreement (the &#147;2G License&#148;) with the Ministry of Transport, Maritime Affairs and Communications of Turkey (the &#147;Turkish Ministry&#148;), under which it was granted a 25&nbsp;year GSM license in
	exchange for a license fee of $500,000. The License permits the Company to operate as a stand-alone GSM operator and releases it from some of the operating constraints in the Revenue Sharing Agreement, which was in effect prior to the 2G License.
	Under the 2G License, the Company collects all of the revenue generated from the operations of its GSM network and pays the Undersecretariat of Treasury (the &#147;Turkish Treasury&#148;) a treasury share equal to 15% of its gross revenue from
	Turkish GSM operations. The Company continues to build and operate its GSM network and is authorized to, among other things, set its own tariffs within certain limits, charge peak and off-peak rates, offer a variety of service and pricing packages,
	issue invoices directly to subscribers, collect payments and deal directly with subscribers. Following the 3G tender held by the Information Technologies and Communications Authority (&#147;ICTA&#148;) regarding the authorization for providing
	IMT-2000/UMTS services and infrastructure, the Company has been granted the A-Type license (the &#147;3G License&#148;) providing the widest frequency band, at a consideration of EUR 358,000 (excluding Value Added Tax (&#147;VAT&#148;)). Payment of
	the 3G license was made in cash, following the necessary approvals, on 30&nbsp;April 2009.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; MARGIN-LEFT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	On 26&nbsp;August 2015, &#147;Authorization
	Tender on IMT Services and Infrastructure&#148; publicly known as 4.5G license tender, was held by the ICTA and the Company was awarded with a total frequency band of 172.4&nbsp;MHz for 13 years. The tender price is EUR 1,623,460 (equivalent to TL
	5,158,706 as at 31&nbsp;December 2015) (excluding VAT of 18%). IMT authorization period expires on 30&nbsp;April 2029 and operators will be able to commence service delivery for 4.5G starting from 1&nbsp;April 2016. 2x1.4 MHz frequency band in
	900MHz spectrum and 2 units of 2x5 MHz frequency bands in 2100 MHz spectrum are commenced as at 1&nbsp;December 2015, remaining packages will be ready to use on 1&nbsp;April 2016. For details please refer to Note&nbsp;14.

	On 25&nbsp;June 2005, the Turkish Government declared that GSM operators are required to pay 10% of their existing monthly treasury share to
	the Turkish Ministry as a universal service fund contribution in accordance with Law No: 5369. As a result, starting from 30&nbsp;June 2005, the Company pays 90% of the treasury share to the Turkish Treasury and 10% to the Turkish Ministry as
	universal service fund.

	economy is still expected to continue contracting while vulnerabilities to external developments remain. In December 2015, Belarusian Statistics Office announced that GDP contracted by 3.9% in 2015. Contraction in economy resulted from weak economic
	activity in Russia, weak domestic demand and devaluation in BYR along with tight monetary stance. National Bank of the Republic of Belarus (&#147;NBRB&#148;) raised its refinancing rate to 25% in January 2015 with worsening expectations for the
	Russian economy. BYR depreciated by 25% throughout 2014 and 57% in 2015 against USD and finished the year at 18,569 on 31&nbsp;December 2015. BYR rate against USD stood at 20,985 as of 10&nbsp;March 2016.Tight monetary policy is still seen necessary
	because of weak domestic demand and foreign exchange rate concerns. Foreign exchange reserves excluding gold and IMF money (SDR) have decreased by $0.65 million to $2.2 million within 2015 and decreased by another $0.33 million to $1.9 million at
	the end of February 2016. Belarus repaid $6 million of internal and external foreign currency debt in 2015. On the other hand, Russia&#146;s postponing payments of loans maturing in 2015 and allowing payments to be made in Russian Ruble rather than
	USD led external debt repayments to be made in 2015 decrease from $4 million to $2.7 million. RMB swap agreement made with the Chinese Central Bank also strengthened Belarus&#146;s debt repayment ability. Annual inflation for the year 2015 decreased
	to 12%, the lowest level for the last four years. In spite of the devaluation in BYR since 2014, inflationary pressures are expected to ease over the medium term due to Central Bank policies prioritizing the fight against inflation.

	The three-year cumulative inflation at the end of 2011 was 153% primarily influenced by the high inflation of 109% experienced in 2011. As the
	cumulative inflation in the last three years exceeded 100%, Belarus was considered a hyperinflationary economy at the end of 2011. In this context, IAS 29 &#147;Financial Reporting in Hyperinflationary Economies&#148; was being applied by
	subsidiaries operating in Belarus in financial statements starting from their annual financial statements for the year ending 31&nbsp;December 2011. However, decrease in inflation rate in subsequent years led the three-year cumulative rate as of the
	end of 2014 to decrease to 65% (31 December 2015: 52%). Accordingly, the economy of Belarus was considered to transit out of hyperinflationary status determined to cease applying IAS 29 starting from 1&nbsp;January 2015. Therefore, subsidiaries
	operating in Belarus have not applied IAS 29 in 2015.

	is not appropriate for property, plant and equipment, and introduces a rebuttable presumption that an amortisation method that is based on the revenue generated by an activity that includes the use of an intangible asset is inappropriate, which can
	only be overcome in limited circumstances where the intangible asset is expressed as a measure of revenue, or when it can be demonstrated that revenue and the consumption of the economic benefits of the intangible asset are highly correlated. The
	amendment also adds guidance that expected future reductions in the selling price of an item that was produced using an asset could indicate the expectation of technological or commercial obsolescence of the asset, which, in turn, might reflect a
	reduction of the future economic benefits embodied in the asset.

	definitive agreement on tax assessments. Companies file their tax returns&nbsp;at the end of&nbsp;April following the close of the accounting year to which they relate. Tax authorities may, however, examine such returns and the underlying accounting
	records and may revise assessments within five years. Advance tax returns are filed on a quarterly basis.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; MARGIN-LEFT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Corporate tax is applied on
	taxable corporate income, which is calculated from the statutory accounting profit by adding back non-deductible expenses, and by deducting&nbsp;tax exempt income.

	In Turkey, the transfer pricing provisions have been stated under the Article 13 of Corporate Tax Law with the heading of &#147;disguised
	profit distribution via transfer pricing&#148;. The General Communiqu&eacute; on disguised profit distribution via Transfer Pricing, dated 18&nbsp;November 2007 sets details about implementation.

	If a taxpayer enters into transactions regarding sale or purchase of goods and services with related parties, where the prices are not set in
	accordance with arm&#146;s length principle, then related profits are considered to be distributed in a disguised manner through transfer pricing. Such disguised profit distributions through transfer pricing are not accepted as tax deductible for
	corporate income tax purposes.

	B.M. (&#147;Azercell&#148;), a 51% owned consolidated subsidiary of Fintur, was completed. The non-controlling shareholders in Azercell acquired the 35.7% shares of Republic of Azerbaijan increasing their effective ownership in Azercell to 49%. At

	The following tables detail the Group&#146;s remaining contractual maturity for its financial
	liabilities with agreed repayment periods. The tables have been drawn up based on the undiscounted cash flows of financial liabilities based on the earliest date on which the Group can be required to pay. The tables include both interest and
	principal cash flows. To the extent that interest flows are floating rate, the undiscounted amount is derived from interest rate curves at the end of the reporting period. The contractual maturity is based on the earliest date on which the Group may
	be required to pay.

	On
	27&nbsp;April 1998, the Company signed the Agreement for grant of concession for the establishment and Operation of the Pan-European Mobile Telephone System, GSM (hereinafter&nbsp;referred to as the &#147;License Agreement&#148;) with the Turkish
	Ministry. In accordance with the License Agreement, the Company was granted a 25 year license for the provision of GSM services&nbsp;for a license fee of $500,000. The License Agreement permits the Company to operate as a stand-alone GSM operator.
	Under the License, the Company collects all of the revenue generated from the operations of its GSM network and pays the Turkish Treasury a treasury share and universal service fund, respectively, equal to 15% of its gross revenues from Turkish GSM
	operations. In February 2002, the GSM License of the Company was renewed under provisions of the new License Agreement signed with the ICTA and in accordance with the License Agreement, the Company became obliged to pay 0.35% of its yearly gross
	revenue once a year as ICTA Fee. Moreover on 25&nbsp;June 2005, the Turkish government declared that GSM operators are required to pay 10% of their existing monthly treasury share to the Turkish Ministry as a universal service fund contribution in
	accordance with Law No: 5369. As a result, starting from 30&nbsp;June 2005, the Company pays 90% of the treasury share to the Turkish Treasury and 10% to the Turkish Ministry as universal service fund. The Company is authorized to, among other
	things, set its own tariffs within certain limits, charge peak and off-peak rates, offer a variety of service and pricing packages, issue invoices directly to subscribers, collect payments and deal directly with subscribers.
