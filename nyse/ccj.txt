	Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures
</I>
</B>
	. As of the end of the period covered
	by this report, an evaluation of the effectiveness of Cameco Corporation&#146;s &#147;disclosure
	controls and procedures&#148; (as such term is defined in Rules&nbsp;13a-14(c) and 15d-14(c) of the
	United States Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the &#147;Exchange Act&#148;)) was carried out by
	Cameco Corporation&#146;s Chief Executive Officer (&#147;CEO&#148;) and Chief Financial Officer (&#147;CFO&#148;).
	Based on that evaluation, the CEO and CFO have concluded that as of such date Cameco
	Corporation&#146;s disclosure controls and procedures are effective to ensure that information
	required to be disclosed by Cameco Corporation in reports that it files or submits under
	the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods
	specified in United States Securities and Exchange Commission rules and forms.

	It should be noted that while the CEO and CFO believe that Cameco Corporation&#146;s disclosure
	controls and procedures provide a reasonable level of assurance that they are effective,
	they do not expect that the disclosure controls and procedures or internal controls over
	financial reporting will prevent all errors and fraud. A control system, no matter how well
	conceived or operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the
	objectives of the control system are met.

	Cameco Corporation revised the accounting for the non-routine
	and complex restructuring transactions that helped create Centerra Gold Inc., resulting in
	a restatement of the previously issued interim financial statements for the periods ended
	June&nbsp;30, 2004 and September&nbsp;30, 2004. The original accounting for these transactions had
	been carefully analyzed and assessed by management and reviewed by Cameco Corporation&#146;s
	independent public accountants.

	The change to the accounting for the restructuring transactions resulted from a final
	review in the course of preparing the year-end audited financial statements, when a decision
	was reached by management and Cameco Corporation&#146;s independent public accountants that a
	more appropriate basis of accounting for the transactions existed. Cameco Corporation has
	concluded that the use of a less appropriate method of accounting could be deemed to be the
	result of a significant deficiency in the design or operation of its internal controls
	regarding the application of generally accepted accounting principles and the review process
	of the implementation of accounting guidance.

	In reassessing the practice that ultimately led to the change in accounting with respect to
	the restructuring transactions for Centerra Gold Inc., Cameco Corporation has determined
	that a corporate policy is required to formalize the current practice with respect to the
	review, assessment and conclusion on the accounting treatment for non-routine or complex
	transactions, changes in accounting policy and accounting decisions that involve significant
	application of professional judgment. This policy will include:

	anticipates, &#147;expects&#148;, &#147;estimates&#148; and words of similar import may indicate forward-looking
	statements. Statements which are not historical facts are forward-looking statements that involve
	risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from
	those expressed or implied by forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause such
	differences, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, include: volatility and sensitivity
	to market prices for uranium, conversion services, electricity in Ontario and gold; the impact of
	the change in volume of uranium and conversion services sold, electricity generated by Bruce Power
	LP, and gold produced by Centerra Gold Inc.; the financial results and operations of Bruce Power LP
	and Centerra Gold Inc.; competition; the impact of change in foreign currency exchange rates and
	interest rates; imprecision in reserve, decommissioning, and reclamation estimates; adverse mining
	conditions; unexpected geological or hydrological conditions; operating performance and life of the
	facilities; unplanned outages or planned outages that extend beyond the scheduled period at Bruce
	Power LP&#146;s facilities; environmental and safety risks including increased regulatory burdens and
	long term hazardous waste disposal; political risks arising from operating in certain developing
	countries; a possible deterioration in political support for nuclear energy; changes in government
	regulations and policies, including tax and trade laws and policies; demand for nuclear power;
	replacement of production and failure to obtain necessary permits and approvals from government
	authorities; legislative and regulatory initiatives regarding deregulation, re-regulation or
	restructuring of the electric utility industry in Ontario; Ontario electricity rate regulations;
	weather and other natural phenomena; ability to maintain and improve positive labour relations;
	success of planned development projects; and other development and operating risks. Although
	Cameco believes the assumptions inherent in forward-looking statements are reasonable, undue
	reliance should not be placed on these statements, which only apply as of the date of this Annual
	Information Form. Cameco disclaims any intention or obligation to update or revise any
	forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future developments or

	NOTE REGARDING RESERVES AND RESOURCES
</B>
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	Reserves and resources reported herein have been estimated as at December&nbsp;31, 2004 in
	accordance with definitions adopted by the Canadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy and Petroleum
	and incorporated into National Instrument 43-101 (see &#147;Definitions&#148; below). Estimates of uranium
	reserves and resources were prepared by or under the supervision of the qualified persons
	identified at &#147;Uranium Concentrates Business &#150; Reserves and Resources&#148;. Estimates of gold reserves
	and resources were prepared by or under supervision of the qualified persons identified at
	&#147;Centerra Gold Inc. &#150; Reserves and Resources.&#148; Cameco reports reserves and resources separately.
	The amount of reported resources does not include those amounts identified as reserves.
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	Cameco reports its reserves and resources in accordance with National Instrument 43-101, as
	required by Canadian securities regulatory authorities. For United States reporting purposes,
	Industry Guide 7 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (as interpreted by the Staff of the U.S.
	Securities and Exchange Commission) applies different standards in order to classify mineralization
	as a reserve. Accordingly, for U.S. reporting purposes, as at December&nbsp;31, 2004, the
	mineralization at the Ruth uranium in situ leach project in Wyoming is classified as mineralized
	material. In addition, for U.S. reporting purposes, all mineral resources must be considered as
	mineralized material.

	For the purpose of estimating uranium reserves in accordance with National Instrument 43-101 of the
	Canadian securities regulatory authorities, a uranium price of $21.80 (US)&nbsp;was used. For the
	purpose of estimating reserves in accordance with United States Securities and Exchange
	Commission&#146;s Industry Guide 7 for US reporting purposes, a uranium price of $13.40 (US)&nbsp;was used.
	Estimated uranium reserves are the same using either uranium price, except for the Ruth uranium in
	situ leach project in Wyoming which, for US reporting purposes, is classified as mineralized
	material.
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	For the purpose of estimating gold reserves in accordance with National Instrument 43-101 of the
	Canadian securities regulatory authorities, reserves were calculated with a cut-off grade based on
	a gold price of $375 (US)&nbsp;per ounce. For the purpose of estimating gold reserves in accordance with
	United States Securities and Exchange Commission&#146;s Industry Guide 7 for US reporting purposes,
	reserves were calculated with a cut-off grade based on a gold price of $350 (US)&nbsp;per ounce. At the
	lower gold price, on a 100% basis, Kumtor reserves decrease by 1,772,000 tonnes of ore (4%) and
	109,000 ounces of contained gold (3%) and Boroo reserves decrease by 530,000 tonnes of ore (4%) and
	17,400 ounces of contained gold (1%).

	Mineral resources are not mineral reserves and do not have demonstrated economic viability, but do
	have reasonable prospects for economic extraction. Measured and indicated mineral resources are
	sufficiently well defined to allow geological and grade continuity to be reasonably assumed and
	permit the application of technical and economic parameters in assessing the economic viability of
	the resources. Inferred resources are estimated on limited information not sufficient to verify
	geological and grade continuity or to allow technical and economic parameters to be applied.
	Inferred resources are too speculative geologically to have economic considerations applied to
	enable them to be categorized as mineral reserves and there is no certainty that mineral resources
	will be upgraded to mineral reserves through continued exploration.
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	Although the Company has carefully prepared and verified the mineral reserve figures presented in
	this Annual Information Form, such figures are estimates, which are, in part, based on
	forward-looking information, and no assurance can be given that the indicated levels of uranium and
	gold will be produced. See &#147;Note Regarding Forward-Looking Information&#148;, &#147;Common Risk Factors &#150;
	Uranium and Gold&#148; &#147;The Nuclear Business &#150; Risk Factors&#148; and &#147;Certain Risk Factors Related to

<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	Cameco Corporation (&#147;Cameco&#148; or the &#147;Company&#148;) was incorporated under the
<I>
	Canada Business
	Corporations Act
</I>
	(&#147;CBCA&#148;) on June&nbsp;19, 1987 to combine the uranium mining and milling operations of
	Saskatchewan Mining Development Corporation (&#147;SMDC&#148;) with the uranium mining, refining and
	conversion operations of Eldorado Nuclear Limited (&#147;ENL&#148;), since renamed Canada Eldor Inc. (&#147;CEI&#148;)
	(the &#147;Reorganization&#148;). The Reorganization of SMDC and ENL was accomplished by the
<I>
	Eldorado
	Nuclear Limited Reorganization and Divestiture Act
</I>
	(Canada) (the &#147;ENL Reorganization Act&#148;) and
<I>
	The
	Saskatchewan Mining Development Corporation Reorganization Act
</I>
	(Saskatchewan). Pursuant to this
	legislation, in October&nbsp;1988 CEI and SMDC transferred substantially all of their assets to Cameco
	in exchange for Cameco assuming substantially all of their current and certain other liabilities
	and issuing common shares, one Class&nbsp;B Share and promissory notes of the Company.
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	On June&nbsp;18, 2001, legislation to amend the ENL Reorganization Act was passed by the federal
	government. The legislative amendment allowed Cameco to proceed with an amendment to Cameco&#146;s
	articles to increase the individual non-resident maximum share ownership from 5% to 15% and to
	increase the limit on aggregate non-resident ownership voting rights from 20% to 25%. This
	amendment was approved by special resolution of Cameco&#146;s shareholders at the 2002 annual
	shareholders meeting.
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	At the 2003 annual and special shareholders meeting, shareholders approved two amendments to
	Cameco&#146;s articles. The first was to permit the board to appoint one or more directors between
	meetings of shareholders as permitted by the CBCA, subject to certain limitations. The second was
	to remove the requirement that the chairman of the board must be ordinarily resident in the
	province of Saskatchewan.
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	At its formation, Cameco&#146;s share capital was owned 61.5% and 38.5%, respectively, by the province
	of Saskatchewan and the Government of Canada. The Company became a publicly traded company in
	Canada after the initial public offering of its common shares in 1991. The province of

	GENERAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE BUSINESS
</B>
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	Cameco is the world&#146;s largest uranium producer. The Company&#146;s competitive position is based
	upon its large, high-grade reserves and low-cost operations, significant market position and access
	to other supplies of uranium. Cameco is also one of the four commercial converters of uranium
	concentrates (&#147;U
<SUB>
	3
</SUB>
	O
<SUB>
	8
</SUB>
	&#148;) to uranium hexafluoride (&#147;UF
<SUB>
	6
</SUB>
	&#148;) in the
	western world and the only commercial supplier of services to convert uranium concentrates to
	uranium dioxide (&#147;UO
<SUB>
	2
</SUB>
	&#148;) in the western world. Cameco, through subsidiaries, has a 31.6%
	limited partnership interest in Bruce Power, which operates North America&#146;s largest nuclear
	electricity generating facility. Bruce Power has six nuclear reactors at the facility in service.
	The Company continues to explore for uranium in a number of countries.
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	While Cameco continues its principal focus on the nuclear business, it also owns 52.7% of Centerra,
	the largest western-based gold producer in Central Asia and the former Soviet Union, which is
	publicly traded on the Toronto Stock Exchange. Centerra operates two producing gold mines, the
	Kumtor mine in the Kyrgyz Republic, in which it has a 100% interest, and the Boroo mine in
	Mongolia, in which it has a 95% interest.

	Overview
</B>
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	The only significant commercial use for uranium is to fuel nuclear power plants for the generation
	of electricity. In recent years, nuclear plants generated approximately 16% of the world&#146;s
	electricity. According to the World Nuclear Association, nuclear plant electric generating
	capacity is expected to grow modestly between now and the year 2014, primarily as a result of new
	reactor construction outside the US and improved reactor operation. The rate of growth is expected
	to be somewhat below that of the total market for electricity.
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	The major stages in the production of nuclear fuel are uranium exploration, mining and milling,
	refining and conversion, enrichment and fuel fabrication. Once a commercial uranium deposit is
	discovered and reserves delineated, regulatory approval to mine is sought. Following regulatory
	approval, the mine is developed, uranium ore is extracted and upgraded at a mill to produce uranium
	concentrates. Mining companies usually sell uranium concentrates to electrical generating
	companies (&#147;utilities&#148;) around the world on the basis of the U
<SUB>
	3
</SUB>
	O
<SUB>
	8
</SUB>
	contained
	in the uranium concentrates. Utilities then contract with converters, enrichers and fuel
	fabricators to produce the required reactor fuel.
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	Cameco&#146;s involvement in the nuclear business consists principally of: (a)&nbsp;exploring for,
	developing, mining and milling uranium ore to produce uranium concentrates; (b)&nbsp;supplying uranium
	refining and conversion services to produce UO
<SUB>
	2
</SUB>
	and UF
<SUB>
	6
</SUB>
	; (c)&nbsp;purchasing
	uranium from third parties; (d)&nbsp;selling produced and acquired uranium to utilities; and (e)&nbsp;its
	subsidiaries collectively being a 31.6% limited partner in Bruce Power, which operates North
	America&#146;s largest nuclear electricity generating facility.

	Each year since 1985, western world uranium production has been less than western world utility

	Excess inventories held by utilities, producers, other fuel cycle participants and governments
	(including Russian government inventories) have been and continue to be a significant source of
	supply. Utilities in Europe also use reprocessed uranium and plutonium derived from used reactor
	fuel as a source of supply. In addition, in recent years, another source of supply has been
	re-enriched depleted uranium tails generated using excess enrichment capacity. Cameco estimates
	these two recycling sources will meet about 8% of western world demand to 2014. Finally, uranium
	derived from the dismantling of Russian nuclear weapons has become a significant source of supply
	and could meet about 11% of western world demand to 2013. A limited amount of uranium from the US
	nuclear weapons program has been introduced into the market, but this is not expected to become a
	significant supply source.

<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	On March&nbsp;24, 1999, the Western Companies signed an agreement with Tenex (such agreement, as
	subsequently amended, the &#147;HEU Commercial Agreement&#148;). Under the HEU Commercial Agreement, the
	Western Companies were granted options to purchase a majority of the Disarmament Uranium.
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	On November&nbsp;16, 2001, Tenex and the Western Companies signed an amendment to the HEU Commercial
	Agreement. Under the terms of the amendment, the Western Companies committed to exercise their
	options to purchase a quantity of uranium (about 124&nbsp;million pounds U
<SUB>
	3
</SUB>
	O
<SUB>

</SUB>
	)
	equal to their share of the annual quota under the USEC Privatization Act for the period 2002 to
	2013. A Cameco subsidiary&#146;s share is 53&nbsp;million pounds. Tenex retained about 82&nbsp;million pounds to
	sell under its share of the US quota. The Western Companies have exclusive options to purchase the
	balance of the Disarmament Uranium. From 2001 to 2003, a Cameco subsidiary exercised options for an
	additional 18&nbsp;million pounds.
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	A series of related agreements between the US and Russian governments (collectively, the &#147;Bilateral
	Agreement&#148;), which are integral to the HEU Commercial Agreement, require Tenex to return to Russia
	the Disarmament Uranium not purchased by the parties to the HEU Commercial Agreement or sold by

<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	Tenex had been selling its share of the US quota through a contract with Globe Nuclear Services and
	Supply GNSS, Limited (&#147;GNSS&#148;). In November&nbsp;2003, Tenex terminated its contract with GNSS effective
	January&nbsp;2004, stating that &#147;the terms of the contract with GNSS are contrary to the interests of
	the Russian Federation.&#148; Tenex has indicated an intention to meet all of the GNSS delivery

<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	On June&nbsp;16, 2004, Tenex and the Western Companies signed a further amendment to the HEU Commercial
	Agreement. The amendment provides, among other things, that the Western Companies will forego a
	portion of their future options on non-quota HEU-derived uranium (i.e. quantities for consumption
	outside the US) to ensure there is sufficient material in Russia for blending down HEU to
	commercially usable low enriched uranium. This amendment was due to Russia&#146;s rising requirements
	for uranium to fuel their expanding nuclear plant construction program within Russia and abroad.
	The amendment to the HEU Commercial Agreement was approved by the US and Russian governments.
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	This amendment resulted in the Western Companies exercising most of their options under the HEU

<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	Due to this further amendment and the Tenex termination of its agreement with GNSS, the amount of
	HEU-derived uranium that theoretically would have been available to the market in the western world

	contained conversion component of some 28&nbsp;million kilograms of uranium as UF

	not subject to the limits set forth in the agreement. Cameco expects the DOC will undertake a
	sunset review of the suspension agreement in the second half of 2005. The review will involve the
	DOC examining whether there is a likelihood of dumping absent the suspension agreement and having
	the US International Trade Commission examine whether termination of the agreement would lead to

<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	The Euratom Supply Agency in Europe, which must approve all uranium-related contracts entered into

	annual individual utility requirements.
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	The US and EU restrictions have no effect on the sales of Russian uranium to other countries.
	About one-quarter of western world uranium requirements arise from utilities in countries
	unaffected by the US and EU restrictions. In 2004, approximately 26% of Cameco&#146;s sales volume was
	to countries not subject to US or EU restrictions. Utilities in some of these countries adopt
	policies which effectively limit the amount of Russian uranium they will purchase. Such policies
	often relate to security of supply concerns or their country&#146;s bilateral relations with Russia.

	Prices
</I>
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	Utilities secure a substantial percentage of their uranium requirements by entering into medium and
	long-term contracts with uranium producers. These contracts usually provide for deliveries to
	begin one to three years after signing and continue for several years thereafter. In awarding
	medium and long-term contracts, Cameco believes utilities consider the commercial terms offered,
	including price, as well as the producer&#146;s record of performance and uranium reserves.
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	Prices are established by a number of methods including base prices adjusted by inflation indices,
	reference prices (generally spot price indicators but also long term reference prices) and annual
	price negotiations. Many contracts also contain floor prices, ceiling prices and other negotiated
	provisions that affect the price ultimately paid. For example, ceiling prices limit the upside
	potential of price movement, while conversely floor prices establish a minimum price that will
	ultimately be paid. Prices under uranium supply contracts are usually confidential.
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	Utilities also acquire uranium through spot and near-term purchases from producers and traders.
	Spot market purchases are those that call for delivery within one year. Traders generally source
	their uranium from organizations holding excess inventory including utilities, producers and

	Cameco generally does not sell into the spot uranium market. Cameco, however, has taken advantage
	of low spot and long-term market prices to purchase uranium under spot and long-term contracts and
	may make additional purchases of these type in the future. At December&nbsp;31, 2004, Cameco had firm

	over the

	Commercial Agreement by a Cameco subsidiary.
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	Over the past several years, Cameco&#146;s strategy was to ensure adequate cash flow in the near term,
	while preserving upside potential with a mix of market-price related and fixed-price contracts.
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	In early 2004, Cameco announced that its sensitivity to quickly rising market prices was limited
	for the near term by ceiling prices in many contracts. These contracts were signed in recent years
	when spot prices, and related ceiling prices, were much lower than price levels at December&nbsp;31,
	2004. For example, 2003 was the first year this decade in which the average spot price rose above
	$10.00 (US)&nbsp;per pound U
<SUB>
	3
</SUB>
	O
<SUB>
	8
</SUB>
	. Accordingly, even though spot market prices have
	continued their rise above $20.00 (US), the benefit to Cameco under these contracts will be limited
	by the ceiling prices until the contracts expire.
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	Long-term price indicators provide guidance as to the level of fixed prices being signed in the
	long-term contract market. From 2001 to 2003, the long-term price indicator averaged less than
	$11.00 (US)&nbsp;per pound, and some of Cameco&#146;s current fixed-price contracts reflect the low long-term
	prices from that period. In 2004, the long-term price averaged more than $20.00 (US)&nbsp;per pound,
	ending the year at $25.00 (US).
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	Given the level of sales targeted each year (32.3&nbsp;million pounds in 2004), Cameco is continually in
	the market signing new contracts for deliveries beginning in two to three years. About 25% to 30%
	of the current contract portfolio expire each year, and is therefore replaced in large part with
	contracts that were entered into in the past two to three years.
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	During this period of rapidly increasing prices, both spot and long-term, the Company has continued
	to enter into new multi-year contracts. The new contract portfolio will reflect a mix of fixed and
	market-related prices. For the time being generally the Company continues to target its traditional
	blend of pricing mechanisms; that is 40% of sales volume with fixed pricing and 60% sensitive to
	market pricing. Contracts with market related pricing will reference the spot or long-term price
	indicators quoted near the time of delivery. These market related contracts typically contain
	ceiling and floor prices. However, in recent months, Cameco has been offering ceiling prices much
	higher than current spot prices, if at all. Cameco has also been negotiating floor price
	protection which has been in the range of current spot prices.
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	As of December&nbsp;31, 2004, the following table indicates the approximate percentage of targeted sales

	Property Description and Environment
</I>
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	This property is located near Toby Lake in northern Saskatchewan, approximately 620 kilometres
	north of Saskatoon. The McArthur River mine site is compact, occupying approximately an area of
	one kilometre in the north/south direction and half a kilometre in the east/west direction. The
	site consists of an underground mine, one full service shaft and two ventilation shafts along with
	numerous surface facilities, including inert waste rock stockpiles, a large capacity mine water
	treatment plant, a pump house, ponds, standby diesel generators as well as maintenance and
	warehousing facilities. Other major facilities include the ore body freezing plant, the
	administration/shop complex, the ore slurry handling and truck load-out facility.
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	The surface facilities and mine shafts for the McArthur River operation are located on lands owned
	by the province of Saskatchewan. Cameco acquired the right to use and occupy the lands under a
	surface lease agreement with the province of Saskatchewan. The most recent surface lease agreement
	was signed in April&nbsp;1999 and is valid for 33&nbsp;years. Obligations attached to the surface lease
	relate primarily to annual reporting regarding the status of the environment, land development and
	progress on northern employment and business development. The lease is renewable if necessary until
	full property decommissioning has been achieved. The McArthur River surface lease presently covers
	about 651 hectares.
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	The mineral property consists of 21 mineral claims and one mineral lease totalling 84,818 hectares.
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	The McArthur River uranium deposit is located in the area subject to mineral lease ML5516. Under
	this mineral lease Cameco acquired the right to mine this deposit. The current mineral lease
	expires in March&nbsp;2014 with the right to renew for successive 10&nbsp;year terms absent a default by
	Cameco.
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	Surrounding the McArthur River uranium deposit are 21 mineral claims. Title to the 21 mineral
	claims is secured until 2017. A mineral claim grants the holder the right to explore for minerals
	within the claim lands and the right to apply for a mineral lease.
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	All resources and reserves on the property are part of the McArthur River deposit.

<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	The means of access to the property is by an all-weather road and by air. Supplies are transported
	by truck and can easily be shipped from anywhere in North America through Cameco&#146;s transit
	warehouse in Saskatoon. McArthur River ore is transported to the Key Lake mill for processing some
	80 kilometres to the southwest along a gravel highway. Site operations are carried out all year
	despite cold winter conditions. The fresh air necessary to ventilate the underground workings is
	heated during the winter months using propane-fired burners. There is easy access to and
	sufficient water from nearby Toby Lake to satisfy all industrial and residential water
	requirements. To minimize fresh water use, most industrial water demands are met by recycling
	water. The site is connected to the provincial power grid. There are standby generators in case
	of grid power interruption. Personnel are recruited from the northern area communities and major
	Saskatchewan population centers such as Saskatoon. Underground development work is tendered to a
	mining contractor. Cameco personnel conduct all production functions.
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	McArthur River is a developed producing property, with surface right holdings that cover all of its
	mining operation needs as well as requirements for residences, access to water, airport, site roads
	and other necessary buildings and infrastructures. No tailings management facilities are required
	as McArthur River ore is milled at the Key Lake mill.
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	The topography and the environment are typical of the taiga that is common to the Athabasca basin

	Cameco, through its predecessor company SMDC, became operator of the McArthur River project in
	1980.
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	Surface exploration programs were active from 1980 through to 1992. Significant mineralizations of
	potentially economic uranium grades were first discovered as a result of surface drilling in the
	1988 and 1989 exploration seasons. Surface drilling programs delineated a mineralized zone over
	1,700 metres in length, occurring at depths ranging between 530 to 640 metres below surface.
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	In 1992, an underground exploration program was proposed to gain more accurate information
	regarding the discovery in order to complete an assessment of the means and feasibility of ore
	extraction. Upon review by the joint Federal/Provincial Panel, and upon receiving the Panel&#146;s
	positive recommendation, exploration camp construction began in February&nbsp;1993 and underground
	exploration proceeded with shaft sinking, level development and definition underground drilling
	until 1997.

	Mine Development
</I>
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	Construction and development of the McArthur River mine was completed on schedule and mining
	commenced in December&nbsp;1999. During the mine start-up, also known as mine commissioning, the
	operation of processing and mining equipment was evaluated and modified as required. Upon
	completion of mine commissioning, commercial production was achieved on November&nbsp;1, 2000.
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	At present, the site includes three shafts. The first shaft is used to move workers, material and
	waste rock. The second shaft is used for mine exhaust air ventilation and as an emergency exit.
	The third shaft was completed in November&nbsp;2000 and is equipped as a third means of egress. This
	third shaft is also used for fresh air ventilation.

	Geology and Mineralization

<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	The McArthur River deposit is located in the south-eastern portion of the Athabasca Basin, within
	the south-west part of the Churchill structural province of the Canadian Shield. The crystalline
	basement rocks underlying the deposit are members of the Aphebian aged Wollaston Domain,
	metasedimentary sequence. These rocks are overlain by flat lying, unmetamorphosed sandstones and
	conglomerates of the Helikian Athabasca Group. These sediments are over 500 metres thick in the
	deposit area.
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	The mineralization is situated alongside a northeast trending graphitic fault, close to the
	unconformity between the basement rock and the overlying Athabasca sandstone.

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<I>
	Exploration, Drilling and Estimates
</I>
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	The original McArthur River resource estimates were derived from surface diamond drilling. The
	drill hole data consists of assay results from 42 drill holes compiled with all relevant geological
	and technical data. The very high grade encountered in these drill holes justified the development
	of an underground exploration project.
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	From 1994 to present, several drilling campaigns from underground levels at 530 metres and 640
	metres depth were completed. Diamond drilling was followed by systematic radiometric probing of the
	holes using a high flux probe adapted to the very high radioactivity encountered. Drill holes
	intersected mineralized zones on a grid spacing of 10 x 10 metres or less. Radiometric probing was
	at 0.10 metre spacing in the radioactive zones. Where core recovery allows it, sampling and
	assaying of the cores as well as density measurements are performed to confirm correlations.
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	The data from more than 750 underground exploration holes drilled have been interpreted and
	estimates of reserves have been made in four mineralized zones. In addition to this drilling, more
	than 330 freeze holes and raisebore pilot holes have provided data supporting the interpretation.
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	Underground drilling programs have further delineated approximately 600 metres of the 1,700-metre
	mineralized zone delineated by surface drilling.
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	Cameco has developed and implemented procedures for quality control, data verification and security
	of sampling that it believes will assure the integrity of information resulting from drilling
	activities at McArthur River.

	Mine Operations
</I>
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	Two permits must be maintained to operate the mine. Cameco holds a &#147;Uranium Mine Facility
	Operating Licence&#148; from the Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission (&#147;CNSC&#148;) and an &#147;Approval to Operate
	Pollutant Control Facilities&#148; from Saskatchewan Environment (&#147;SE&#148;). Both permits are current. The

<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	The sandstones that overlay the basement rocks contain significant water, which is at hydrostatic
	pressure. Water flow into the mine area is prevented primarily by ground freezing. Ore extraction
	is performed by the raise boring method, with broken ore falling to the extraction level. A
	line-of-sight remote controlled loader transports the ore to a grinding circuit. This circuit
	grinds the ore to a size that is acceptable for the Key Lake leaching circuit. From the

	drawn out of the surface ore slurry holding tanks and pumped into containers on a transport truck
	for shipment to the Key Lake mill over an 80 kilometre all-weather road. Once a raise has been
	bored through the ore zone, it is backfilled with concrete. After all the rows of raises are

	. The uranium is then dissolved in a leaching circuit.
	Uranium solution is then separated from the remaining ore solids in a counter current decantation
	circuit. The uranium solution is further concentrated in a solvent extraction circuit. The uranium
	is precipitated out of solution by the addition of ammonia. The ammonium diuranate is thickened

	There are two tailings management facilities at the Key Lake site. One is an above-ground
	impoundment with tailings stored within compacted till embankments. This facility, constructed in
	1983, has not received tailings since 1998. Cameco is reviewing several decommissioning options
	regarding this facility.
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	The other tailings management facility (&#147;TMF&#148;) is the Deilmann pit. The east-end of the Deilmann
	pit was mined out in April&nbsp;1995 and then converted to a TMF that has been in operation since the
	beginning of 1996. The west-end of the Deilmann pit was mined out in 1997 and then converted to a
	TMF. The Deilmann TMF uses a staged subaerial/subaqueous tailings deposition mode with an initial
	pervious sand envelope constructed around the perimeter of the pit. The sand envelope allows
	excess water to drain to a drainage blanket underlying the tailings at the bottom of the pit and
	then to dewatering pumps in a raise well connected by a drift to the drainage blanket. At the end
	of 1998, approval was received from the CNSC and Saskatchewan Environment Resource Management to
	cease construction of the sand envelope and convert the mode of tailings deposition from subaerial
	to subaqueous. This is in accordance with the environmental impact statement prepared and approved
	for the tailings facility. Conversion started immediately. Flooding commenced in June&nbsp;1999. Based
	upon the most recent mine reserve estimate, Cameco estimates the Deilmann TMF has adequate capacity
	to hold the tailings from milling McArthur

	Safety and Radiation Control
</I>
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	At McArthur River, a key source of radiation exposure during mining results from radon gas that
	emanates from ore and groundwater. Radon exposure is minimized by effective use of ventilation.
	Water inflows are collected underground and pumped to the surface for treatment before being
	released to the environment. Exposure to radiation from the high-grade ore is minimized by
	containment, shielding and remote handling.
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	The radiation levels that workers at McArthur River and Key Lake receive are closely monitored.
	This includes the use of both personal and area monitoring to measure and control exposures.
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	Under the CNSC&#146;s Nuclear Safety and Control Act, radiation exposure limits incorporate a formula
	that combine the doses of gamma radiation, radon and dust intake which an individual receives in a

	Although Cameco believes that McArthur River reserve and resource estimates will not be materially
	affected by external factors, such as metallurgical, safety and environmental, permitting, legal,
	title, taxation and political issues, there can be no assurance that they will not be. There are
	numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating mineral reserves and resources. The accuracy of any
	reserve and resource estimation is the function of the quality of available data and of engineering
	and geological interpretation and judgment. Results from drillings, testing and production, as well
	as a material change in the uranium price, subsequent to the date of the estimate, may justify
	revision of such estimates.
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	In January&nbsp;2003 Cameco initiated a formal review of the mining plan and proposed mining methods and
	a review of the reserves classification at McArthur River as a result of uncertainty associated
	with the productivity of the jetboring and boxhole boring mining methods at McArthur River and not
	as a result of the water inflow event. The jetboring and boxhole boring mining methods may be
	utilized for parts of the ore body where the raise boring method may be inappropriate. The
	completion of the review reflecting this uncertainty resulted in the reclassification as of
	December&nbsp;31, 2003 of 51.8&nbsp;million lbs U

<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	At the end of 2004, Cameco reclassified about 73.7&nbsp;million pounds of indicated resources to
	inferred resources. Based upon Cameco&#146;s experience in underground mining at McArthur River, Cameco
	has less confidence in the estimate for it to be used to support mine planning and economic
	evaluation of this part of the ore body, as is necessary for it to remain as an indicated resource.
	This estimate is based upon widely spaced historical surface drilling only. Further delineation of
	this part of the ore body by underground drilling is necessary to provide more confidence in the
	estimate. Cameco is embarked on an underground drilling program in an attempt to provide sufficient
	information for part of this resource to be upgraded to a reserve.

	The Cigar Lake minesite is located near Waterbury Lake, approximately 660 kilometres north of
	Saskatoon. The Cigar Lake minesite was developed for the activities of test mining. At present,
	the site consists of an underground development, complete with two main levels and a 500-metre mine
	shaft and head frame, water treatment ponds, standby generators, freeze plant, office, shop,
	warehouse, construction residences and support installations.
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	The surface facilities and mine shaft for the Cigar Lake project are located on lands owned by the
	province of Saskatchewan. Cameco acquired the right to use and occupy the lands under a surface
	lease agreement with the province of Saskatchewan. The most recent surface lease was signed in May
	2004 and is valid for 33&nbsp;years. Obligations attached to the surface lease agreement primarily
	relate to annual reporting regarding the status of the environment, the land development and
	progress made on northern employment and business development. The lease is renewable if necessary
	until full property decommissioning has been achieved. The Cigar Lake surface lease covers a total
	of 974 hectares.
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	The mineral property consists of one mineral lease, totalling 308 hectares, and 25 mineral claims,
	totalling 92,740 hectares. The mineral lease and mineral claims are contiguous. The Cigar Lake
	deposit is located in the area subject to mineral lease ML5521. The right to mine this uranium
	deposit was acquired under this mineral lease, as renewed, effective December&nbsp;1, 2001. The
	mineral lease is for a term of 10&nbsp;years with the right to renew for successive 10&nbsp;year terms absent

<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	The first uranium mineralization discovery at Cigar Lake was in May&nbsp;1981. Since that time, the
	deposit has been defined by approximately 200 holes and 92,000 metres of core drilling from
	surface. Cigar Lake Mining Corporation (&#147;CLMC&#148;) was the operator of the project from 1985 to 2001.
	Effective January&nbsp;1, 2002, Cameco replaced CLMC as operator.
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	In 1993, a preliminary feasibility study was delivered to the joint venture partners. An
	environmental impact statement was filed with the relevant regulatory agencies in 1995. Technical
	challenges involving groundwater, rock properties and radiation protection were evaluated during
	the test mining phase.
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	Public hearings on the project environmental impact statement were concluded in 1997 and the joint
	federal-provincial panel recommended to the governments of Canada and Saskatchewan that the project
	be allowed to proceed, subject to resolution, on terms acceptable to regulatory authorities, of
	issues with respect to a tailings management facility and waste rock disposal. In April&nbsp;1998, both
	levels of government accepted the joint panel recommendations and authorized the project to proceed
	to the regulatory licensing stage.
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	In June&nbsp;2001, the joint venture partners approved a feasibility study and detailed engineering
	design was initiated. The initial estimate of the project development costs was $350&nbsp;million on a

	In early 2003, the CNSC informed Cameco that a new screening level environmental assessment would
	need to be completed prior to the issuance of construction and operating licences. On June&nbsp;30,
	2004, the CNSC approved the environmental assessment, allowing the project to move to the CNSC
	construction licensing stage. In July&nbsp;2004, the CNSC issued a licence to Cameco for construction of
	specific surface facilities. On December&nbsp;20, 2004, the CNSC approved the full construction
	licence for the Cigar Lake project.
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	Although Cameco has received a full construction licence from the CNSC, additional permits will be

	The Cigar Lake deposit is located approximately 40 kilometres inside the margin of the eastern part
	of the Athabasca Basin. It occurs at the unconformity contact between rock of the Athabasca Group
	and underlying lower Proterozoic Wollaston Group metasedimentary rocks, an analogous setting to the
	Key Lake, the McClean Lake and Collins Bay deposits. It shares many similarities with these
	deposits, including general structural setting, mineralogy, geochemistry, host rock association and
	the age of the mineralization. The Cigar Lake deposit is distinguished from other similar deposits
	by its size, its very high grade, and the high degree of associated hydrothermal clay alteration.
	The deposit is flat lying, approximately 1950 metres long, 20 to 100 metres wide, and ranges up to
	16 metres thick. It occurs at depths ranging between 410 to 450 metres below the surface.

<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	The exploration of the Cigar Lake deposit was performed by Cogema. A data bank was created from
	all assay measurement of the various elements. Algorithms were established for the density
	determination based on the nature of the mineralization and of the surrounding ground.
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	Cogema produced for CLMC various reserve and resource estimates. These estimates were reviewed in
	2000 by a task force from Cogema, CLMC and Cameco. At that time, new test reserve and resource
	estimates were completed both by Cogema and Cameco and the results were compared.
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	A new definition of the reserves based on the latest technical tests and economics has been
	implemented. The new definition is based on a minimum uranium content and a minimum grade for each
	estimated block.
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">

	Test Mining
</I>
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	A test mining program was approved in late 1987. Shaft sinking began in 1988, reaching a final
	depth of 501 metres in early 1990. Horizontal development was advanced on two levels and test
	mining in frozen ground, using box hole boring and high pressure water jet boring, was successfully
	carried out in 1991 and 1992.
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	During 1998, CLMC successfully tested a mechanical mine development system suitable to local
	underground conditions and at year-end commissioned a freeze hole drilling system. Also,
	throughout 1998, CLMC produced a number of engineering studies that examined project development
	and milling options.
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	In 1999 and 2000, further jet boring tests were completed with improved systems. Information
	acquired from these tests was used to update the feasibility study, which was later approved by the
	joint venture partners in June&nbsp;2001.
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	Subject to regulatory approval, the jet boring mining method will be used to mine the ore body. It
	will consist of four metre diameter holes bored with a high pressure water jet in the previously
	frozen high grade orebody. The ore will be ground and slurried underground, pumped to surface and
	loaded into specialized containers. All the ore slurry will be shipped to Cogema&#146;s McClean Lake
	mill for initial processing. Approximately one-half of the resulting uranium bearing solution will
	then be processed at the McClean Lake mill with the other half being transported to the Rabbit Lake
	mill for further processing. See

<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	In April&nbsp;2004, Joint Venture Inkai decided to proceed with construction of an ISL mine at Inkai,
	with a planned annual capacity of 2.6&nbsp;million pounds, after they approved a feasibility study which
	estimated the capital cost to do so at $38&nbsp;million (US). Subsequently, the joint venture approved
	the expansion of the proposed mine to have a 5.2&nbsp;million pound annual capacity at an estimated

	commercial production in late 2007 and ramp up to full production in 2009.
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	In the first half of 2005, Joint Venture Inkai intends to submit an environmental assessment and

	governing the environmental approval and permitting process for new mining projects in Kazakhstan.
	Based upon Cameco&#146;s experience to date, Cameco believes that all permits and approvals required for
	construction and operation of the new ISL mine will be obtained in a timely fashion and in the
	ordinary course of business.
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	Cameco has agreed to fund up to $40&nbsp;million (US)&nbsp;for project development, which includes funding of
	the test mine, with an interest bearing loan. To December&nbsp;31, 2004, Cameco, through subsidiaries,
	had advanced $28&nbsp;million (US). Joint Venture Inkai will fund the remainder. Repayment of the
	principal amount of the loan is expected once commercial production commences. Joint Venture Inkai
	is obligated to repay the loan and interest.
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	The Inkai ISL project is subject to decommissioning liabilities. Subsequent to commencement of

	The majority of Cameco&#146;s exploration lands are explored as joint ventures with other mining
	companies, with Cogema the most common joint venture partner. At year-end 2004, Cameco operated
	approximately 80% of its exploration projects, including joint ventures. The majority of Cameco&#146;s
	exploration projects are early to middle stage, on which indications of economic grades or
	quantities of uranium have not yet been identified.
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	In 2004, Cameco also carried out surface exploration near existing mines, specifically the Rabbit
	Lake and McArthur River operations, with the intent to locate new resources that could be developed
	to expand or extend these operations. This exploration was successful at both locations. At Rabbit
	Lake, a new zone, the O2Next zone, was discovered north of the Eagle Point mine. Work on another
	advanced exploration project, the Cree Extension project, has advanced the Millennium discovery,
	initially made in 2000, to an indicated and inferred resource.
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	Cameco periodically acquires new exploration land holdings in both Canada and Australia, where the
	Company perceives the discovery potential to be worth the cost of acquiring and holding the land.
	At the same time, the Company may decide to reduce its interest in certain projects through
	farm-out agreements or other arrangements.

	At December&nbsp;31, 2004, Cameco owned a 25.2% interest in UEX Corporation, a TSX listed junior
	exploration company formed in 2002 from a combination of exploration assets previously held by
	Cameco and Pioneer Metals Corporation, and has certain rights related to financing, milling, and
	marketing future uranium deposits produced by UEX. Once Cameco&#146;s interest falls below 20%, these
	special rights end.
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	Since many areas of the world are known to host numerous types of uranium mineralization, Cameco
	actively investigates the uranium exploration potential of areas other than those described above.
	No major exploration projects are currently being undertaken in areas outside Canada and Australia.

<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	Canadian Securities Administrators&#146; National Instrument 43-101 requires mining companies to
	disclose reserves and resources using the subcategories of proven reserves, probable reserves,
	measured resources, indicated resources and inferred resources. Cameco reports reserves and
	resources separately. (See &#147;Note Regarding Reserves and Resources.&#148;)
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	Commencing December&nbsp;31, 2004, Cameco reports all its mineral reserves as a quantity of contained
	ore supporting the mining plans. Generally, this approach has always been used to estimate and
	report the uranium reserves for Cameco&#146;s Canadian properties. In contrast, the reserve estimates
	for Cameco&#146;s US and Inkai ISL properties were reported as the recoverable uranium after giving
	effect to the expected leaching and processing loss. As part of this standardized approach to
	reserve reporting, Cameco is now disclosing in its reserves table its estimate of the metallurgical
	recovery for each of its properties. Metallurgical recovery is a term used in the mining industry
	to indicate the proportion of valuable material physically recovered by the metallurgical
	extraction process. The estimated recoverable amount of a commodity is obtained by multiplying the
	reserves &#147;Content&#148; by the &#147;Estimated Metallurgical Recovery Percentage&#148;.

	For the purpose of estimating reserves in accordance with National Instrument 43-101, a uranium price of $21.80 (US)&nbsp;was used. For the purpose of estimating reserves in accordance with US Securities Commission Industry Guide 7 for US reporting purposes, a uranium price of $13.40 (US)&nbsp;was used. Estimated uranium reserves

	This section uses the term &#147;inferred resources&#148;. United States investors are advised that while
	this term is recognized and required by Canadian securities regulatory authorities, the United
	States Securities and Exchange Commission does not recognize it. &#147;Inferred resources&#148; have a great
	amount of uncertainty as to their existence and great amount of uncertainty as to their economic
	and legal feasibility. It cannot be assumed that all or any part of an inferred resource will ever
	be upgraded to a higher category. Under Canadian securities regulations, estimates of inferred
	resources may not form the basis of feasibility or prefeasibility studies. Investors are cautioned
	not to assume that part or all of an inferred resource exists or is economically or legally
	mineable.

	Uranium Reserves Reconciliation
</I>
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	The following reconciliation of Cameco&#146;s share of uranium reserves reflects the changes in reserves
	during 2004. The 2004 additions and deletions result from additional information provided by
	mining and milling, analysis of drilling results, and reclassification.
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	A re-assessment of the mining and economic parameters used to estimate reserves at some ISL
	properties in Wyoming has resulted in the loss of 13.5&nbsp;million pounds of reserves and the
	reclassification of some proven reserves to the probable category. At Crow Butte, development
	drilling resulted in an increase of 1.8&nbsp;million pounds of reserves. Due to the change in reporting
	format for the ISL properties as disclosed before the uranium reserves table, in place
	reserves contain nearly 29&nbsp;million pounds more than previously reported as recoverable reserves. At
	Rabbit Lake, underground drilling has delineated additional reserves of 7.4&nbsp;million pounds

	The following reconciliation of Cameco&#146;s share of uranium resources reflects the changes in
	resources during 2004. The 2004 additions and deletions result from additional information
	provided by mining and milling, analysis of drilling results, and reclassification.
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	The major change is resources during 2004 is the re-classification of 73.7&nbsp;million pounds
	U
<SUB>
	3
</SUB>
	O
<SUB>
	8
</SUB>
	of indicated resources to inferred resources at McArthur River to
	reflect a lower confidence in the geometry and grade of the mineralization encountered by widely
	spaced historical surface drilling. Successful drilling at the Millennium project has identified
	indicated resources of 14.5&nbsp;million pounds U

	and inferred resources of 6.6
	million pounds U

	3
</SUB>
	O
<SUB>

</SUB>
	. The re-assessment of the mining and economic parameters
	used to define reserves at some ISL properties in Wyoming has resulted in the loss of 3.4&nbsp;million
	pounds of resources. Drilling at Crow Butte has successfully converted 1.1&nbsp;million pounds of
	inferred resources into the reserves category.

<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	Similar to their procurement of uranium requirements, utilities secure a substantial percentage of

	conversion service providers. Prices are established by a number of methods, including base prices
	adjusted by inflation indices, reference prices (generally spot price indicators) and annual price
	negotiations. Contracts can also contain floor prices, ceiling prices and other negotiated
	provisions which affect the price ultimately paid. Base price contracts with adjustment for

	Once the Company&#146;s reserves of a particular deposit in Canada have been exhausted or after

	environmental and radiological performance. These estimates are regularly reviewed by the Company
	for accounting purposes, as well as for license renewal applications as required by regulatory
	agencies. The regulatory agencies accept the decommissioning plans in concept, not based upon
	detailed performance forecasts, which have not been generated. As Cameco properties approach or go
	into decommissioning, further regulatory review of the decommissioning plans may result in
	additional decommissioning requirements, associated costs and the requirement to provide additional
	financial assurances. As of December&nbsp;31, 2004, Cameco had accrued a total accounting provision of
	approximately $144&nbsp;million related to nuclear activities. See Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial

	On October&nbsp;6, 2000, the government of Canada and certain Port Hope area communities announced the
	signing of a &#147;Principles of Understanding&#148;, establishing the framework for development of a legal
	agreement for the clean up, storage and long-term management of certain of the Historical Wastes.
	On June&nbsp;19, 2001, the government of Canada announced that the legal agreement had been signed and
	that it would invest about $260&nbsp;million over 10&nbsp;years to carry out the work. In July&nbsp;2002, the
	government of Canada released the scope document for the environmental assessment of the project to
	manage low level radioactive waste for the long term in the Port Hope area. The project remains in
	the environmental assessment process.
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	Pursuant to the Principles of Understanding, in March&nbsp;2004, Cameco reached an agreement to transfer
	the Port Granby Waste and Welcome Waste Sites to the government of Canada, which through its
	ownership of ENL indirectly owned these waste sites prior to 1988. The transfer will occur after
	the government receives a license to construct a long-term waste management facility at these
	sites. As part of the transaction, the government has agreed to accept, without charge, 150,000
	cubic metres of Cameco owned low-level radioactive waste.
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	The government has also agreed to assume all liability for wastes located at these sites after
	taking ownership, subject to Cameco&#146;s obligation to complete its maximum contribution of $25
	million towards management and decommissioning of Historical Wastes. Cameco had previously
	recognized this liability for its maximum contribution of $25&nbsp;million toward the cost of managing
	this material and actually has spent about $ 3.6&nbsp;million of this ongoing commitment.

	Regulatory Compliance
</I>
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	Potentially significant regulatory issues relate to the establishment of new criteria for levels of
	uranium in ambient air in the vicinity of the Company&#146;s Ontario operations and new criteria for
	heavy metals in effluent from Cameco&#146;s Saskatchewan mine and mill sites, establishment of new
	enhanced environmental monitoring programs in the vicinity of all Canadian operations and decisions
	arising from the current evaluation of radionuclide releases (including uranium) from nuclear
	facilities being carried out under the Canadian Environmental Protection Act. Changes to these
	regulations may require additional response by Cameco in the near term in order to remain in
	compliance with the relevant regulations and regulatory guidelines.
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	These new regulatory initiatives and future initiatives have and likely will continue to generate
	additional environmental studies in the vicinity of these operations. This is particularly evident
	in the area of pre-licensing environmental assessment. It is unclear if these additional studies
	will ultimately translate into further regulatory requirements on the Company.
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	Cameco continues to face challenges from the burden of increasing regulatory demands and costs from
	the CNSC, Canadian Environmental Assessment Agency and other federal and provincial regulators. In
	addition to the issues noted above, the lead regulator, the CNSC, has increased its fees charged to
	the nuclear industry. The CNSC is increasing the regulatory burden as a result of the
	implementation of the Nuclear Safety and Control Act (&#147;NSCA&#148;) and in its interpretation of
	responsibilities under the NSCA, the Canadian Environmental Assessment Act and the Canadian
	Environmental Protection Act. For instance, Cameco has been directed to implement a formal quality
	assurance program to manage its Canadian nuclear operations and the scope of assessment needed for
	regulatory approval of changes to licence conditions has expanded. Lower tier operational changes
	are increasingly subject to regulatory review which may include delays due to longer regulatory
	approval processes. These increasing requirements are expected to result in gradually increasing
	administration costs and some additional capital expenditures for compliance. As well, the complex
	regulatory approval process reduces Cameco&#146;s flexibility to make operational changes in a timely
	fashion.
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	In recent years, when auditing Cameco, the CNSC has put a priority on auditing specific
	environmental and safety related programs. These have included such aspects as radiation
	protection programs, environmental monitoring, fire protection, operational quality assurance,
	organization and management evaluation, transportation systems, geotechnical monitoring and
	ventilation systems. These program-specific audits and regular site inspections by regulatory
	project officers have generated, and are intended to continue to generate, actions to improve
	environmental and safety performance and ensure that these risks remain well managed. Resulting
	program modifications are typically procedural and do not incur large capital costs.

<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	Cameco subsidiaries&#146; ISL operations in the US are subject to numerous federal, state and local
	regulations governing, among other things, air emissions, water discharges, hazardous materials
	handling and disposal and site reclamation. In 2000, at the Highland operation, PRI self reported
	to the Wyoming Department of Environmental Quality (&#147;WDEQ&#148;) injection well casing leaks, resulting
	in releases into unauthorized zones. As a result of PRI&#146;s report, the Wyoming agency issued a
	notice of violation (&#147;NOV&#148;). PRI took the position that there was minimal environmental impact,
	given the quality of the released water and the geotechnical characteristics of the release zones.
	Nevertheless, the issue required additional investigation as a potential future decommissioning
	issue, and necessitated procedural and physical modifications in well construction to better assure
	injection well integrity. The well casing leaks are not expected to materially increase site
	decommissioning costs. There was no fine associated with the NOV, largely because of the
	self-reporting of the issue and its low potential for environmental impact. Arising from the NOV
	was an Administrative Order on Consent, which specified a compliance schedule and a revision of the
	regulatory permit to address the casing leak issue. The Order on Consent essentially forms a
	contract for resolving the issues arising out of the NOV. Changes in well construction have
	reduced the frequency of well casing leaks. The changes have been implemented at PRI&#146;s combined
	Smith Ranch-Highland operation.
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	After mining has been completed, an ISL wellfield must be restored in accordance with regulatory
	requirements. Generally this involves restoring the groundwater to its pre-mining use using reverse
	osmosis (ultra filtration technology) and restoration. Restoration of Crow Butte wellfields is
	regulated by the Nebraska Department of Environmental Quality (&#147;NDEQ&#148;) and the Nuclear Regulatory
	Commission (&#147;NRC&#148;) and restoration of Smith Ranch-Highland wellfields is regulated by the WDEQ and
	NRC.
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	Crow Butte has three wellfields under restoration. In 2000 Crow Butte Resources Inc., after the
	NDEQ confirmed that wellfield 1 was restored to its regulatory standards, requested the NRC accept
	that wellfield 1 was restored to its regulatory standards. The NRC approved the restoration on
	February&nbsp;12, 2003.
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	Smith Ranch-Highland has three wellfields under restoration. In 1999 PRI requested the WDEQ accept
	that the A wellfield was restored to its regulatory standards. The WDEQ approved the restoration of
	the A wellfield, subject to some long term monitoring requirements in November&nbsp;2003. The NRC
	approved the restoration of the A wellfield in June&nbsp;20004.
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	The NRC has indicated that it is willing to enter into discussions with the WDEQ and the United
	States Environmental Protection Agency over wellfield jurisdiction. Discussions continue with
	regulators to establish clear jurisdiction and criteria for wellfield restoration. Despite
	encouraging signs to the contrary, the delays by regulators to accept restoration of the remaining
	wellfields is a significant issue for Cameco subsidiaries&#146; US ISL operations, since it remains
	uncertain when, and at what cost, its US subsidiaries&#146; ISL operations will be able to complete

	Canadian Nuclear Safety and Control Act

<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	In Canada, control of the mining, extraction, use and export of uranium was formerly governed by
	the
<I>
	Atomic Energy Control Act
</I>
	(the &#147;AECA&#148;), a federal statute. The AECA was administered by the
	AECB. On March&nbsp;20, 1997, the NSCA received royal assent. In the following years, related
	regulations and key regulatory guidelines were prepared and finalized. On May&nbsp;31, 2000, the new
	act and regulations came into force replacing the AECA. The NSCA expands the jurisdiction of the
	CNSC, which has replaced the AECB, notably expanding its role in environmental regulation.
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	The NSCA authorizes the CNSC to make regulations governing all aspects of the development and
	application of nuclear energy, including uranium mining, milling, conversion and transportation.
	The most significant powers given to the CNSC are in the licensing area. The NSCA grants the CNSC
	licensing authority for all nuclear activities in Canada, including the issuance of new licences to
	new operators, the renewal of existing licences, and amendments to existing licences. A person may
	only possess or dispose of nuclear substances and construct, operate and decommission its nuclear
	facilities in accordance with the terms of a CNSC licence. The licence specifies conditions that
	licensees must satisfy in order to maintain the right to operate nuclear facilities.
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	A fundamental principle in nuclear regulation is that the licensee bears the responsibility for
	safety, with the CNSC setting safety objectives and auditing licensee&#146;s performance against the
	objectives. The regulations made under NSCA include provisions dealing with facilities licence
	requirements, radiation protection, physical security for all nuclear facilities and the transport
	of radioactive materials. The CNSC has also issued guidance documents to assist licensees in
	complying with regulatory requirements such as decommissioning, emergency planning, and
	optimization of radiation protection measures.
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	The NSCA is the product of a recent update of regulatory requirements by the Federal government in
	relation to the effective regulation of nuclear energy in Canada. The NSCA grants to the CNSC the
	power to act as a court of record, the right to require financial guarantees for nuclear waste
	management and decommissioning as a condition of granting a licence, order-making powers which are
	more flexible than those allowed under the predecessor legislation, the AECA, and the right to
	impose higher monetary penalties than was allowed under such predecessor legislation. The NSCA also
	grants the CNSC power to require nuclear power plant operator re-certification and to set
	requirements for nuclear facility security measures. The NSCA also provides for increased emphasis
	on environmental matters, including a requirement that licensing applicants make adequate provision
	for the protection of the environment. Additional regulatory priority is evident in the areas of
	quality assurance and human factor engineering and assessment.

	The uranium recovery industry in Wyoming is also regulated by the WDEQ, Land Quality Division
	(&#147;LQD&#148;) pursuant to the Wyoming Environmental Quality Act (&#147;WEQA&#148;) and the LQD Non-Coal Rules and

	Clean Air Act and the Clean Water Act, some of which are incorporated into the LQD Non-Coal Rules
	and Regulations (for example the Underground Injection Control regulations under the Clean Water
	Act). Currently wellfield decommissioning is required to the background water standard in Wyoming.
	In November&nbsp;2003, the WDEQ approved the wellfield groundwater restoration for Highland wellfield A
	subject to some long-term monitoring conditions. In June&nbsp;2004, the NRC approved wellfield
	groundwater restoration for Highland wellfield A.
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	Similarly, the uranium recovery industry in Nebraska is regulated by the NRC and the NDEQ pursuant

	trade with specific countries (or political blocs such as the EU), with the general goal of

	Most of the Company&#146;s uranium reserves and resources are located in Saskatchewan. The right to
	mine minerals is acquired by the Company as a lessee under a mineral lease from the province of
	Saskatchewan (a &#147;Crown Lease&#148;). A Crown Lease is for a term of 10&nbsp;years, with a right to renew for
	successive 10&nbsp;year terms in the absence of default by the lessee. The lessee is required to expend
	certain amounts for work during each year of a Crown Lease. A Crown Lease cannot be terminated
	except in the event of default and for certain environmental concerns as prescribed in
<I>
	The Crown
	Minerals Act

	(Saskatchewan). However, Crown Leases may be amended unilaterally by the lessor by an

	The right to explore for minerals is acquired by the Company in Saskatchewan under a mineral claim
	from the province of Saskatchewan (a &#147;Mineral Claim&#148;). The term of a Mineral Claim is two years,
	with the right to renew for successive one year periods. To maintain a Mineral Claim in good
	standing, generally, the holder of a Mineral Claim must expend a prescribed amount on exploration.
	Excess expenditures can be applied to satisfy expenditure requirements for future claim years.
	Except for exploration purposes, a Mineral Claim does not grant the holder the right to mine
	minerals. A holder of a Mineral Claim in good standing has the right to convert a Mineral Claim
	into a Mineral Lease. Surface exploration work of a Mineral Claim requires additional governmental
	approvals.
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	The surface facilities and mine shafts are located on lands owned by the province of Saskatchewan.
	The right to use and occupy the lands is acquired under a surface lease (a &#147;Surface Lease&#148;) from
	the province of Saskatchewan. A Surface Lease is for a period of time, up to a maximum of 33
	years, as is necessary to allow the lessee to operate its mine and plant and thereafter to carry
	out the reclamation of the lands involved. Surface Leases are also used by the province of
	Saskatchewan as a mechanism to achieve certain environmental protection, radiation protection and
	socioeconomic objectives and as a result contain certain undertakings in this regard.
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	The Company&#146;s uranium mining and exploration properties in Saskatchewan are located on traditional
	lands of first nations. Pursuant to historical treaties first nation bands ceded title to most
	traditional lands in northern Saskatchewan in exchange for treaty lands but generally retained
	their right to hunt, fish and trap on these traditional lands. Cameco understands that the federal
	and Saskatchewan governments have a duty to consult first nations before they take actions that
	will affect the ability of first nations&#146; people to exercise these rights. In a 2004 decision of
	the Supreme Court of Canada, involving the Haida First Nation and lands not ceded to the government
	of British Columbia pursuant to a treaty, affirmed the existence of a legal duty on the government
	to consult and, in certain circumstances, accommodate asserted aboriginal interests on an interim
	basis pending final resolution by treaty or otherwise. The duty to consult and accommodate does
	not, however, extend to private industry who seek

	the First Nation agree to the proposed accommodation.
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	In February&nbsp;2004, Cameco received correspondence from the English River First Nation asserting a
	right to be consulted with respect to the use of its traditional lands, which encompass the
	McArthur River mine, Key Lake mill and certain exploration areas. In January&nbsp;2005, a similar
	assertion was made by the M&#233;tis Nation of Saskatchewan, but which also threatened non-violent civil
	disobedience, which would have a negative impact on Cameco&#146;s operations. In February&nbsp;2005, the
	M&#233;tis Nation of Saskatchewan stated that, in order to pressure the government of Saskatchewan to
	meet its demands, it would establish road blockades at junctions of certain provincial highways
	near Key Lake. As the threatened road blockades could have resulted in Cameco ceasing milling and
	mining operations at Key Lake and McArthur River, Cameco obtained an injunction from the
	Saskatchewan Court of Queens Bench, prohibiting the M&#233;tis Nation of Saskatchewan from proceeding
	with the road blockade.
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	Although formal demands to be consulted came from the English First River Nation and the M&#233;tis
	Nation of Saskatchewan, the right to be consulted and accommodated with respect to development on
	aboriginal traditional lands is an expectation of all First Nation groups in Northern Saskatchewan.
	While not having a legal duty to consult, Cameco has a practice of engaging in extensive dialogue
	with First Nations and other stakeholders in northern Saskatchewan and believes it has good
	relations with them. Cameco also employs a significant number of First Nations and M&#233;tis at its
	operations and has substantial business relationships with First Nations and M&#233;tis in northern
	Saskatchewan and provides other social and educational support for them in northern Saskatchewan.
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	First Nations in Saskatchewan generally assert that the historical treaties are not an accurate
	record of their agreement with the Canadian government and that they did not cede title to the
	minerals when they ceded title to the land. First Nations have launched a lawsuit in Alberta
	claiming that they did not cede title to oil and natural gas when they ceded title to the land. A
	similar lawsuit could be brought by First Nations in Saskatchewan.

	The Company&#146;s uranium reserves and resources in the US are held by subsidiaries and are located in
	Wyoming and Nebraska. The right to mine or develop minerals is acquired either by leases from the
	fee simple owners (private parties or the state) or mining claims located on property owned by the
	US Federal Government. In addition, the Company&#146;s subsidiaries acquire surface leases which allow
	wellfield installation and operation to permit the mining of the uranium reserves by ISL methods.

	Cameco pays royalties to the province of Saskatchewan on the sale of uranium extracted from ore
	bodies within the province under the terms of Part&nbsp;III of the Crown Mineral Royalty Schedule, 1986
	(Saskatchewan) (the &#147;Schedule&#148;), as amended. Royalties include both a basic royalty and a tiered
	royalty. The basic royalty is equal to 5% of gross sales of uranium and is reduced by the
	Saskatchewan resource credit equal to 1% of the gross sales of uranium.
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	The tiered royalty is an additional levy on the gross sales of uranium which applies only when the
	sales price of uranium exceeds levels prescribed by the Schedule. Uranium sales subject to the
	tiered royalty are first reduced by capital allowances as permitted by the Schedule for new mine or
	mill construction and certain mill expansion. When these capital allowances are reduced to zero,
	tiered royalties become payable. Both the prices and the capital allowances as defined in the
	Schedule are adjusted annually to reflect changes in the Canadian gross domestic product.

	Large underground flood at the McArthur River Mine or Cigar Lake Project
</I>
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	On April&nbsp;6, 2003, production at Cameco&#146;s McArthur River mine was temporarily suspended, as an
	increased water inflow from an area of collapsed rock in a new development area began to flood
	portions of the mine. This incident resulted in a considerable shortfall in 2003 uranium
	production. The sandstone that overlay the basement rocks of the McArthur River deposit contains
	significant water, which is at hydrostatic pressure. Water flow into the mine area is generally
	prevented by ground freezing. There are technical challenges at McArthur River involving the
	groundwater and rock properties.
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	On December&nbsp;21, 2004, the Cigar Lake joint venture decided to proceed with construction of a mine
	at Cigar Lake. The Cigar Lake deposit has hydro-geological characteristics similar to McArthur
	River and as a result also has technical challenges involving ground water and rock properties.
	Water flow into the mine area will also be generally prevented by ground freezing.

<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	There can be no guarantee against another flood of the McArthur River mine or a flood at the Cigar

	ability of Cameco to pursue exploration, development and mining at its Saskatchewan uranium
	producing properties (McArthur River and Rabbit Lake) and developmental property (Cigar Lake), as

	Nation and the M&#233;tis Nation of Saskatchewan to be consulted and accommodated with respect to
	development on aboriginal traditional lands, which is an expectation of all First Nation groups in
	Northern Saskatchewan. Pursuant to historical treaties First Nation bands in Northern Saskatchewan
	ceded titled to most traditional lands in Northern Saskatchewan in exchange for treaty lands.
	However, First Nations in Saskatchewan continue to assert that their treaties are not an accurate
	record of their agreement with the Canadian government and that they did not cede title to the
	minerals when they ceded title to their traditional lands. First Nations have launched a lawsuit
	in Alberta making a similar claim that they did not cede title to the oil and natural gas rights
	when they ceded title to their traditional lands. A similar lawsuit could be brought by First
	Nations in Saskatchewan.
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	Managing these issues is an integral part of exploration, development and mining in Saskatchewan
	and Cameco is committed to managing these issues effectively. However, in view of the legal and

	Competition from Other Energy Sources and Public Acceptance of Nuclear Energy
</I>
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	Nuclear energy competes with other sources of energy, including oil, natural gas, coal and
	hydro-electricity. These other energy sources are to some extent interchangeable with nuclear
	energy, particularly over the longer term. Sustained lower prices of oil, natural gas, coal and
	hydro-electricity may result in lower demand for uranium concentrates and uranium conversion
	services. Furthermore, growth of the uranium and nuclear power industry will depend upon continued
	and increased acceptance of nuclear technology as a means of generating electricity. Because of
	unique political, technological and environmental factors that affect the nuclear industry, the
	industry is subject to public opinion risks which could have an adverse impact on the demand for
	nuclear power and increase the regulation of the nuclear power industry. An accident at a nuclear
	reactor anywhere in the world could impact the continuing acceptance of nuclear energy and the
	future prospects for nuclear generation, which may have a material adverse effect on Cameco.

</I>
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	The Company&#146;s principal business relates to the production and sale of uranium concentrates and the
	provision of uranium conversion services. The Company relies heavily on a small number of customers
	to purchase a significant portion of its production of uranium concentrates and its uranium
	conversion services. For instance, for the period 2005 through 2007, Cameco&#146;s five largest
	customers are anticipated to account for approximately 41% of the Company&#146;s contracted supply of
	U
<SUB>

	Uranium Industry Competition and International Trade Restrictions
</I>
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	The international uranium industry, including the supply of uranium concentrates and the provision
	of uranium conversion services, is highly competitive. The Company markets uranium to utilities in
	direct competition with supplies available from a relatively small number of world uranium mining
	and enrichment companies, from excess inventories, including inventories made available from
	decommissioning of nuclear weapons, from reprocessed uranium and plutonium derived from used
	reactor fuel, and from the use of excess enrichment capacity to re-enrich depleted uranium tails.
	The supply of uranium from Russia is, to some extent, impeded by a number of international trade
	agreements and policies. These agreements and any similar future agreements, governmental policies
	or trade restrictions are beyond the control of Cameco and may affect the supply of uranium
	available in the US and Europe, which are the largest markets for uranium in the world.
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	With respect to UF
<SUB>
	6

	conversion, the Company competes on the basis of price, location and
	service with two other full scale commercial suppliers in the western world and with additional
	supplies available from excess inventories, including inventories made available from
	decommissioning of nuclear weapons, and the use of excess enrichment capacity to re-enrich depleted

	The Company&#146;s future prospects are tied directly to the electrical utility industry worldwide.
	Deregulation of the utility industry, particularly in the US and Europe, is expected to impact the
	market for nuclear and other fuels for years to come, and may result in the premature shutdown of
	some nuclear reactors. Experience to date with deregulation indicates that utilities are improving
	the performance of their reactors, achieving record capacity factors. There can be no assurance

<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	Cameco, through subsidiaries, owns a 31.6% limited partnership interest in Bruce Power. Bruce
	Power&#146;s business is the generation and sale of electricity into the Ontario wholesale market.
	Bruce Power generates electricity from four Bruce &#147;B&#148; and two Bruce &#147;A&#148; nuclear-powered units.
	The Bruce &#147;B&#148; nuclear units and the two restarted Bruce &#147;A&#148; units have capacity to supply about 20%
	of Ontario&#146;s electricity needs. Bruce Power has about 3,600 employees.
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	Nuclear generation harnesses the energy released during controlled nuclear fission reactions to
	produce steam that is used to drive turbines to generate electricity. Nuclear generation has two
	main advantages: it is a relatively low marginal-cost production technology and it produces
	virtually no SOx, NOx, CO
<SUB>
	2
</SUB>
	or mercury. The latter advantage is increasing in
	significance as governments implement stricter air emission standards.
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	Nuclear stations have greater operational, maintenance, waste and decommissioning costs and have
	greater initial capital development costs than other generation technologies. This reflects the
	complexity of the technical processes that underlie nuclear power generation and additional design,
	security and safety precautions that are taken to protect the public from potential risks
	associated with nuclear operations. Offsetting these cost factors is the relatively low cost of
	nuclear fuel compared with fossil fuel costs. In general, Bruce Power&#146;s nuclear stations have a
	lower operating cost per megawatt-hour of electricity produced than fossil fuelled facilities.

</I>
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	In September of 2002, due to a weakened financial position, BE received financial support from the
	British government. As a condition of the agreement to provide its financial support, the British
	government required and received guarantees from certain BE subsidiaries and related companies,
	including Bruce Power. BE&#146;s weakened financial position resulted in its agreement, in late 2002, to
	sell 79.8 % of its limited partnership interest in Bruce Power to a consortium of Cameco,
	TransCanada PipeLines Limited (&#147;TransCanada&#148;), and BPC Generation Infrastructure Trust (&#147;BPC&#148;), a
	trust established by the Ontario Municipal Employees Retirement System. The Power Worker&#146;s Union
	and The Society of Energy Professionals agreed to acquire BE&#146;s remaining 2.6% limited partnership
	interest in Bruce Power.
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	On February&nbsp;14, 2003 the agreement closed, with a Cameco wholly owned subsidiary, Cameco Bruce
	Holdings II Inc., acquiring a 16.6% limited partnership interest in Bruce Power, bringing Cameco&#146;s
	total indirect limited partnership interest in Bruce Power to 31.6%. Cameco concurrently increased
	its shareholding interest in Bruce Power Inc. from 15% to 33.3%. Cameco acquired these interests
	from an affiliate of BE and paid approximately $204&nbsp;million.
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	Concurrently, TransCanada, through a subsidiary, and BPC each acquired a 31.6% limited partnership
	interest in Bruce Power and a 33 1/3% shareholding interest in Bruce Power Inc. from the same BE
	affiliate. The Power Worker&#146;s Union and The Society of Energy Professionals increased their
	collective limited partnership interest in Bruce Power from 2.6% to 5.2% as part of the same
	transaction.
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	As part of the closing of this transaction, a Cameco subsidiary, a TransCanada subsidiary and BPC
	each advanced $75&nbsp;million to Bruce Power. Bruce Power used these funds to pay $225&nbsp;million in
	deferred rent that it owed to OPG (see &#147;Overview-Bruce Power-OPG Lease&#148;). The loan is due February
	10, 2008 and bears interest at 10.5% per annum. At December&nbsp;31, 2004, the entire amount was
	outstanding.
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	The Bruce Power limited partnership agreement and certain other related documents were amended to
	give effect to the new ownership of Bruce Power following closing. Under these new arrangements,
	among other things, Cameco will continue as Bruce Power&#146;s fuel manager (see &#147;Cameco Fuel
	Management&#148;).
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	As part of the acquisition of BE&#146;s interest in Bruce Power, the consortium acquired a BE
	affiliate&#146;s 50% interest in Huron Wind L.P. (Cameco subsidiary&#146;s share is 1/3 of the 50% interest).
	Located adjacent to the Bruce site, the nine-megawatt Huron Wind L.P. wind farm officially opened
	on November&nbsp;29, 2002. OPG owns the other 50% of Huron Wind L.P.

<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	In May&nbsp;2001, Bruce Power, as tenant, signed and closed agreements to lease and operate the Bruce
	&#147;A&#148; and &#147;B&#148; nuclear powered units and related facilities in south-western Ontario with OPG and
	certain of its subsidiaries. The initial lease period expires in 2018. Bruce Power has the right
	to extend the lease and certain related agreements for up to an additional 25&nbsp;years. The lease was
	amended in January&nbsp;2002, and again in 2003 as part of the 2003 Acquisition described above (as
	amended, the &#147;Lease&#148;).
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	Bruce Power paid OPG an initial rental payment of about $552&nbsp;million, comprised of about $327
	million in cash and a $225&nbsp;million note receivable as deferred rent. As part of the 2003
	Acquisition, a Cameco subsidiary, a TransCanada subsidiary and BPC each advanced $75&nbsp;million to
	Bruce Power. Bruce Power used these funds to pay the $225&nbsp;million OPG note receivable.
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	Under the Lease spent fuel and decommissioning liabilities remain the responsibility of OPG and, as
	determined at the inception of the Lease, are covered by the existing Lease payments. The Lease
	with OPG provides for limited adjustments to the base rent every five years during the initial term
	of the Lease. These limited adjustments are based on a maximum of 50% of the value of the expected
	increase to the decommissioning costs for the Bruce Power facility discounted to January&nbsp;1, 2001,
	determined using predetermined principles and assumptions. For each year in the period 2004 to
	2008, the aggregate of these rents, subject to limited exceptions, cannot be less than $190
	million. In 2004, the aggregate of these rent payments was approximately $223&nbsp;million. There are
	no similar adjustments to the existing Lease payments with respect to spent fuel liabilities.
	Commencing in 2008, Bruce Power also has the right to terminate the Lease if the continuing
	operation of the facility is no longer economically viable, subject to a Lease termination fee of
	$175&nbsp;million, certain ongoing operational requirements during handover and certain shut-down
	conditions prior to handover. Cameco has severally guaranteed Bruce Power&#146;s performance of these
	obligations.

<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	The Bruce nuclear generating stations are located approximately 250 kilometres northwest of Toronto
	on Lake Huron. The Bruce nuclear generating stations consist of eight CANDU reactors. The four
	Bruce &#147;B&#148; reactors, with a combined net generating capacity of 3,160 megawatts, were commissioned
	between 1984 and 1987. The four Bruce &#147;A&#148; reactors, with a combined generating capacity of 3,087
	megawatts, were commissioned between 1977 and 1979 and removed from service by OPG between 1995 and
	1998. Bruce Power has returned two of the Bruce &#147;A&#148; reactors to service, with a combined net
	generating capacity of 1,500 megawatts. Bruce Power is currently undertaking a review of the
	feasibility of returning the other two Bruce &#147;A&#148; reactors to service. The four Bruce &#147;B&#148; reactors
	and two in-service Bruce &#147;A&#148; reactors give Bruce Power a net generating capacity of 4,660
	megawatts. An average capacity factor of 85% is forecast for the Bruce &#147;A&#148; and &#147;B&#148; stations during
	2005 compared to 82% achieved in 2004. The lower capacity factor in 2004 reflects the planned
	outage of all four Bruce &#147;B&#148; units in the fall of 2004 to perform an inspection of the vacuum
	building. This outage required all four units to be shut down simultaneously for approximately one
	month. This inspection is required by applicable regulatory requirements once every twelve years.

	The estimated operating life of a nuclear generating station ends when substantial capital
	expenditures are required to replace life-limiting components, such as steam generators and fuel
	channel pressure tubes, and such capital expenditures are not economically justified. (See
	&#147;Operating Life Assessment&#148;). Bruce Power estimates that the operating life of the last of the four
	Bruce &#147;B&#148; nuclear units will end about mid-2018 (based upon 201,000 effective fuel power hours for
	fuel channels) and the operating life of the two Bruce &#147;A&#148; units will end about 2009 for Unit 3 and
	2017 for Unit 4 (assuming steam generator replacement for Unit 4 in 2007). An investment by Bruce
	Power to replace steam generators, fuel channel pressure tubes and other life-limiting components
	at the end of their useful life will depend, among other things, on prevailing economic, financial
	and market conditions. If replacement of life-limiting components is not justified, Cameco expects
	that Bruce Power will continue to operate these units until their shutdown is dictated by safety or
	economic considerations. As part of its study to examine the feasibility of restarting Bruce A
	units 1 and 2, Bruce Power is also examining what improvements are needed to extended the life of

	reactors is expected to total about $265&nbsp;million, plus an additional $110&nbsp;million for sustaining
	capital and site service support areas. The capital expenditure program consists of:

	As part of its Bruce &#147;B&#148; power uprate project, Bruce Power plans to refuel the Bruce &#147;B&#148; units with
	modified fuel containing SEU beginning in 2007. The Bruce &#147;B&#148; units, with the exception of Bruce
	&#147;B&#148; Unit 6, are currently operating at 90% of maximum power based upon an operating limitation
	imposed by the CNSC. This limitation was placed on the reactors when studies revealed that
	emergency shutdown systems may not provide sufficient safety margins for certain low probability
	accidents. The derating to 90% of full power ensures that the necessary safety margin is
	maintained. (See &#147;Reactor Physics&#148;) The use of the modified fuel is intended to improve the safety
	margins of the reactors and allow them to operate at their design capacity and with the necessary
	safety margin. Approval is required from the CNSC to operate the Bruce &#147;B&#148; units with the modified
	fuel. In 2004, Bruce &#147;B&#148; Unit 6 successfully completed the first step toward restoring maximum
	power with receipt of CNSC approval to operate at 93% on the basis of improved safety margins
	attributed to completion of the first phase of the power uprate program. (See &#147;Uranium Fuel
	Conversion Services&#148; and &#147;Cameco Fuel Management&#148;). The other aspects of its power Bruce &#147;B&#148; power

	One of Bruce Power&#146;s key initiatives was the restart of two of the four laid-up units of the Bruce
	&#147;A&#148; station (Units 3 and 4). The first Bruce &#147;A&#148; unit (Unit 4) was connected to the Ontario

	, 2003, with the second (Unit 3) connected to the grid in January&nbsp;2004, and declared
	in commercial production as of March&nbsp;1, 2004. These two Bruce &#147;A&#148; units have a combined net
	generating capacity of about 1,500 megawatts. The project costs to restart Units 3 and 4 of the
	Bruce &#147;A&#148; station were approximately $725&nbsp;million. These costs were materially above the first
	forecast costs due to increased scope arising as a result of security concerns and regulatory
	requirements. There was also some unanticipated work required to assure safe startup and
	operation. As of December&nbsp;31, 2004, both Units 3 and 4 are operating at full licensed power,
	although Unit 3 has experienced some performance degradation due to the aging steam generator
	components.
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	In January&nbsp;2004, Cameco announced that Bruce Power was exploring the feasibility of restarting the
	remaining two laid-up units of the Bruce A station (Units 1 and 2). They have a combined net
	generating capacity of approximately 1,500 megawatts. They are the older of the four Bruce A units
	and have experienced the most operating time. Unit 1 was put into service in 1977 and laid up in
	1997. Unit 2 was put into service in 1977 and laid up in 1995. If a decision is made to restart
	these units, significant capital expenditures will be required because, among other things, the
	units&#146; steam generators and pressure tubes will have to be replaced and upgrades will be required
	to the units&#146; fire protection, electrical and seismic systems to bring them up to current codes.
	The feasibility study has been completed and the project plan is substantially complete. Bruce
	Power management and the Bruce Power partners are currently reviewing them and discussions are

	Operating Life Assessment
</I>
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	The initial estimated operating life for Bruce&#146;s nuclear generation units was 30&nbsp;years. OPG
	undertook a comprehensive inspection and testing program in order to ascertain the physical
	condition of its nuclear generating assets, including the Bruce units, and Bruce Power has
	continued that program, partially by way of contract with OPG. The condition of the major
	components is assessed using a variety of inspection techniques such as ultrasonic, visual and
	functional testing. These results provide engineers with an assessment of the condition of such
	components relative to original design. Repeated inspection or testing during planned outages is
	used to project remaining life. The experience of other nuclear operators is also taken into
	consideration. This information is used to update the life cycle management plans for major plant
	components. The life cycle management plans are a key input to Bruce Power&#146;s business planning
	process. Bruce Power&#146;s current operating life estimates (see &#147;- Generating Facilities&#148;) for the
	Bruce A and B units are based on the results of this program to date and on the previous operating
	history of the units. Bruce Power will continue to analyze information on the physical condition
	of its nuclear units and develop appropriate operational and maintenance activities.
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	As a key part of its 1997 Nuclear Recovery Plan, OPG has undertaken, and Bruce Power has continued
	at Bruce, an ongoing program to assess the condition of key components of the system including its
	steam generators, fuel channels and feeder pipes. As a result of these programs, Bruce Power has
	been better able to quantify equipment degradation status, such as the extent of steam generator
	tube corrosion, feeder tube wall thinning and pressure tube/calandria tube spacer location and
	relocation issues. As of December&nbsp;31, 2004, 100% of Bruce Power&#146;s steam generators (with 100% of
	the areas of the inner tubes likely to experience degradation) had been inspected and the present
	condition of these components has been ascertained with a reasonable degree of certainty. On the
	basis of the steam generator program inspection results, periodic cleaning, repairs and internal
	modifications have been deemed necessary to slow down the degradation rates and restore unit
	reliability. Bruce Power is currently implementing comprehensive operation and maintenance life
	cycle management plans at its units aimed at enabling the steam generators to operate for the
	expected life of the units. Current estimates of the steam generator life are within the estimated
	operating lives of the units. In 2003, inspections on Bruce B Unit 8 identified some erosion on
	support plates in three of the eight steam generators. Repairs were made and no damage to the
	boiler plates was detected. Inspections on the other units have found no similar conditions and
	follow-up inspections on Unit 8 did not show any further degradation.
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	Current inspections in the fuel channel program support the fuel channels lasting until the end of
	the estimated operating lives for the Bruce A and B units. Maintenance activities at Bruce to
	reposition the support springs in the fuel channels started in 2001 and are planned to continue
	through 2006 to ensure that the end of life projections are achieved.
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	Feeder pipes are part of the piping system that carries hot water between the reactor and the steam
	generators. Thinning of feeder pipes occurs to varying degrees at all of Bruce&#146;s reactors.
	Extensive inspections have been carried out to establish the current condition of the feeder pipes
	of the Bruce units. Feeder pipe thinning and degradation are phenomena common to CANDU reactors
	and are the subject of industry studies and monitoring. However, compared to other CANDU units, it
	has occurred to a lesser extent at Bruce B and Bruce A due to the derating of the units, resulting
	in less harsh operating environments. The feeder pipes are thus not expected to limit the life of
	the units, although it is expected that if the units are refurbished to extend their operating
	lives, the feeder pipes will be replaced and upgraded.
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	Cracking of feeder pipes has been experienced at two CANDU plants located outside Ontario. The
	affected sections of pipe were replaced and the units were returned to service. Bruce Power has
	not experienced any feeder pipe cracking at any of its nuclear facilities but is carrying out
	inspections during regularly planned outages. The scale of these inspections has been increased in
	response to these external events. Bruce Power is also participating in research and development
	with other CANDU operators to establish the degradation mechanisms.

	series of natural uranium fuel bundles, allowing for greater fuel efficiency. In contrast, light
	water reactors, which use enriched uranium fuel, must be shut down during refuelling which may
	require a planned outage of 15 to 30&nbsp;days every 18 to 24&nbsp;months. Both CANDU and light water
	reactors have to shut down from time to time for maintenance and repair. Notwithstanding that
	CANDU reactors can be refuelled without being shut down, the number of outage days per year for
	Bruce&#146;s CANDU reactors currently tends to be greater than the average number of outage days per
	year for light water reactors, primarily due to maintenance and repair work required for pressure
	tubes and feeders, which are not used in light water reactors.
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	Each CANDU unit is designed with a computerized reactor control system which controls reactor power
	and the transfer of heat generated in the fuel to the turbines. By changing the power level
	demanded from the control system, the unit operator can adjust the reactor power level and,
	therefore, electrical generation, from shut down to full output. The system design also permits
	on-line maintenance, with redundancy features to improve reliability. Although the normal control
	process systems are reliable and capable of shutting down the reactor, the stations have also been
	designed with separate and independent multiple fail-safe safety systems for fast reactor shutdown,
	emergency cooling and radiation containment. All of Bruce Power&#146;s reactors have two physically
	separate and independent systems designed to shut down the reactor within two seconds of being
	activated. Each of these systems is independent of the primary control systems and includes
	multiple sensors for detecting emergency conditions. The first shutdown system consists of neutron
	absorbing rods suspended above the reactor, which would fall automatically into the moderator upon
	detection of an emergency condition. The second shutdown system contains a neutron-absorbing
	solution, which would be rapidly injected into the heavy water. The primary shutdown mechanism
	consists of fast-acting neutron absorbing rods. An additional slower-acting shutdown mechanism,
	which drains the reactor moderator to a dump tank, is also present.
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	The Bruce units also have an emergency core coolant injection system which would be activated in
	the event of a pipe break in the reactor coolant system. This system would inject ordinary water
	into the cooling system to ensure that coolant continues to circulate over the nuclear fuel bundles
	to prevent them from overheating. In addition, all of Bruce Power&#146;s nuclear units have a negative
	pressure containment system. Each reactor is enclosed in a thick-walled concrete containment
	building connected to a vacuum building by a large duct. If pressure in the containment building
	exceeds operating limits, pressure relief valves would automatically open and release any
	radioactive material into the vacuum building. The negative pressure within the vacuum building,
	together with steam suppression by a dousing system, is designed to keep radioactive material
	safely contained within the vacuum building walls. Controlled venting, within permissible levels
	of release, would also be available for long-term pressure control through filtered-air discharge
	systems.

<I>
	Reactor Physics
</I>
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	The CNSC requires that Bruce Power and other nuclear operators conduct safety analysis in order to
	license reactors for operation. One of objectives of such safety analysis is to demonstrate that
	an unacceptable release of radioactivity will not occur in the event of a large break loss of
	coolant. In 1999, the CNSC requested that OPG, the prior operator of the Bruce units, use a new
	set of computer codes for performing such safety analysis. Analysis performed by OPG with the new
	codes indicated a reduction in the safety margins from those obtained with the old codes. OPG
	therefore introduced operational changes for the Bruce units that resulted in a period of operation
	at reduced reactor power output (referred to as a &#147;derate&#148;). The reduced safety margins identified
	by the amended reactor physics codes reduced operating margins and increased costs of operating the
	Bruce units.
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	The Bruce units have been maintained in a derated position because of safety margin limitations
	arising from the large break loss of coolant accident analysis. Bruce Power, along with AECL,
	Cameco and Zircatec Precision Industries Inc. (&#147;ZPI&#148;), have jointly undertaken a program to develop
	and manufacture low void reactivity fuel (LVRF)&nbsp;to restore and increase the safety margins.
	Cameco&#146;s specific role is to manufacture slightly enriched uranium (SEU)&nbsp;powder to be used in the
	LVRF. LVRF use not only restores safety margins, but has the beneficial effect of sufficiently
	increasing safety margins to allow the Bruce B units to undergo a power uprate (or power
	restoration) to its original 100% power design basis. (See &#147;Cameco Fuel Management&#148;)

	The
<I>
	Electricity Act, 1998
</I>
	(Ontario) (the &#147;Electricity Act&#148;), implements the fundamental principles
	of the restructuring of Ontario&#146;s electricity industry. These include the assurance of the
	adequacy, safety, sustainability and reliability of electricity supply in Ontario, the
	encouragement of electricity conservation and the efficient use of electricity, the protection of
	the interests of consumers with respect to prices and the adequacy, reliability and quality of
	electricity service, the establishment of an independent electricity system operator and the
	implementation of non-discriminatory access to transmission and distribution systems.

	The
<I>
	Ontario Energy Board Act, 1998
</I>
	(&#147;OEB Act, 1998&#148;) expands the jurisdiction and mandate of the
	OEB in the regulation of the electricity and natural gas markets. In its role as regulator of the
	Ontario electricity market, the OEB has broad powers relating to licensing, rate regulation and
	market supervision. The OEB is obligated to implement the Province&#146;s policy directives, including
	directives concerning conservation matters as well as those intended to address existing or
	potential abuses of market power by energy sector participants. Upon the petition of any party or
	interested person, the Province may require the OEB to review all or any part of an order that the
	OEB has issued.
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	The purposes of the Electricity Act are to: (a)&nbsp;ensure the adequacy, safety, sustainability and
	reliability of electricity supply in Ontario through responsible planning and management of
	electricity resources, supply and demand; (b)&nbsp;encourage electricity conservation and the efficient
	use of electricity in a manner consistent with the policies of the Government of Ontario; (c)
	facilitate load management in a manner consistent with the policies of the Government of Ontario;
	(d)&nbsp;promote the use of cleaner energy sources and technologies, including alternative energy
	sources and renewable energy sources, in a manner consistent with the policies of the Government of
	Ontario; (e)&nbsp;provide generators, retailers and consumers with non-discriminatory access to
	transmission and distribution systems in Ontario; (f)&nbsp;protect the interests of consumers with
	respect to prices and the adequacy, reliability and quality of electricity service; (g)&nbsp;promote
	economic efficiency and sustainability in the generation, transmission, distribution and sale of
	electricity; and (h)&nbsp;ensure that Ontario Hydro&#146;s debt is repaid in a prudent manner and that the
	burden of debt repayment is fairly distributed. The objectives of the OEB pursuant to the OEB Act,
	1998 are to protect the interests of consumers with respect to prices and the adequacy, reliability
	and quality of electricity service and to promote economic efficiency and cost effectiveness in the
	generation, transmission, distribution, sale and demand management of electricity and to facilitate
	the maintenance of a financially viable electricity industry.

	Since Market Opening, a number of amendments have been made to both the Electricity Act and the OEB
	Act, 1998 through the following legislation: Bill 58, the
<I>
	Reliable Energy and Consumer Protection
	Act, 2002
</I>
	, Bill 210, the
<I>
	Electricity Pricing, Conservation and Supply Act, 2002,

	and the
	Electricity Restructuring Act, the
<I>
	Electricity Restructuring Act, 2004
</I>
	(&#147;Electricity Restructuring
	Act&#148;) plus related regulations. Bill 58 focused on the conduct of retailers selling to consumers
	who use less than 150,000 kWh of electricity annually. This has had little direct impact on Bruce
	Power. Bill 58 also increased the investigative power of the Market Surveillance Panel (&#147;MSP&#148;). The
	changes implemented by the
<I>
	Electricity Pricing, Conservation and Supply Act, 2002
</I>
	and the
<I>
	Ontario
	Energy Board Amendment Act (Electricity Pricing), 2003
</I>
	are discussed in more detail under the
	section
<I>
	&#147;Ontario Deregulation&#148;.
</I>
	The Electricity Restructuring Act significantly restructures
	Ontario&#146;s electricity regime. The Electricity Restructuring Act was passed on December&nbsp;9, 2004 and
	many of its sections have since then been proclaimed in force. The Electricity Restructuring Act
	introduces a hybrid electricity market model &#151; a mixture of government regulation and private
	sector competition. Regulation will continue with respect to the price of electricity charged to
	certain consumers and will also apply in respect of the output of the nuclear and certain other
	plants owned by OPG. Other areas of the electricity sector will be subject to competition. The
	Electricity Restructuring Act also creates a new agency, the OPA, to oversee and facilitate
	electricity supply adequacy and conservation. The Electricity Restructuring Act also renames the
	IMO as the IESO, transfers the Market Surveillance Panel from the IESO to the OEB and further
	expands the role of the OEB. In summary, these statutes and related regulations have enacted a
	number of amendments to the regulation of the Ontario electricity market, with the most significant
	changes being introduced most recently by the Electricity Restructuring Act, details of which are
	discussed in more depth below.
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<I>
	Creation of OPA
</I>
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	The Electricity Restructuring Act creates the OPA, which is an independent, self-financed,
	non-profit corporation, charged with a mandate to ensure long-term supply adequacy in Ontario. Both
	the Minister of Energy and the OEB will oversee the OPA. The Minister of Energy will, among other
	things, set generation and conservation directives and goals, draft regulations for procurement
	contracts and settlement methodology and approve both the business plan and the budget of the OPA.
	The OEB will, among other things, approve the OPA&#146;s fees and charges (which allows the OPA to
	recover its costs and expenses), review its Integrated Power System Plan and approve the OPA
	procurement process and settlement and variance mechanisms. The IESO has been designated to collect
	the OPA fees and charges.
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	The OPA will, among other things, (i)&nbsp;assess the adequacy and reliability of electricity resources
	for the medium and long-term, (ii)&nbsp;forecast electricity demand and the potential for conservation
	and renewable energy, (iii)&nbsp;prepare an integrated system plan for generation, transmission and
	conservation, (iv)&nbsp;procure new supply, transmission, demand management and conservation either by
	competition or by contract when necessary, (v)&nbsp;promote the diversification of electricity sources
	through cleaner energy sources and technology and alternative and renewable energy sources and (vi)
	stabilize rates for certain consumers.
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	The OPA is empowered to enter into generation and transmission and procurement contracts where
	necessary. The OPA is enabled with a broad ability to recover its costs and payments associated
	with procurement contracts. The integrated power plan created by the OPA will be presented to the
	Minister and may be reviewed by the OEB to ensure that it is compliant and addresses the directives
	set by the Minister as well as being economically prudent and cost effective. The OEB may approve
	the plan or send it back to the OPA with comments for further consideration and resubmission to the
	OEB.
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<I>
	Electricity Price Adjustments
</I>
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	Regulations under the Electricity Restructuring Act will require the IESO, electricity distributors
	and retailers to make adjustments to their billing systems so that payments made by consumers
	(large loads and anyone not prescribed by regulation) are equal to the payments made to the
	generators, the OPA and OEFC. The Electricity Restructuring Act introduces a blended electricity
	price from various generation sources. Low-volume and designated consumers, on the other hand,
	will pay a price established under a regulated price plan under the jurisdiction of the OEB.
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	When determining what this regulated price will be, the OEB will likely consider such factors as
	contract prices, forecasted market price and the expected cost of electricity consumed by consumers
	to whom the rates apply, and

	have the option of purchasing their electricity from energy retailers.

<I>
	Transmission Congestion
</I>
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	The
<I>
	Electricity Act, 1998
</I>
	(Ontario) mandates non-discriminatory access to transmission and
	distribution facilities by providing that every transmitter or distributor must provide generators,
	retailers and consumers with non-discriminatory access to its transmission or distribution systems
	in Ontario in accordance with its licence.
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	A uniform market-clearing price within Ontario is calculated on a congestion-free basis.
	Settlements for generators are based on metered energy multiplied by the uniform market-clearing
	price. If transmission constraints or line losses require less expensive generation to be removed
	from production and more expensive generation to produce more electricity, the constrained
	generators will be compensated by an additional payment, which will be charged to consumers. The
	IESO collects and publishes locational pricing data to determine the extent of congestion in the
	Ontario market and will recommend whether to move to some form of congestion pricing as part of the
	market evolution process. Depending on the extent of congestion, this change could result in
	locational pricing, in which individual market clearing prices would be established for various
	locations in Ontario. Interconnections with other jurisdictions are treated as separate zones from
	the rest of Ontario and separate zone prices apply when an interconnection is constrained.
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<I>
	The IESO
</I>
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	The IESO functions both as independent system operator, ensuring overall system reliability and
	stability through control of physical dispatch, and as the clearing house for the settlement of
	spot transactions by suppliers and purchasers of electricity participating in the IESO wholesale
	market. The Electricity Restructuring Act authorizes the IESO, through its billing and settlement
	systems, to ensure that market participants will, over time, pay the true cost of electricity,
	taking into consideration the mix of regulated and market prices payable to generators and prices
	payable under amendments to the OEB Act, 1998.
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	As a result of the Electricity Restructuring Act, the IESO&#146;s duties in relation to the forecasting
	of electricity demand will be reduced to short term forecasting. The role that the IMO played in
	medium and long-term electricity planning is transferred to the OPA. The IESO will continue to
	provide information to the public regarding the current and short-term electricity needs of the
	Province and the ability of the integrated power system to meet those needs, and the Electricity
	Restructuring Act will also require that the IESO provide this information to the OPA.
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	The IESO-administered wholesale market for energy services consists of. (i)&nbsp;both physical markets,
	relating to the dispatch and pricing of electricity; and (ii)&nbsp;financial markets, which are focused
	on financial risk management associated with the exposure to spot market energy prices and to
	transmission constraints. The following chart provides an illustration of the products and services
	that are available in the IESO-administered market, as well as some additional products and
	services which may be introduced at a later date.
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	The IESO-administered physical electricity markets consist of both real-time and procurement
	markets: real-time markets for energy and operating reserve, and, if implemented, a capacity
	reserve market, and procurement markets for additional generation-related services to maintain
	reliability of the transmission grid.
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	Spot market prices in the IESO-administered real-time market fluctuate significantly as a result of
	a number of influences, including domestic market demand, operating reserve requirements,
	generation availability and the volume of imports from and exports to interconnected markets. The
	highest spot market prices are set during periods of peak demand and are typically set by plants
	with the highest marginal cost at that point in time. This is usually natural gas generators or
	facilities with limited energy generation available. During off-peak periods, spot market prices
	are generally set by plants with a lower marginal cost of production, such as coal-fired
	generation. Spikes in spot prices are very often weather and capacity driven. Due to the fact that
	the Ontario market is interconnected with other energy marketplaces, prices in Ontario are also
	influenced by conditions in those markets.
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	The IESO is conducting a consultation process on market evolution to address several key market
	design issues and implement changes, including the following: (i)&nbsp;implementation of a day ahead
	market; (ii)&nbsp;optimization of dispatch over multiple intervals rather than the current process which
	optimizes dispatch every five minutes; (iii)&nbsp;consideration of some form of locational marginal
	pricing (&#147;LMP&#148;) (LMP is used by both New York and PJM, and

	long-term resource adequacy.
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	The IESO-administered financial markets are intended to provide wholesale market participants with
	risk management opportunities through the trading of transmission rights and energy forward
	contracts.
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	Transmission rights are sold to market participants by the IESO in scheduled auctions. The
	operation of the transmission rights market is intended to provide market participants with a
	financial hedge for congestion when importing or exporting energy. Congestion occurs at a time when
	the IESO receives more bids or offers than can be accommodated given the available limits on
	transmission capacity between Ontario and the interconnected market at an inter-tie. When the flows
	of electricity are such that an inter-tie reaches its capacity, it results in variations in energy
	prices on either side of the inter-tie. Transmission rights are a financial risk management
	instrument and do not provide a market participant with priority access to transmit electricity
	across an inter-tie. Transmission rights may be purchased or sold notwithstanding that the
	purchaser or vendor is not offering to purchase or sell electricity
	across an inter-tie. They do, however, entitle a purchaser to a payment from the IESO in the event
	of congestion at the inter-tie.

<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	Under the Electricity Act, the IESO is authorized to make and enforce the Market Rules which are
	necessary to perform its function and administer the IESO-controlled market. Under the
	Electricity Restructuring Act, proposed amendments to the IESO-administered market rules will be
	reviewed by the OEB, which may revoke the amendment and refer the matter back to the IESO for
	further consideration. Each market participant is obliged to follow the Market Rules in accordance
	with its participation agreement with the IESO and its OEB licence.
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	The IESO acts as a clearing house for the settlement of spot market transactions as well as
	designated physical bilateral contracts between IESO market participants and sends invoices to
	market participants. Credit risk in the settlement process is managed by IESO rules requiring all
	authorized market participants to satisfy requirements for creditworthiness, with all participants
	sharing the risk of loss on a market participant&#146;s payment default on a pro rata basis.
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	The IESO-administered physical electricity markets include real-time markets. The spot markets for
	energy and operating reserve are both part of the real-time markets that are administered by the
	IESO. The energy market deals with offers to sell and bids to purchase electricity. Operating
	reserve is generating capacity that can be called upon or demand that can be reduced on short
	notice by the IESO, for example, to replace scheduled electricity supply that

	is unavailable as a result of contingencies such as unexpected outages of generating facilities, or
	deal with unanticipated increases in demand. The IESO establishes separate prices for the energy
	market and the operating reserve markets. The IESO jointly optimizes these two markets to produce
	dispatch instructions and prices intended to result in the most cost-effective overall solution for
	the market. The description below of how the IESO establishes the market clearing prices of
	electricity and operating reserve does not include adjustments that result from the interaction of
	the energy and the operating reserve markets. Furthermore, the following description is based upon
	the assumption that there are no constraints in the transmission system. If there are constraints
	in the transmission system, further adjustments are made to dispatch instructions and the
	compensation paid to generators.
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	In the energy market, offers to sell specified quantities of electricity at specified prices for
	each hour of a given day (the &#147;dispatch day&#148;) are made by generators in Ontario and elsewhere.
	Intermittent and small generation facilities may be designated as &#147;non-dispatchable&#148;, in which
	event they receive the market clearing price for all electricity generated by the facility, without
	the need to submit an offer to sell to the IESO. All other generators are &#147;dispatchable&#148; and are
	only dispatched if their offer is accepted.
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	Consumers may similarly submit bids that specify the maximum price that the consumer is willing to
	pay for electricity. Such consumers are considered to be &#147;dispatchable&#148;. If a consumer submits such
	a bid, when the price of electricity exceeds the price in its bid, the consumer must reduce its
	electricity usage based on dispatch instructions from the IESO. All other consumers are
	&#147;non-dispatchable&#148;. Non-dispatchable consumers do not submit bids and pay the hourly market
	clearing price for all electricity consumed by them, with the exception of those consumers who are
	prescribed to pay the regulated price.
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	Offers from generators and bids from consumers are provided to the IESO in advance of the dispatch
	day and may be changed within certain time limits. For each five-minute interval, the market
	clearing price is set by the price of the next available bid or offer that has been submitted to
	the IESO to meet the next MW of demand. This price can, therefore, be set by an offer submitted by
	a dispatchable generator or by a bid submitted by a dispatchable consumer. The IESO also
	establishes an hourly market clearing price, which is the arithmetic average of the five-minute
	interval market clearing prices during that hour. All dispatchable generators and dispatchable
	consumers whose offers or bids are accepted by the IESO receive or pay the five-minute interval
	market clearing price for electricity generated or consumed, based upon metered quantities. All
	non-dispatchable generators and non-dispatchable consumers receive or pay the hourly market
	clearing price for electricity generated or consumed by them based on metered quantities except for
	those generators that will receive, and those consumers that will pay, regulated rates.
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	The operating reserve markets establish market clearing prices that are paid to parties whose
	offers to provide operating reserve are accepted by the IESO. As mentioned above, these prices are
	affected by the interaction between the energy market and the operating reserve markets.
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	The IESO maintains the reliability of the transmission grid through ancillary services (operating
	reserve, reactive support/voltage control service, black start capability and automatic generation
	control) and must-run contracts for local reliability. Ancillary services other than operating
	reserve are purchased by the IESO through procurement markets. Must-run contracts for reliability
	can involve compensating a generator for staffing and keeping a unit in production mode as a
	support or contingency regardless of the market-clearing price on the spot market. The cost of
	providing these services is charged by the service provider to the IESO, which passes the expense
	on to consumers through uplift charges. The IESO arranges suppliers for these services through a
	competitive tendering process. Contracts are limited to terms of 18&nbsp;months or less for contracted

	In its capacity as the independent electricity system operator, the IESO entered into operating
	agreements with transmission owners who continue to operate their systems, subject to IESO
	direction and regulation by the OEB. The IESO assesses transmission system constraints in its
	dispatch of energy and manages congestion and line losses using the established Market Rules. It
	also administers the grid connection requirements applicable to market participants connected to
	the transmission system and identifies any short-term adequacy and reliability requirements by
	conducting periodic assessments. In addition, the IESO advises the OEB and participates in OEB
	proceedings that consider new transmission investment proposals. Market participants are free to
	present transmission investment proposals to the OEB at any time, with or without a supporting
	assessment from the IESO. The cost of new transmission system investments will be included in a
	network service charge unless the OEB determines that there is an identifiable beneficiary who
	should pay.

	The IESO also collects the transmission service charges designed to recover the transmission
	owners&#146; OEB-approved revenue requirements and disburses these revenues to the transmission owners.
	Consumers of significant amounts of electricity can, individually or as a group, build their own
	generation facilities and thereby avoid paying certain transmission charges. In many circumstances,
	consumer-owned generation will also allow those consumers to avoid IESO uplift charges. This can
	give rise to the construction of new generation capacity that would not be economic if it were not
	for this avoidance of transmission charges and IESO uplift charges.

	emergency circumstances exist or are imminent, such as a failure of the market system or a major
	blackout. The market cannot be suspended solely because the market price has reached the maximum
	market clearing price or some demand has been curtailed. Each market participant is required to

	Bruce Power&#146;s failure to comply with such regulation could have a material adverse effect on Bruce
	Power.
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	Risks of substantial liability, as well as the potential for significant increased costs of
	operations, arise from the management and operation of nuclear generating stations, including,
	among other things, from structural problems, increasing security requirements to cover factors
	such as physical security threats, equipment malfunctions, and the storage, handling and disposal
	of radioactive materials. Bruce Power has implemented risk management strategies, including through
	the safety systems which are a part of CANDU technology (see &#147;
<I>
	Candu Technology)
</I>
	, but there can be
	no assurance that such risks can be minimized or eliminated. An accident at a nuclear installation
	anywhere in the world or other reasons could cause the CNSC to limit the operation or licensing of
	the Bruce nuclear generation stations. Any such accident could also have an impact on the future
	prospects for nuclear generation.
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	There is no assurance that the foregoing risks and hazards will not result in damage to, or
	destruction of, Bruce Power&#146;s nuclear facilities, personal injury or death, environmental damage,

	monetary losses and potential legal liability and adverse governmental action.
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	OPG undertook a testing and inspection program to ascertain the physical condition of its nuclear
	generating stations. Under the OPG-Bruce Power Lease, Bruce Power has continued that program for
	the Bruce nuclear generating stations by contracting with OPG for the supply of steam generation,
	fuel channel and other inspection services (see &#147;Operating Life
	Assessment&#148;). As a result of this
	program, OPG identified equipment life cycle issues, such as steam generator tube corrosion, feeder
	pipe wall thinning and pressure tube/calandria tube contact. Cameco understands these conditions
	were anticipated in the design but that experience has shown that the rate of degradation is higher
	than anticipated. In addition, no nuclear generating station utilizing CANDU technology has yet
	completed a full life cycle. There can be no assurance that Bruce Power will not have to incur
	significant capital expenditures for repairs or replacements in addition to those currently
	contemplated. To address these issues, Bruce Power may need to increase preventative maintenance
	programs and allow for more outage time (a period when a nuclear reactor is not operating) than
	currently planned. Such additional repairs, replacements and longer outage times could have a
	material adverse effect on Bruce Power.

<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	Bruce Power&#146;s operations are subject to extensive government regulation that may change from time
	to time. Failure to comply with such law can subject Bruce Power to significant liabilities,
	including fines and other penalties, including the revocation of, or imposition of additional
	conditions for, its operating licences for its nuclear generation facilities. Matters that are

	Restructuring of Ontario&#146;s Electricity Industry
</I>
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	The government of Ontario retains the overall power to regulate and further restructure Ontario&#146;s
	electricity industry. Ontario&#146;s electricity market opened to competition May&nbsp;1, 2002 with the
	introduction of competition in both the wholesale and retail markets in Ontario. However, the
	Ontario government in November&nbsp;2002, March&nbsp;2003, November&nbsp;2003 and June&nbsp;2004, as described in
	&#147;Ontario Deregulation&#148;, announced regulatory changes reversing, in part, its decision to deregulate
	the electricity market. The regulatory authorities responsible for the structuring, development and
	operation of the new Ontario electricity market, the IESO and OEB, and many of the incumbent
	participants in the Ontario market, including Bruce Power, have limited operating experience in a
	competitive electricity marketplace. Accordingly, it is possible that further changes in the
	structure of electricity industry may be necessitated based on the experience of regulatory
	authorities and market participants in the new competitive environment. These changes may be
	accomplished either through fundamental changes by the government of Ontario to the structure of
	the Ontario electricity industry, or through changes made by the IESO to the market rules. In
	addition, it is difficult to predict the effect of these changing market and regulatory conditions
	on Bruce Power&#146;s business, results of operations, financial position or prospects.
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	In certain jurisdictions where the energy marketplace has been opened to competition, factors such
	as energy price volatility and episodes of supply shortages have prompted a re-examination of the
	market framework by governments, regulatory authorities and consumer groups. Examples are the
	November&nbsp;2002 announcement by the Ontario government of the price cap of 4.3 cents per
	kilowatt-hour for certain participants in the retail electricity market, the subsequent
	announcement in November&nbsp;2003 to change this price cap to 4.7 cents per kilowatt-hour and 5.5 cents
	per kilowatt-hour, depending on consumption and the most recent statutory changes in December&nbsp;2004
	which establish a hybrid market. Political, regulatory and consumer responses to the competitive
	wholesale and retail electricity markets in Ontario and the possible development of a trend toward
	re-regulation in the North American electricity industry, could have a material adverse effect on
	Bruce Power&#146;s business, results of operations, financial position or prospects.

	economic slowdown, seasonal and weather-based variations in electricity demand, the plans and
	activities of other market participants, the evolution of newly deregulated electricity markets,
	regulatory decisions in Ontario and neighbouring jurisdictions (including deregulation), the

<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	A significant portion of Bruce Power&#146;s revenues are derived from the sale of electricity under

	creditworthiness and, in certain circumstances, must supply financial assurances as security for
	non-performance. The requirement of purchasers to provide financial assurances should result in
	Bruce Power&#146;s credit risk for these sales being effectively managed. To the extent that financial
	assurances provided by such purchasers is inadequate, Bruce Power is subject to credit risk, the
	occurrence of which could have a material adverse impact on Bruce Power&#146;s expected contribution to

	Relevant Kyrgyz Law and the Investment Agreement with the Government of the Kyrgyz Republic
</I>
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	Prior to the Kumtor restructuring, the operations of the Kumtor mine and its property holdings were
	governed by a Master Agreement entered into in 1992 between Cameco, the government of the Kyrgyz
	Republic and Kyrgyzaltyn (the &#147;Master Agreement&#148;) and related agreements. These agreements
	established the applicable rules and regulations with respect to the exploitation of the Kumtor
	property, including the tenure of mineral and surface rights, operating obligations, applicable
	taxes, employment of Kyrgyz citizens and the import and export of funds, materials and gold
	produced from the Kumtor mine. Other laws and regulations of general application in the Kyrgyz
	Republic also applied to the operation of the Kumtor mine, except to the extent they conflicted
	with these agreements.
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	As part of the Kumtor restructuring, Centerra, Cameco, Kyrgyzaltyn and the government of the Kyrgyz
	Republic entered into an agreement pursuant to which, effective simultaneously with the completion
	of the Kumtor restructuring, the Master Agreement was replaced by an Investment Agreement (the
	&#147;Investment Agreement&#148;) between Centerra, Kumtor Gold Company (&#147;KGC&#148;) and the government of the
	Kyrgyz Republic. This new Investment Agreement and related agreements set out the terms and
	conditions applicable to Centerra&#146;s ongoing operation and development of the Kumtor mine and have
	continued the regime established by the Master Agreement. The Investment Agreement has a term
	lasting until the earlier of 2043 or when the Kumtor deposits are exhausted and mining is
	completed.
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	The Investment Agreement also specifies that Centerra will be subject to only those Kyrgyz tax laws
	and regulations that existed as of December&nbsp;31, 2003. This includes a profit tax of 20%, a
	withholding tax on dividends and interest of 10% and an emergency fund tax of 1.5% of the value of
	products sold.
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	Pursuant to the Investment Agreement, Centerra has the right to elect whether to be subject to any
	change in tax laws or regulations that modifies the amount or timing of tax or the manner in which
	tax liability is determined or calculated (whether or not the tax change increases or decreases
	Centerra&#146;s liability) or instead remain subject to the tax in effect prior to the change for a term
	of 10&nbsp;years from the date of the change. However, if a change in tax laws eliminates any specified
	tax in its entirety (as opposed to merely reducing a specified tax), Centerra will remain subject
	to that tax as it existed prior to its elimination.

	the People&#146;s Republic of China.
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	Pursuant to an Amended and Restated Concession Agreement (the &#147;Concession Agreement&#148;) between KGC
	(which as part of the Kumtor restructuring became a wholly-owned subsidiary of Centerra) and the
	government of the Kyrgyz Republic that became effective on the closing of the Kumtor restructuring,
	Centerra has the exclusive rights to all minerals within an area of approximately 800 hectares of
	land centred on the Kumtor gold deposits. Its mineral and surface rights for the Kumtor deposit
	extend until May&nbsp;10, 2043.
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	The Concession Agreement confirms Centerra&#146;s right to use sufficient additional surface lands for
	the purposes of the construction and occupation of all mining and milling superstructure and
	facilities, work camp and other infrastructure facilities necessary to carry out the Kumtor mine.
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	KGC must make a concession payment of $4 (US)&nbsp;for each ounce of gold sold from the Kumtor deposit,
	with such payments to be made quarterly within 90&nbsp;days of the end of each calendar quarter based on
	that quarter&#146;s gold sales by KGC. In addition, KGC must pay 2% of its net profits into a social
	development fund until its subordinated and shareholder loans outstanding as of December&nbsp;31, 2003
	are repaid and thereafter, until the end of the Kumtor operations, 4% of its net profits.
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	KGC was also granted the exclusive right to develop any mineral resources within a 7.5 kilometre
	radius from the perimeter of the Concession Area, an area covering approximately 30,625 hectares
	(the &#147;Exploration Area&#148;). This right is continued by the Investment Agreement. The Government of
	the Kyrgyz Republic has also agreed to grant Centerra any necessary mining concessions for the
	Exploration Area on substantially the same terms and conditions as for the Concession Area. In
	2005, Centerra expects to receive concessions for the Southwest Zone and other targets in the
	Exploration Area. A concession is necessary in order for Centerra to implement its plans to
	commence open pit mining at satellite gold deposit located at the Southwest Zone.
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	The Kumtor site includes an open pit mine situated at approximately 4,000 metres above sea level.
	The mine includes waste and ore stockpile areas as well as an area to dispose of the ice stripped

	$1.6&nbsp;million (US)&nbsp;for the expansion of the tailings dam.
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	Centerra identified an ice-rich silt layer beneath the tailings dam that has been the cause of some
	minor movement of the tailings dam. In 2003, in order to proactively deal with the issue, a shear
	key was constructed for 700 metres along the toes of the dam by excavating a trench approximately
	six metres deep and 20 metres wide and filling it with well-compacted granular fill. A five-metre
	berm of well-compacted granular fill was then constructed over the shear key. The shear key is
	designed to interrupt and replace an ice-rich silt layer along the downstream dam toe within the
	area of measured movement, with a high-strength stiff granular fill of sufficient width that the
	mobilized strength of the fill will eventually stop the movement.

<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	Access to the Kumtor mine site is by main road from Bishkek to Balykchy, on the western shore of
	Lake Issyk-Kul, a distance of 178 kilometres, then on a secondary road along the south shore of the
	lake to the town of Barskaun for another 150 kilometres and a final 100 kilometres into the
	Tien-Shan Mountains to reach the deposit. Considerable work has been performed to maintain this
	access road and despite occasional avalanches and movements of gravel and till down steep slopes
	during heavy rains, there has not been any extended period during which the road has been out of
	service.
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	The Kumtor mill is situated in alpine terrain at an elevation of approximately 4,018 metres, while
	the highest waste and glacier mining excavations exceed an elevation of 4,400 metres. The main
	camp, administration and maintenance facilities are at about 3,600 metres. Local valleys are
	occupied by active glaciers that extend down to elevations of 3,800 to 3,900 metres and permafrost
	in the area can reach a depth of 250 metres. The area is seismically active, as a result of the
	continuing convergence of India and Eurasia, but the Kumtor area has a relatively sparse
	distribution of historical seismicity. All facilities at Kumtor, including the process plant and
	tailings storage dam, have been designed in accordance with recommended seismic standards for the
	area.

	The climate is continental with a mean annual temperature of minus eight degrees Celsius. Extreme
	recorded temperatures vary from plus 23 to minus 49 degrees Celsius, with short summers that last
	from June to September. Precipitation is low at 300 millimetres per annum, with the majority
	falling in the summer months, and annual snow accumulation of 600 millimetres. Despite cold winter
	conditions, Kumtor is a 365&nbsp;day-per-year operation. Reflecting the harsh climate and high
	elevation, sparse, low vegetation is restricted to the valley floors and lower mountain slopes,
	with a total absence of trees or shrubs.
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	The mine site is connected to the Kyrgyz national power grid with a 110 kilovolt overhead power

	The Kumtor area has a history of intermittent exploration dating to the late 1920s. The Kumtor
	deposit was discovered in the summer of 1978 in the course of a general survey. Intensive
	exploration, adit sampling, drilling and geological interpretation work took place between 1979 and
	1989, culminating in an initial reserve statement issued by the USSR State Committee on Reserves in
	March&nbsp;1990.
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	Cameco was presented the opportunity to become involved with the Kumtor project in 1992 while
	pursuing uranium prospects in the Kyrgyz Republic. An initial agreement with the government of the
	Kyrgyz Republic was signed in December&nbsp;1992 giving Cameco the exclusive right to evaluate and
	develop the Kumtor project. A project development agreement was finalized with the government of
	the Kyrgyz Republic in May&nbsp;1994. Pursuant to this agreement, a Cameco subsidiary held an indirect
	one-third interest in KGC, a Kyrgyz joint stock company that owns the concession giving it
	exclusive rights to develop the Kumtor mine. Kyrgyzaltyn, a Kyrgyz joint stock company
	wholly-owned by the government of the Kyrgyz Republic, held the remaining two-thirds interest.
	Another Cameco subsidiary, Kumtor Operating Company (&#147;KOC&#148;), acted as operator of the joint venture

<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	The Kumtor gold deposit occurs in the southern Tien Shan metallogenic belt, a Hercynian fault and
	thrust belt that traverses Central Asia from Uzbekistan in the west through Tajikistan and the
	Kyrgyz Republic into northwestern China, a distance of more than 1,500 kilometres.
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	There are four major thrust slices comprising the mine geology, with an inverted age relationship.
	Each thrust sheet contains older rocks than the sheet it structurally overlies. The slice hosting
	the Kumtor gold mineralization is composed of Vendian (youngest Proterozoic or oldest Paleozoic)
	meta-sediments, grey carbonaceous quartz-sericite-chlorite schists or phyllites that are strongly
	folded and schistose. The fault forming the footwall contact of this structural segment is the
	Kumtor Fault Zone, a dark-grey to black, graphitic gouge zone. The fault zone strikes
	northeasterly, dips to the southeast at moderate angles and has a width of up to 30 metres. The
	adjacent rocks in its hanging wall are strongly affected by shearing and faulting for a distance of
	up to several hundred metres. The rocks in the structural footwall of the fault zone are
	Cambro-Ordovician limestone and phyllite, thrust over Tertiary sediments of possible continental
	derivation that in turn rest, with apparent profound unconformity, on Carboniferous clastic
	sediments.
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	The Kumtor gold deposit is structurally controlled on a major fault of regional importance and is a
	member of the class of structurally controlled mesothermal gold replacement deposits. The Kumtor
	gold deposit occurs where the Vendian sediments have been hydrothermally altered and mineralized
	based on structural considerations. Gold mineralization has been observed over a distance of more
	than 12 kilometres, with the Kumtor deposit itself located in what is called the Centre Block, with
	a length of 1,200 metres, a vertical range of 1,000 metres and a width of 300 to 500 metres. A
	buried intrusive body is inferred by geophysical methods to occur some five kilometres to the
	northwest of the deposit and may be the source of the mineralization process at Kumtor.

	Mineralization took place in four main pulses. An initial pulse resulted primarily in pervasive
	quartz-carbonate-albite-chlorite-sericite-pyrite alteration, with little gold of economic
	consequence being deposited. The next two pulses deposited all of economic significant gold at
	Kumtor. Feldspar makes up nearly 20% of the ore, carbonates (calcite, dolomite, ankerite and
	siderite) collectively 25 to 30%, pyrite 15 to 20%, quartz 5 to 10% and the remainder are host rock
	inclusions.
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	The gold and the gold-bearing minerals occur as very fine inclusions in the pyrite, with an average
	size of only 10 microns. This, together with the poor cyanide leach response of the gold
	tellurides, accounts for the partly refractory nature of the Kumtor ore. The refractory
	characteristics are reflected in the relatively low historic and forecasted gold recovery of around
	80%, despite the very fine grind applied to the pyrite flotation concentrate from which most of the
	gold at Kumtor is recovered by leaching. The fine grain size of the gold also renders assaying of
	this mineralization relatively reliable, with only a small nugget effect.

	Kumtor has approximately 1,600 permanent employees, of which approximately 95% are Kyrgyz citizens.
	The Kumtor deposit is mined using conventional open pit mining methods and in 2004 produced

<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	Initially, part of the orebody was overlaid by a glacial icecap 10 to 30 metres thick. The
	majority of this icecap was removed during the first three years of operation. Now mining is
	focused on ore extraction and removal of the surrounding waste rock. Operations began at the 4,290

	The milling process at the Kumtor mill reflects the fine-grained nature of the gold and its

	gold from the re-ground concentrate and from the flotation tails, with final gold recovery
	accomplished by electrowinning and refining. The mill was originally designed with a capacity to
	process 4.8&nbsp;million tonnes of ore per year, but the actual mill throughput is currently 5.5&nbsp;million
	tonnes per year. Historically, the metallurgical recovery has averaged about 80%.

<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	The Kumtor mill started processing ore in the third quarter of 1996, leading to commercial
	production in the second quarter of 1997. Through December&nbsp;31, 2004, a total of 42.4&nbsp;million
	tonnes of ore has been milled with an average gold content of 4.6 grams per tonne. The total gold
	recovered through December&nbsp;31, 2004 was 5.0&nbsp;million ounces. In addition, 378&nbsp;million tonnes of
	waste and 2.6&nbsp;million tonnes of ice had been mined for an overall strip ratio of 8.5 to 1.

	Highwall Ground Movement
</I>
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	The current pit design is a response to the July&nbsp;8, 2002 pit wall failure at the Kumtor mine, also
	known as the &#147;highwall ground movement&#148;, which resulted in the temporary suspension of operations.
	While some ground movement is common, this was a very significant and unexpected movement which
	affected the pit wall over a vertical distance of 280 metres and caused one fatality. Although
	mine production resumed seven days later in an area away from the pit wall failure, the highwall
	ground movement led to a considerable shortfall in 2002 gold production because the high-grade
	Stockwork Zone was rendered temporarily inaccessible to mining. As at December&nbsp;31, 2004, the entire
	area affected by the highwall ground movement has been mined out.
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	Following the highwall ground movement, Centerra&#146;s geotechnical consultant assessed the potential
	explanations for the pit wall failure and provided guidance with respect to remedial and long-term
	pit shape design criteria that would reduce the possibility of a recurrence. A detailed surface
	mapping program and geotechnical drilling program was designed and initiated to provide further
	information on the cause of the highwall ground movement. The evaluation of the data resulting
	from the additional investigation programs has led to a revision of the geological model in the
	area of the northeast wall and reformulated slope design criteria for the final pit. The revisions
	in the geological model centred on a zone of highly tectonized rock located in the northeast wall,
	immediately adjacent to the main Stockwork Zone. This zone of very weak rock, combined with the
	steep backscarp structure, which also approximately parallels the ore boundary fault, was the main
	cause of the failure.
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	The integration of the revised geology into the slope design process has allowed Centerra to
	develop a revised mining plan based on the geotechnical consultant&#146;s recommendations which provides
	for greater pit wall stability.

	Southeast Wall Movement
</I>
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	In February&nbsp;2004 some movement in the southeast wall of the Kumtor open pit was detected by the
	monitoring system. A crack was also discovered at the crest of the wall. The affected area of the
	southeast wall extends over a face length of 300 metres and a wall height of about 200 metres. The
	movement started in mid-February during the mining of the 4,034-metre bench and accelerated with
	subsequent mining of the 4,026 and 4,018-metre benches. Once mining of the 4,018-metre bench was
	stopped, the rate of movement recorded decreased. The southeast overall highwall slope angle is
	being lowered from 45 degrees to 42 degrees in the current pushback in this area of the open pit.
	The southeast wall area is being closely monitored until either the movement ceases or careful
	mining has unloaded the slope, resulting in minimal continuing ground movement.

	Although Cameco believes Kumtor reserve and resource estimates are unlikely to be materially
	affected by external factors, such as metallurgical, safety and environmental, permitting, legal,
	title, taxation and political issues, there can be no assurance that they will not be. There are
	numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating mineral reserves and resources. The accuracy of any
	reserve and resource estimation is the function of the quality of available data and of engineering
	and geological interpretation and judgment. Results from drillings, testing and production, as well
	as a material change in the gold price, subsequent to the date of the estimate, may justify
	revisions of such estimates.

</B>
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	The Boroo open pit gold mine, located in Mongolia, is the first significant foreign investment in
	Mongolia for industrial development since 1979. The capital cost of the project was $75&nbsp;million
	(US)&nbsp;including capitalized costs during the pre-production phase. The Boroo mill began the
	commissioning phase in November&nbsp;2003 and the mine was brought into commercial production on March
	1, 2004. For the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2004, the Boroo mine produced about 218,000 ounces of
	gold (excluding 28,000 ounces of gold produced during the commissioning period from January 1 to
	February&nbsp;29, 2004) at a total cash cost of approximately $149 (US)&nbsp;per ounce. The mineral reserve
	and resource estimates for Boroo are found at &#147;Centerra Gold Inc.-Reserves and Resources&#148;.
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	Boroo has approximately 500 employees. The proportion of Mongolian citizens in the permanent
	workforce is approximately 90% and substantial training programs have been implemented to further
	the capabilities of those employees in their current placements and to prepare them for career

	Stability Agreement
</I>
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	A Centerra subsidiary, Boroo Gold Company (&#147;BGC&#148;), entered into a stability agreement (the
	&#147;Stability Agreement&#148;) with the Mongolian government in 1998. This agreement, which was amended in
	2000 and expires in 2013, relates to BGC&#146;s operations at the Boroo gold deposit. Among other
	things, the Stability Agreement required BGC to invest a minimum of $25&nbsp;million (US)&nbsp;in development
	of the site, a condition which has been already met. In return, the Mongolian government guaranteed
	that Mongolian tax laws in effect in 1998 (when the Stability Agreement was signed) will apply to
	BGC&#146;s income from the project, unless more favourable laws take effect and the Minister of Finance
	confirms that the more favourable laws apply.
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	The Stability Agreement also provides that BGC will be exempt from all income taxes for a period of
	three years following commencement of production and will be entitled to 50% tax relief for the
	subsequent three year period.

	Property Description and Location
</I>
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	The Boroo gold project is located in the Republic of Mongolia some 110 kilometres northwest of the
	capital city of Ulaanbaatar and about 230 kilometres to the south of the international boundary
	with Russia.
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	The Mineral Resources Authority of Mongolia has granted BGC the exclusive right to all hard-rock
	minerals and placer deposits under a number of contiguous mining licences centred on and
	surrounding the Boroo gold deposit. The licences expire between 2055 and 2064.
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	Surface rights have been obtained, providing sufficient surface area for the mill and for tailings
	and waste rock disposal. Contracts are in place for the operation of the permanent camp, reagent
	storage, mining of aggregate materials, fuel storage, operation of a fuel dispensing station and
	the tailings dam. BGC must pay a 2.5% royalty on gold and silver sales to the Mongolian government
	as well as a 50% net profit royalty to Altai Trading Company Limited (which indirectly owns the
	other 5% equity interest in BGC) in respect of gold production from alluvial operations on the
	licence covering the Ikh Dashir deposit. During 2005, BGC intends to initiate mining of this
	deposit in connection with pre-stripping one of the zones of the Boroo deposit.
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	The Boroo mine site includes an open pit mine with waste and ore stockpile areas. Ore is processed
	at a crusher and mill with a capacity of 5,000 tonnes per day. There is a camp/residence for
	employees, a warehouse, maintenance shops and offices.
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	A permanent tailings facility in the Ikh Dashir River valley is connected to the process plant by a
	five-kilometre pipeline. The tailings storage facility is designed for no discharge, with all of
	the water being reclaimed for re-use in the mill. The facility received government approval in
	2003.

	Mining
</I>
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	The Boroo mining operations are based on conventional open-pit methods to mine 5,000 tonnes of ore
	per day. Mining commenced in November&nbsp;2003 with the initial ore for processing coming from Zone 2
	while the waste removal program for the higher-grade Zone 5 was in progress. Over the mine life,
	ore will be mined from four different pits. Mining is done with bench heights of five metres, with
	ore mined on half-benches for improved grade control in the flat lying ore. Waste tonnage is
	initially higher than indicated by the life of mine strip ratio of 3.9 and will incrementally
	decrease from 30,000 tonnes per day in 2004 over the mine life.

	The mill is a standard layout that consists of crushing, grinding, gravity concentration, cyanide
	leaching and gold recovery in a carbon-in-pulp circuit.
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	The mill was designed with a capacity to process 1.8&nbsp;million tonnes of ore per year (5,000 tonnes
	per day) and has consistently exceeded design throughput levels. The gravity circuit has, to the
	end of December&nbsp;2004, recovered 20% to 40% of the gold contained in ore and the overall gold
	recovery has been about 94% in accordance with the expectations based on the metallurgical

	All gold dor&#233; produced by the Boroo mine is currently exported and refined under a contract with
	Johnson Matthey plc and its Canadian affiliated company (collectively, &#147;JM&#148;). The gold is
	delivered to JM at the minesite and JM assumes the risk relating to security and transport and
	responsibility for insurance from that point to the JM refinery in Ontario. Under the contract BGC
	may elect to take physical delivery of the refined gold or to sell it to JM with an option to
	receive up to 95% of its estimated value based on mine site assays within two working days of
	delivery to the refinery, with the balance following agreement on assays.

<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	Drilling and trenching programs have successfully delineated continuous mineralized zones at the
	Gatsuurt Central Zone and the Gatsuurt Main Zone areas. Prior to 2004, most of the data for the
	two deposits was obtained by drilling that was generally restricted to the upper 75 to 100 metres
	of the deposits. During 2004, the Central Zone deposit was delineated to vertical depths of 160
	metres to 190 metres. A total of 237 diamond and RC holes totalling 32,363 metres have been
	drilled at the Central Zone, of which 185 holes were used in the resource estimate completed during
	2004. The remaining 52 holes were completed late in the year and will be incorporated in the next

	Each of International Finance Corporation (&#147;IFC&#148;) and European Bank for Reconstruction and

	was scheduled to begin in December&nbsp;2005, but IFC and EBRD had the right to delay the final
	repayment of the loans until 2015. The calculation of interest payments due under the loans was
	dependent on the performance of the Kumtor mine. Centerra entered into agreements with each of IFC
	and EBRD (the &#147;Agency Exchange Agreements&#148;) pursuant to which, in exchange for their assigning to
	Centerra the benefit of the subordinated loans, Centerra issued to each of IFC and EBRD 1,530,606

	Centerra Shareholders Agreement

<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	In connection with the Kumtor restructuring Centerra entered into a shareholders agreement with
	Cameco Gold Inc. &#147;CGI&#148;), a wholly-owned Cameco subsidiary, and Kyrgyzaltyn (the &#147;Shareholders
	Agreement&#148;) governing certain matters related to their ownership of common shares of Centerra. The
	Shareholders Agreement provides for each of Kyrgyzaltyn and CGI to meet from time to time, not less
	frequently than annually, to consider the disposition of the common shares held by them by way of
	follow-on secondary offering. Despite this agreement to consult, each of Kyrgyzaltyn and CGI may
	at any time initiate a further distribution of Centerra&#146;s common shares (subject to the lock-up
	agreements described below under &#147;Lock-up Agreements&#148;). Also, if Centerra proposes to issue any of
	its common shares by private placement or public offering, Centerra will provide CGI and
	Kyrgyzaltyn with an opportunity to sell their shares as part of the offering provided that
	Centerra&#146;s reasonable capital needs take priority.
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	For a period of five years following the date of the closing of the Kumtor restructuring, for so
	long as Kyrgyzaltyn is controlled, directly or indirectly, by the government of the Kyrgyz
	Republic, Kyrgyzaltyn or its affiliates have agreed to maintain registered and beneficial ownership
	of at least 5% of the outstanding common shares at the time of the closing of the Kumtor
	restructuring, except in the case of certain permitted takeover bids and subject to appropriate
	anti-dilution adjustments, as determined from time to time by Centerra&#146;s Board of Directors.
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	The Shareholders Agreement also addresses the voting by CGI and Kyrgyzaltyn of their shares for
	their respective nominees to Centerra&#146;s board.

	Centerra&#146;s business is sensitive to the volatility of gold prices

<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	Centerra&#146;s revenue is largely dependent on the world market price of gold. The gold price is
	subject to volatile price movements over time and is affected by numerous factors beyond Centerra&#146;s
	control. These factors include global supply and demand; central bank lending, sales and
	purchases; expectations for the future rate of inflation; the level of interest rates; the strength
	of, and confidence in, the United States dollar; market speculative activities; and global or
	regional political and economic events, including the performance of India&#146;s and the rest of Asia&#146;s
	economies.

	On March&nbsp;1, 2005 the closing price of gold on the London market (PM Fix) was $433 (US)&nbsp;per
	ounce.
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	If the market price of gold falls and remains below variable production costs of any of Centerra&#146;s
	mining operations for a sustained period, losses may be sustained and, under certain circumstances,
	there may be a curtailment or suspension of some or all of Centerra&#146;s mining and exploration
	activities. Centerra would also have to assess the economic impact of any sustained lower gold
	prices on recoverability and, therefore, the cut off grade and level of Centerra&#146;s gold reserves
	and resources. These factors could have an adverse impact on Centerra&#146;s expected contribution to
	Cameco&#146;s financial results.

	The Kumtor and Boroo mines are currently Centerra&#146;s only sources of gold production and will be
	depleted by 2010, based upon the current life of mine plans. If these reserves are not replaced,

</I>
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	On July&nbsp;8, 2002, a highwall ground movement at the Kumtor mine resulted in the death of one of
	Centerra&#146;s employees and the temporary suspension of mining operations. The movement led to a
	considerable shortfall in 2002 gold production because the high-grade Stockwork Zone was rendered
	temporarily inaccessible. Consequently, Centerra lower grade ore was milled and achieved lower
	recovery rates. See &#147;Kumtor Mine-Highwall Ground Movement&#148; for additional details describing this
	event and the actions taken in response. There has also been movement detected in the southeast
	wall of the open pit and a crack was discovered at the crest of the wall. See &#147;Kumtor
	Mine-Southeast Wall Movement&#148; for additional details describing this event and actions taken in
	response. There can be no guarantee against further ground movements. A future ground movement
	could result in a significant interruption of operations. Centerra may also experience a loss of
	reserves if it is necessary to redesign

	Centerra faces substantial decommissioning and reclamation costs which may be difficult to predict accurately
</I>
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	At each of Centerra&#146;s mine sites Centerra is required to establish a decommissioning and
	reclamation plan. The costs of performing the decommissioning and reclamation must be funded by
	Centerra&#146;s operations. These costs can be significant and are subject to change. Centerra cannot
	predict what level of decommissioning and reclamation may be required in the future by regulators.
	If Centerra is required to comply with significant additional regulations or if the actual cost of
	future decommissioning and reclamation is significantly higher that current estimates, this could
	have an adverse impact on Centerra&#146;s expected contribution to Cameco&#146;s financial results.

	Changes in, or more aggressive enforcement of, laws and regulations could adversely impact Centerra&#146;s business
</I>
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	Mining operations and exploration activities are subject to extensive laws and regulations. These
	relate to production, development, exploration, exports, imports, taxes and royalties, labour
	standards, occupational health, waste disposal, protection and remediation of the environment, mine
	decommissioning and reclamation, mine safety, toxic substances, transportation safety and emergency
	response and other matters.
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	Compliance with these laws and regulations increases the costs of exploring, drilling, developing,
	constructing, operating and closing mines and other facilities. It is possible that the costs,
	delays and other effects associated with these laws and regulations may impact Centerra&#146;s decision
	as to whether to continue to operate existing mines, ore refining and other facilities or whether
	to proceed with exploration or development of properties. Since legal requirements change
	frequently, are subject to interpretation and may be enforced to varying degrees in practice,
	Centerra is unable to predict the ultimate cost of compliance with these requirements or their
	effect on operations. Furthermore, changes in governments, regulations and policies and practices
	could have an adverse impact on Centerra&#146;s expected contribution to Cameco&#146;s financial results.

<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	The further development and exploration of mineral properties in which Centerra holds interest or
	which Centerra acquire may depend upon Centerra&#146;s ability to obtain financing through joint
	ventures, debt financing, equity financing or other means. There is no assurance that Centerra
	will be successful in obtaining required financing as and when needed. Volatile gold markets may
	make it difficult or impossible for Centerra to obtain debt financing or equity financing on
	favourable terms or at all. Centerra&#146;s principal operations are located in, and Centerra&#146;s
	strategic focus is on, Central Asia and the former Soviet Union, developing areas that have
	experienced past economic and political difficulties and may be perceived as unstable. This may
	make it more difficult for Centerra to obtain debt financing from project or other lenders.
	Failure to obtain additional financing on a timely basis may cause Centerra to postpone development
	plans, forfeit rights in Centerra&#146;s properties or joint ventures or reduce or terminate Centerra&#146;s
	operations. Reduced liquidity or difficulty in obtaining future financing could have an adverse
	impact on Centerra&#146;s expected contribution to Cameco&#146;s financial results.

	&#147;Centerra Gold Inc. &#150; Risk Factors Relating to Centerra&#146;s Business and the Gold Industry&#148;, there
	are certain risks which are generally applicable to both the uranium and gold industries, as
	outlined in the following. The risks discussed here are not all inclusive. No guarantee is
	provided that other factors will not affect the Company in the future. This discussion should be
	read in conjunction with material in other sections of this Annual Information Form, including
	Management&#146;s Discussion and Analysis (Appendix &#147;B&#148;). As the context requires for the following

	underground floods, earthquakes, pit wall failures, ground movements, tailings pipeline and dam
	failures and cave-ins; and encountering unusual or unexpected geological conditions and
	technological failure of mining methods. Cameco also contracts for the transport of its uranium
	and uranium products to refining, conversion and enrichment facilities in North America and Europe,
	which exposes the Company to transportation risks.
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	There is no assurance that the foregoing risks and hazards will not result in damage to, or
	destruction of, Centerra&#146;s gold properties and Cameco&#146;s uranium properties and refining and

<I>
	Imprecision of Reserve and Resource Estimates
</I>
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	Reserve and resource figures included for uranium and gold are estimates and no assurances can be
	given that the indicated levels of uranium and gold will be produced or that Cameco will receive
	the uranium price and gold price assumed in determining its reserves. Such estimates are
	expressions of judgment based on knowledge, mining experience, analysis of drilling results and
	industry practices. Valid estimates made at a given time may significantly change when new
	information becomes available. While the Company believes that the reserve and resource estimates
	included are well established and reflects management&#146;s best estimates, by their nature reserve and
	resource estimates are imprecise and depend, to a certain extent, upon statistical inferences which
	may ultimately prove unreliable. Furthermore, market price fluctuations in uranium and gold, as
	well as increased capital or production costs or reduced recovery rates, may render ore reserves
	containing lower grades of mineralization uneconomic and may ultimately result in a restatement of
	reserves. The extent to which resources may ultimately be reclassified as proven or probable
	reserves is dependent upon the demonstration of their profitable recovery. The evaluation of
	reserves or resources is always influenced by economic and technological factors, which may change
	over time.
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	Resources figures included herein have not been adjusted in consideration of these risks and,
	therefore, no assurances can be given that any resource estimate will ultimately be reclassified as
	proven or probable reserves.
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	If Cameco&#146;s reserve or resource estimates for its uranium and gold properties are inaccurate or are
	reduced in the future, this could have an adverse impact on Cameco&#146;s future cash flows, earnings,
	results of operations and financial condition.
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<I>
	Production Estimates may be inaccurate
</I>
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	Cameco prepares estimates of future production for particular operations. No assurance can be given
	that production estimates will be achieved. Failure to achieve production estimates could have an
	adverse impact on Cameco&#146;s future cash flows, earnings, results of operations and financial
	condition. These production estimates are based on, among other things, the following factors: the
	accuracy of reserve estimates; the accuracy of assumptions regarding ground conditions and physical
	characteristics of ores, such as hardness and presence or absence of particular metallurgical
	characteristics; and the accuracy of estimated rates and costs of mining and processing.
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	Cameco&#146;s actual production may vary from estimates for a variety of reasons, including, among
	others: actual ore mined varying from estimates of grade, tonnage, dilution, and metallurgical and
	other characteristics; mining and milling losses being greater than planned; short-term operating
	factors relating to the ore reserves, such as the need for sequential development of orebodies and
	the processing of new or different ore grades; risk and hazards associated with mining; failure of
	mining methods; natural phenomena, such as inclement weather conditions, underground floods,
	earthquakes, pit wall failures, ground movements and cave-ins; and unexpected labour shortages or
	strikes.

	Exploration and Development activities may not be successful
</I>
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	Exploration for and development of uranium properties and gold properties involve significant
	financial risks which even a combination of careful evaluation, experience and knowledge may not
	eliminate. While the discovery of an ore body may result in substantial rewards, few properties
	which are explored are ultimately developed into producing mines. Major expenses may be required
	to establish reserves by drilling, constructing mining and processing facilities at a site,
	developing metallurgical processes and extracting uranium and gold from ore. Cameco and Centerra
	cannot ensure that their current exploration and development programs will result in profitable
	commercial mining operations or replacement of current production at existing mining operations
	with new reserves. Also, substantial expenses may be incurred on exploration projects which are
	subsequently abandoned due to poor exploration results or the inability to define reserves which
	can be mined economically.

<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	Cameco&#146;s and Centerra&#146;s ability to sustain or increase its present levels of uranium and gold
	production, respectively, is dependent in part on the successful development of new orebodies
	and/or expansion of existing mining operations. The economic feasibility of development projects is
	based upon many factors, including, among others: the accuracy of reserve estimates; metallurgical
	recoveries; capital and operating costs of such projects; government regulations relating to
	prices, taxes, royalties, land tenure, land use, importing and exporting, and environmental
	protection; and uranium and gold prices, which are highly cyclical. Development projects are also
	subject to the successful completion of feasibility studies, issuance of necessary governmental
	permits and availability of adequate financing.
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	Development projects have no operating history upon which to base estimates of future cash flow.
	Estimates of proven and probable reserves and cash operating costs are, to a large extent, based
	upon detailed geological and engineering analysis. Cameco and Centerra conduct feasibility studies
	which derive estimates of capital and operating costs based upon many factors, including, among
	others: anticipated tonnage and grades of ore to be mined and processed; the configuration of the
	orebody; ground and mining conditions; expected recovery rates of the uranium and gold from the
	ore; and anticipated environmental and regulatory compliance costs.
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	It is possible that actual costs and economic returns of current and new mining operations may
	differ materially from Cameco&#146;s and Centerra&#146;s best estimates. It is not unusual in the mining
	industry for new mining operations to experience unexpected problems during the start-up phase and
	to require more capital than anticipated. These additional costs could have an adverse impact on
	Cameco&#146;s and Centerra&#146;s future cash flows, earnings results of operations and financial condition.

<I>
	Environmental, health and safety risks.
</I>
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	Cameco and Centerra expend significant financial and managerial resources to comply with a complex
	set of environmental, health and safety laws, regulations, guidelines and permitting requirements
	(for the purpose of this paragraph, &#147;laws&#148;) drawn from a number of jurisdictions. The historical
	trend toward stricter laws is likely to continue. The uranium industry is subject to not only the
	worker health, safety and environmental risks associated with all mining businesses, including
	potential liabilities to third parties for environmental damage, but also to additional risks
	uniquely associated with uranium mining and processing. The possibility of more stringent laws or
	more rigorous enforcement of existing laws exists in the areas of worker health and safety, the
	disposition of wastes, the decommissioning and reclamation of mining, milling, refining and
	conversion sites and other environmental matters, each of which could have a material adverse
	effect on Cameco&#146;s and Centerra&#146;s operations or the cost or the viability of a particular project.
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	Cameco&#146;s and Centerra&#146;s facilities operate under various operating and environmental permits,
	licences and approvals that contain conditions that must be met and Cameco&#146;s and Centerra&#146;s right
	to continue operating their facilities is, in a number of instances, dependent upon compliance
	with these conditions. Failure to meet certain of these conditions could result in interruption or
	closure of Cameco&#146;s and Centerra&#146;s facilities or material fines or penalties, all of which could
	have an adverse impact on Cameco&#146;s future cash flows, earnings, results of operations and financial
	condition.

	Governmental Regulation and Policy Risks
</I>
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	Mining and refining operations and exploration activities, particularly uranium mining, refining,
	conversion and transport in Canada and the United States, are subject to extensive laws and
	regulations. Such regulations relate to production, development, exploration, exports, imports,
	taxes and royalties, labour standards, occupational health, waste disposal, protection and
	remediation of the environment, mine decommissioning and reclamation, mine safety, toxic
	substances, transportation safety and emergency response, and other matters. Compliance with such
	laws and regulations has increased the costs of exploring, drilling, developing, constructing,
	operating and closing the Company&#146;s mines and refining and other facilities. It is possible that,
	in the future, the costs, delays and other effects associated with such laws and regulations may
	impact the Company&#146;s decision as to whether to operate existing mines, ore refining and other
	facilities or, with respect to exploration and development properties, whether to proceed with
	exploration or development. The Company expends significant financial and managerial resources to
	comply with such laws and regulations. Cameco anticipates it will have to continue to do so as the
	historic trend toward stricter government regulation will likely continue. Since legal
	requirements change frequently, are subject to interpretation and may be enforced in varying
	degrees in practice, Cameco is unable to predict the ultimate cost of compliance with these
	requirements or their effect on operations. Furthermore, future changes in governments, regulations
	and policies and practices, such as those affecting the Company&#146;s mining operations, uranium

<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	Worldwide demand for uranium is directly tied to the demand for electricity produced by the nuclear
	power industry, which is also subject to extensive government regulation and policies.
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	The development of mines and related facilities is contingent upon governmental approvals, licences
	and permits which are complex and time consuming to obtain and which, depending upon the location
	of the project, involve multiple governmental agencies. The receipt, duration and renewal of such
	approvals, licences and permits are subject to many variables outside the Company&#146;s control,
	including potential legal challenges from various stakeholders such as environmental groups,
	non-government organizations or first nations claiming certain rights with respect to traditional
	lands. Any significant delays in obtaining or renewing such approvals, licences or permits could

<I>
	Political Risk
</I>
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	Cameco&#146;s Inkai project is located in the Republic of Kazakhstan. All of Centerra&#146;s current gold
	production and reserves are derived from assets located in the Kyrgyz Republic and Mongolia. These
	three countries are developing countries that have experienced political and economic difficulties
	in recent years. Cameco&#146;s Inkai project and Centerra&#146;s mining operations and gold exploration
	activities are affected in varying degrees by political stability and government regulations
	relating to foreign investment and the mining business in each of these countries. Operations may
	also be affected in varying degrees by terrorism, military conflict or repression, crime,
	corruption, extreme fluctuations in currency rates and high inflation in Central Asia and the
	former Soviet Union.
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	The relevant governments have entered into contracts with Cameco and Centerra or granted permits or
	concessions that enable them to conduct operations or development and exploration activities.
	Notwithstanding these arrangements, their ability to conduct operations or exploration and
	development activities is subject to changes in government regulations or shifts in political
	attitudes over which they have no control.
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	There can be no assurance that industries deemed of national or strategic importance like mineral
	production will not be nationalized. Government policy may change to discourage foreign
	investment, renationalization of mining industries may occur or other government limitations,
	restrictions or requirements not currently foreseen may be implemented. There can be no assurance
	that Cameco&#146;s or Centerra&#146;s assets in these countries will not be subject to nationalization,
	requisition or confiscation, whether legitimate or not, by any authority or body. While there are
	provisions for compensation and reimbursement of losses to investors under such circumstances,
	there is no assurance that such provisions would be effective to restore the value of Cameco&#146;s or
	Centerra&#146;s original investment. Similarly, Cameco&#146;s and Centerra&#146;s operations may be affected in
	varying degrees by government regulations with respect to restrictions on production, price
	controls, export controls, income taxes, expropriation of property, environmental legislation, mine
	safety and annual fees to maintain mineral properties in good standing. There can be no assurance
	that the laws in these countries protecting foreign investments will not be amended or abolished or
	that these existing laws will be enforced or interpreted to provide adequate protection against any
	or all of the risks described above. Furthermore, there can be no assurance that the agreements
	Cameco and Centerra have with the governments of these countries, including the Investment
	Agreement and the Stability Agreement, will prove to be enforceable or provide adequate protection
	against any or all of the risks described above.
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	Cameco and Centerra have made an assessment of the political risk associated with each of its
	foreign investments and maintain political risk insurance to mitigate losses as deemed appropriate.
	However, Centerra&#146;s political risk coverage provides that on a change of control of Centerra the
	insurers have the right to terminate the coverage. If that were to happen, there can be no
	assurance that the political risk insurance will continue to be available on reasonable terms.
	Furthermore, there can be no assurance that the insurance would continue to be available at any
	time or that particular losses Cameco or Centerra may suffer with respect to its foreign
	investments will be covered by the insurance. These losses could have an adverse impact on
	Cameco&#146;s future cash flows, earnings, results of operations and financial condition if not
	adequately covered by insurance.

	The dispute resolution provision of the Investment Agreement, the Stability Agreement, the
	agreements related to Joint Venture Inkai, and HEU Commercial Agreement stipulate that any dispute
	between the parties thereto is to be submitted to international arbitration. However, there can be
	no assurance that a particular governmental entity or instrumentality will either comply with the
	provisions of these or any other agreements or voluntarily submit to arbitration. If Cameco and
	Centerra are unable to enforce its rights under these agreements, this could have an adverse effect
	on Cameco&#146;s future cash flows, earnings, results of operations and financial condition.

	Properties may be subject to defects in title
</I>
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	Cameco and Centerra have investigated their rights to explore and exploit all of their material
	properties and, to the best of their knowledge, those rights are in good standing. However, no
	assurance can be given that such rights will not be revoked, or significantly altered, to their
	detriment. There can also be no assurance that Cameco&#146;s and Centerra&#146;s rights will not be
	challenged or impugned by third parties, including the local governments, and in Canada by First
	Nations and Metis.
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	The validity of unpatented mining claims on U.S. public lands is sometimes uncertain and may be
	contested. Due to the extensive requirements and associated expense required to obtain and
	maintain mining rights on U.S. public lands, Centerra&#146;s interest in the REN property and Cameco&#146;s
	interest, held by subsidiaries, in its ISL properties may be subject to various uncertainties which
	are common to the industry, with the attendant risk that its title may be defective.
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	Although Cameco and Centerra are not currently aware of any existing title uncertainties with
	respect to any of their material properties, other than with respect to First Nation and M&#233;tis
	claims in Saskatchewan, there is no assurance that such uncertainties will not result is future
	losses or additional expenditures, which could have an adverse impact on Cameco&#146;s future cash
	flows, earnings, results of operations and financial condition.

<I>
	Counterparty/Credit Risk
</I>
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	Cameco enters into transactions to reduce the impact of fluctuations in currency exchange rates.
	These transactions expose the Company to the risk of default by the counterparties to such
	contracts. The Company manages this risk of default, or credit risk, by dealing only with
	financial institutions that meet its credit rating standards and by limiting exposures with
	individual counterparties.
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	In addition, Cameco&#146;s sales of uranium product and conversion services expose the Company to the
	risk of non-payment. The Company manages this risk by monitoring the credit worthiness of its
	customers and seeking pre-payment or other forms of payment security from customers with an
	unacceptable level of credit risk. As of December&nbsp;31, 2004, less than 1% of Cameco&#146;s forecast
	revenue under contract, for the period 2005 to 2007, is with customers whose creditworthiness does
	not meet Cameco&#146;s standards for unsecured payment terms. As well, Cameco&#146;s purchase of uranium
	product and conversion services, such as under the HEU Commercial Agreement, exposes the Company to
	the risk of the supplier&#146;s failure to fulfill its delivery commitment.
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	Although the Company seeks to manage its credit risk and purchase risk exposure, there can be no
	assurance that the Company will be successful.
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<I>
	Currency Fluctuations
</I>
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	Cameco&#146;s earnings and cash flow may also be affected by fluctuations in the US/Canadian dollar
	exchange rate. Cameco&#146;s sales of uranium and conversion services are mostly denominated in US
	dollars, while its production costs of both is denominated primarily in Canadian dollars. Cameco&#146;s
	consolidated financial statements are expressed in Canadian dollars.
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	Centerra&#146;s consolidated financial statements are expressed in US dollars. Its sales of gold are
	denominated in US dollars. As part of the consolidation by Cameco of Centerra&#146;s financial results,
	they are converted into Canadian dollars at prevailing exchange rates. As of December&nbsp;31, 2004,
	Centerra also had $62&nbsp;million of cash in Canadian currency, being part of the proceeds from its
	initial public offering.
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	Fluctuations in exchange rates between the US dollar and the Canadian dollar may give rise to
	foreign exchange currency exposures, both favourable and unfavourable, which has materially
	impacted and may materially impact in the future Cameco&#146;s financial results. Although Cameco
	utilizes a hedging program to limit any adverse effects of foreign exchange rate fluctuations,
	there can be no assurance that such hedges have eliminated the potential material adverse impact of
	such fluctuations.

	Accounting Policies
</I>
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	The accounting policies and methods utilized by Cameco determine how it reports its financial
	condition and results of operations, and they may require management of the Company to make
	estimates or rely on assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain. Cameco&#146;s financial
	conditional and results of operations are reported using accounting policies and methods prescribed
	by Canadian GAAP. In certain cases, Canadian GAAP allows accounting policies and methods to be
	selected from two or more alternatives, any of which might be reasonable, yet results in Cameco
	reporting materially different amounts. Management of Cameco exercises judgement in selecting and
	applying accounting policies and methods to ensure that while Canadian GAAP compliant, they reflect
	management&#146;s best judgment of the most appropriate manner in which to record and report the
	Company&#146;s financial condition and results of operations. Significant accounting policies to the
	Cameco&#146;s consolidated financial statements are described in Notes to such statements under the
	heading &#147;Summary of Significant Accounting Policies&#148;.

	Internal Controls
</I>
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	Internal controls over financial reporting are procedures designed to provide reasonable assurance
	that transactions are properly authorized, assets are safeguarded against unauthorized or improper
	use, and transactions are properly recorded and reported. A control system, no matter how well
	designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance with respect to the
	reliability of financial reporting and financial statement preparation.

	Key Personnel

<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	The chief executive officer and senior officers of Cameco and Centerra are critical to their
	success. In the event of the departure of the chief executive officer or a senior officer, each of
	Cameco and Centerra believe that they will be successful in attracting and retaining qualified
	successors but there can be no assurance of such success. If Cameco or Centerra is not successful
	in attracting and retaining qualified personnel, the efficiency of its operations could be
	affected, which could have an adverse impact on Cameco&#146;s future cash flows, earnings, results of
	operations and financial condition.

	Cameco&#146;s and Centerra&#146;s success depends on their ability to attract and retain qualified
	personnel.
</I>
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	Recruiting and retaining qualified personnel is critical to Cameco&#146;s and Centerra&#146;s success. The
	number of persons skilled in the acquisition, exploration and development of mining properties and
	the operation of uranium refining and conversion facilities is limited and competition for such
	persons is intense. As Cameco&#146;s and Centerra&#146;s business activity grows, they will require
	additional key financial, administrative and mining personnel as well as additional operations
	staff. The Concession Agreement relating to Centerra&#146;s Kumtor operations also requires two thirds
	of all administrative or technical personnel to be citizens of the Kyrgyz Republic. However, it
	has been necessary to engage expatriate workers for Centerra&#146;s operations in Mongolia and, to a
	lesser extent, the Kyrgyz Republic because of the shortage of locally trained personnel. It is
	also necessary for Cameco to engage expatriate and local workers for the Inkai project in
	Kazakhstan. If Cameco or Centerra is not successful in attracting and training qualified
	personnel, the efficiency of its operations could be affected, which could have an adverse impact
	on Cameco&#146;s future cash flows, earnings, results of operations and financial condition.
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">

	Prospects may suffer due to enhanced competition for mineral acquisition opportunities.
</I>
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	Significant and increasing competition exists for mineral acquisition opportunities throughout the
	world. As a result of this competition, some of which is with large, better established mining
	companies with substantial capabilities and greater financial and technical resources, the Company
	and Centerra may be unable to acquire rights to exploit additional attractive mining properties on
	terms that the Company and Centerra consider acceptable. Accordingly, there can be no assurance
	that the Company and Centerra will acquire any interest in additional operations that would yield
	reserves or result in commercial mining operations. If the Company and Centerra are not able to
	acquire such interests, this could have an adverse impact on Cameco&#146;s future cash flows, earnings,
	results of operations and financial condition.

	Cameco operates McArthur River mine and Cigar Lake development project through joint ventures with

	The authorized share capital of Cameco consists of an unlimited number of First Preferred Shares
	without nominal or par value, issuable in series (none of which are outstanding); an unlimited
	number of Second Preferred Shares without nominal or par value, issuable in series (none of which
	are outstanding); an unlimited number of common shares without nominal or par value, of which, at
	December&nbsp;31, 2004, 173,040,069 common shares were outstanding as fully paid and non-assessable
	shares and one Class&nbsp;B Share of which one is outstanding as a fully paid and non-assessable share.
	(In addition, as of December&nbsp;31, 2004 there were 4,868,670 stock options outstanding to acquire
	common shares of Cameco pursuant to the Company&#146;s stock option plan. As well, at December&nbsp;31,
	2004, Cameco had $230&nbsp;million of Convertible Debentures outstanding. This issue may be converted
	into a total of 10.6&nbsp;million common shares. See &#147;5% Convertible Subordinated Debentures&#148;.) The
	Articles of Incorporation of Cameco (the &#147;Articles&#148;) contain provisions imposing restraints on the
	issue, transfer and ownership of voting securities of Cameco. See &#147;Restrictions on Ownership and
	Voting&#148; below. The following is a summary of the material provisions attaching to these classes of
	shares.

	Common Shares

<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	Subject to the limitations described below, the holders of common shares are entitled to one vote
	per common share on all matters to be voted on by the shareholders at any meetings of shareholders
	(other than at meetings of only holders of some other class or series), and are entitled to receive
	such dividends as may be declared by the board of directors of Cameco. The common shares are
	subordinate to the rights of the holders of each series of the First Preferred Shares and Second
	Preferred Shares that may be outstanding as to payment of dividends and to the distribution of
	assets in the event of liquidation, dissolution or winding up of Cameco or any other distribution
	of the assets of Cameco among its shareholders for the purpose of winding up its affairs. The
	holders of the common shares have no pre-emptive, redemption, purchase or conversion rights in
	respect of such shares. Except as described under &#147;Description of Share Capital &#151; Restrictions on
	Ownership and Voting&#148; below, non-residents of Canada who hold common shares have the same rights as
	shareholders as residents of Canada.

<I>
	Class&nbsp;B Shares
</I>
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	The holder of the Class&nbsp;B share (the &#147;Class&nbsp;B Share&#148;), the Province of Saskatchewan, is entitled to
	receive notice of and to attend all meetings of shareholders including meetings of any class or
	series thereof but does not have the right to vote at any such meeting other than a meeting of the
	holder of the Class&nbsp;B Share as a class. The holder of the Class&nbsp;B Share does not have the right to
	vote separately as a class, except on any proposal to (i)&nbsp;amend Part&nbsp;I of Schedule&nbsp;B of the
	Articles, (ii)&nbsp;amalgamate that would effect an amendment to Part&nbsp;I of Schedule&nbsp;B of the Articles,
	or (iii)&nbsp;amend the Articles so as to alter the rights attached to the Class&nbsp;B Share. Part&nbsp;I of
	Schedule&nbsp;B of the Articles provides that (A)&nbsp;the registered office and head office operations of
	Cameco must be located in the Province of Saskatchewan (the &#147;Province&#148;), (B)&nbsp;all of the executive
	officers (vice-chairman of the board, chief executive officer, chief operating officer, chief
	financial officer and president) of the Company, except for the chairman of the board, and
	substantially all of the senior officers (vice presidents) of the Company must be ordinarily
	resident in the Province, and (C)&nbsp;all annual meetings of shareholders of the Company must be held
	at a place in the Province. The holder of the Class&nbsp;B Share is entitled to request and receive
	information from Cameco for the purpose of determining whether the provisions of Part&nbsp;I of Schedule
	B of the Articles are being complied with. The holder of the Class&nbsp;B Share does not have the right
	to receive any dividends declared by the Company. Subject to the prior rights of each series of
	First Preferred Shares and Second Preferred Shares, the holder of the Class&nbsp;B Share ranks equally
	with holders of common shares with respect to the distribution of assets in the event of
	liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company. The holder of the Class&nbsp;B Share has no
	pre-emptive, redemption, purchase or conversion rights in respect of such share. The Class&nbsp;B Share

	(Canada) as amended (the &#147;ENL Reorganization Act&#148;), contain provisions imposing

	of security only or for purposes of distribution by an underwriter, voting securities to which are
	attached more than 15% of the votes that may ordinarily be cast to elect directors of Cameco.
	Further, the votes attaching to securities of Cameco held, beneficially owned or controlled,
	directly or indirectly, by all non-residents together, and cast at any meeting of shareholders of
	Cameco will be counted or pro-rated so as to limit the counting of those votes to not more than 25%

<I>
	Enforcement
</I>
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	In order to give effect to such constraints, the Articles contain provisions for the enforcement of
	the restrictions relating to ownership and voting by residents and non-residents described above,
	including provisions for suspension of voting rights, forfeiture of dividends and other
	distributions to shareholders, prohibitions against the issue and transfer of securities and
	suspension of all remaining shareholders&#146; rights.
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	The provisions allow Cameco to require holders, proposed transferees or other subscribers for
	voting securities and certain other persons to furnish shareholder declarations as to residence,
	ownership of voting securities and certain other matters relative to the enforcement of the
	restrictions. Cameco is precluded from issuing or registering a transfer of any voting securities
	where a contravention of the resident or non-resident ownership restrictions would result.
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	If Cameco has reason to believe, whether through shareholder declarations filed with it or its
	books and records or those of its registrar and transfer agent or otherwise, that voting securities
	are held by a shareholder in contravention of the resident or non-resident ownership restrictions,
	it has the power to suspend all rights of the shareholder in respect of all securities held, other
	than the right to transfer them, not earlier than 30&nbsp;days after first sending notice to the
	shareholder, unless the voting securities so held have been disposed of by the shareholder and
	Cameco has been so advised.

<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	At the time of the Company&#146;s initial public offering in 1991, the board of directors of the Company
	established a policy of paying quarterly dividends. In December of 2004, Cameco announced that its
	board of directors approved a three-for-one stock split of its outstanding common shares, to be
	effected by way of a stock dividend. All shareholders received two additional shares for each
	shares owned on the record date of December&nbsp;31, 2004. The board of directors also approved an
	increase in the annual dividend from $0.60 to $0.72($0.24 post split) beginning in 2005. This
	policy will be reviewed from time to time in light of the Company&#146;s financial position and other
	factors considered relevant by the board of directors.

</B>
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared by management in accordance
	with Canadian generally accepted accounting principles. Management is responsible for ensuring that
	these statements, which include amounts based upon estimates and judgment, are consistent with
	other information and operating data contained in the annual report and reflect the corporation&#146;s
	business transactions and financial position.
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	Management is also responsible for the information disclosed in the management&#146;s discussion and
	analysis including responsibility for the existence of appropriate information systems, procedures
	and controls to ensure that the information used internally by management and disclosed externally
	is complete and reliable in all material respects.
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	The integrity and reliability of Cameco&#146;s reporting systems are achieved through the use of formal
	policies and procedures, the careful selection of employees and appropriate delegation of authority
	and division of responsibilities. Internal accounting controls are monitored by the internal
	auditor. Cameco&#146;s code of ethics, which is communicated to all levels in the organization,
	requires employees to maintain high standards in their conduct of the corporation&#146;s affairs.
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	Our shareholders&#146; independent auditors, KPMG LLP, whose report on their examination follows, have
	audited the consolidated financial statements in accordance with Canadian generally accepted
	auditing standards.
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	The board of directors annually appoints an audit committee comprised of directors who are not
	employees of the corporation. This committee meets regularly with management, the internal auditor
	and the shareholders&#146; auditors to review significant accounting, reporting and internal control
	matters. Both the internal and shareholders&#146; auditors have unrestricted access to the audit
	committee. The audit committee reviews the financial statements, the report of the shareholders&#146;
	auditors, and management&#146;s discussion and analysis and submits its report to the board of directors
	for formal approval.

	To the Shareholders of Cameco Corporation

<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	We have audited the consolidated balance sheets of Cameco Corporation as at December&nbsp;31, 2004 and
	2003 and the consolidated statements of earnings, retained earnings and cash flows for each of the
	years in the three-year period ended December&nbsp;31, 2004. These financial statements are the
	responsibility of the corporation&#146;s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on
	these financial statements based on our audits.
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	We conducted our audits in accordance with Canadian generally accepted auditing standards. Those
	standards require that we plan and perform an audit to obtain reasonable assurance whether the
	financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test
	basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also
	includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as
	well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	In our opinion, these consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects,
	the financial position of the corporation as at December&nbsp;31, 2004 and 2003 and the results of its
	operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the three year period ended December&nbsp;31,
	2004 in accordance with Canadian generally accepted accounting principles.

	Effective January&nbsp;1, 2004, Cameco has adopted the amendments to CICA Handbook Section
	3860 Financial Instruments. This change in accounting policy was applied retroactively
	and, accordingly, the consolidated financial statements of prior periods were restated.
	The amendments to this section address the balance sheet presentation of financial
	instruments as liabilities or equity. Accordingly, amounts previously reflected as
	equity charges are now recorded as interest expense. In addition, an increased amount
	of interest has been capitalized to property, plant and equipment. The cumulative
	effect of the change in policy on the balance sheets and statements of earnings is as
	follows:

<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="MARGIN-LEFT: 6%; TEXT-INDENT: 0%; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0%; FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	Effective January&nbsp;1, 2004, Cameco adopted the new Canadian Accounting Guideline,
	Hedging Relationships, which established new criteria for hedging relationships in
	effect on or after January&nbsp;1, 2004. To qualify for hedge accounting, the hedging
	relationship must be appropriately documented and there must be reasonable assurance,
	both at the inception and throughout the term of the hedge, that the hedging
	relationship will be effective. Effectiveness requires a high degree of correlation of
	changes in fair values or cash flows between the hedged item and the hedge. The
	adoption of this accounting guideline had no material impact on the consolidated
	financial statements.

	On September&nbsp;25, 2003 the company issued unsecured convertible debentures in the amount of
	$230,000,000. The debentures bear interest at 5% per annum, mature on October&nbsp;1, 2013, and at
	the holder&#146;s option are convertible into common shares of Cameco. The fair value of the
	conversion option associated with the convertible debentures on the date of issuance was
	$30,473,000 &#091;note 9&#093;, resulting in an effective interest rate of 6.85%. As a result of the
	change in accounting policy regarding financial instruments, the amount is reflected as
	contributed surplus. Following Cameco&#146;s three-for-one stock split on December&nbsp;29, 2004, the
	conversion price is $21.67 per share, a rate of approximately 46.2 common shares per $1,000 of
	convertible debentures. Interest is payable semi-annually in arrears on April 1 and October 1.
	The debentures are redeemable by the company beginning October&nbsp;1, 2008 at a redemption price of
	par plus accrued and unpaid interest.
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	The fair value of the outstanding convertible debentures is based on the quoted market price of
	the debentures at December&nbsp;31, 2004 and was approximately $477,250,000.
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	Cameco has a $500,000,000 five-year unsecured revolving credit facility that is available until
	November&nbsp;30, 2009. Cameco may borrow directly from investors by issuing commercial paper.
	Commercial paper outstanding at December&nbsp;31, 2004 was $166,233,000 (Cdn) (2003 - $61,419,000
	(Cdn) and $3,493,000 (US)) and bears interest at an average rate of 2.5% (2003 - 2.6%). These
	amounts are classified as long-term debt.
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	Cameco has $50,000,000 outstanding in senior unsecured debentures that bear interest at a rate
	of 7.0% per annum and will mature July&nbsp;6, 2006. Cameco also has $100,000,000 outstanding in
	senior unsecured debentures that bear interest at a rate of 6.9% per annum and will mature July
	12, 2006.
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	Cameco had issued $125,000,000 (US), 8.75% preferred securities in denominations of $25 (US)
	each due September&nbsp;30, 2047 accruing interest from the date of issuance payable quarterly
	commencing December&nbsp;31, 1998.
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	On December&nbsp;17, 2004, Cameco redeemed all of the outstanding $125,000,000 (US)&nbsp;of preferred
	securities. As a result of the redemption, Cameco recorded a pre-tax charge of $6,817,000 (Cdn)
	to net earnings &#091;note 11&#093; for the remaining unamortized portion of the issue costs.
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	Cameco has $243,200,000 ($165,900,000 (Cdn) and $64,200,000 (US)) in committed letter of credit
	facilities. Outstanding letters of credit at December&nbsp;31, 2004 amounted to $203,570,000 (2003 -
	$202,745,000). The majority of the letters of credit relate to future decommissioning and

	On December&nbsp;9, 2004, the Board of Directors of Cameco approved a split of the company&#146;s
	outstanding common shares on a three-for-one basis. The stock split was effected in the form of
	a stock dividend of two additional common shares for each share owned by shareholders of record
	at the close of business on December&nbsp;31, 2004. The company&#146;s common shares commenced trading on
	a split basis on December&nbsp;29, 2004 on the Toronto Stock Exchange and January&nbsp;7, 2005 on the New
	York Stock Exchange. All equity-based benefit plans have been adjusted to reflect the stock
	split. All share and per-share data have been adjusted to reflect the stock split. If this
	data had not been adjusted, basic earnings per common share would have been $4.89 (2003 - $3.71;
	2002 - $0.85).

	Cameco has established a stock option plan under which options to purchase common shares may be
	granted to directors, officers and other employees of Cameco. Options granted under the stock
	option plan have an exercise price of not less than the closing price quoted on the Toronto
	Stock Exchange for the common shares of Cameco on the trading day prior to the date on which the
	option is granted. The options vest over three years and expire eight years from the date
	granted. Options granted prior to 1999 expire 10&nbsp;years from the date of the grant of the option.
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="MARGIN-LEFT:2%; FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	Prior to 1999, participants were eligible to receive loans from Cameco to assist in the purchase
	of common shares pursuant to the exercise of options. The maximum term of the loans was 10
	years from the date of the grant of the related option. The loans bear interest at a rate
	equivalent to the regular dividends paid on the common shares to which the loans were provided.
	Common shares purchased by way of a company loan are held in escrow in the account of the option
	holder and are pledged as security for the respective loan until the loan has been repaid in
	full. Outstanding loans are shown as a reduction of share capital &#091;note 9&#093;.

	Cameco offers a deferred share unit plan to non-employee directors. A DSU is a notional unit
	that reflects the market value of a single common share of Cameco. In 2004, sixty percent of
	each director&#146;s annual retainer was paid in DSU&#146;s. In addition, on an annual basis directors
	can elect to receive the remaining forty percent of their annual retainer and any additional
	fees in the form of DSUs. Each DSU fully vests upon award. The DSUs will be redeemed for cash
	upon a director leaving the board. The redemption amount will be based upon the weighted
	average of the closing prices of the common shares of Cameco on the TSX for the last twenty
	trading days prior to the redemption date multiplied by the number of DSUs held by the director.
	As of December&nbsp;31, 2004, the total DSUs held by participating directors was 125,033 (2003 -
	101,484).

	Cameco makes annual grants of bonuses to eligible non-North American employees in the form of
	phantom stock options. Options under this plan are not physically granted; rather employees
	receive the equivalent value of shares in cash when exercised. Options granted under the
	phantom stock option plan have an award value equal to the closing price quoted on the Toronto
	Stock Exchange for the common shares of Cameco on the trading day prior to the date on which the
	option is granted. The options vest over three years and expire eight years from the date
	granted. As of December&nbsp;31, 2004, the number of options held by participating employees was
	288,900 (2003 - 302,400) with exercise prices ranging from $9.61 to $21.03 per share (2003 -
	$9.61 to $14.61) and a weighted average exercise price of $16.70 (2003 - $12.38).

	On March&nbsp;5, 2002, Cameco acquired a 52.2% interest in AGR Limited (AGR). AGR is an
	Australia-based exploration company whose principal asset is a 95.0% interest in the
	Boroo gold deposit located in Mongolia. The purchase price was financed with
	$12,000,000 (US)&nbsp;in cash and the contribution of a neighboring property. In exchange,
	AGR issued 240,000,000 shares to Cameco. The acquisition was accounted for using the
	purchase method and the results of operations are included in Cameco&#146;s consolidated
	financial statements from the effective date of the purchase.

	satisfied through the issuance of Centerra common shares. The acquisition was accounted
	for as a step purchase and the results of operations are included as it was already a
	consolidated subsidiary. Subsequent to June&nbsp;30, 2004, Centerra acquired the remaining
	0.1% ownership interests in AGR, making it a wholly owned subsidiary of Centerra.

	A jury action was commenced by Oren Benton on November&nbsp;28, 2000 in the State of
	Colorado, USA, against Cameco. The action claims in excess of $200,000,000 (US)&nbsp;for breach
	of contract, breach of duty of good faith and fair dealing, and tortious interference with
	contractual relations and/or business expectations. Cameco&#146;s motion to dismiss the claim
	was granted by Senior Judge Daniel B. Sparr by order filed November&nbsp;15, 2002 and Mr.
	Benton&#146;s claim was dismissed. Mr.&nbsp;Benton has unsuccessfully appealed this decision and is

	Cameco&#146;s wholly owned subsidiary, Power Resources Inc. (&#147;PRI&#148;), and two unrelated third
	parties have been sued in the United States District Court for the District of Wyoming by
	Mountain West Mines Inc. (&#147;MWM&#148;). MWM claims that PRI and the other defendants owe it
	royalties on uranium mined in the Powder River Basin of Wyoming (which encompasses the
	Highland and Smith Ranch operations). PRI&#146;s exposure consists of unpaid royalties plus
	interest, and a continuing royalty on uranium from its operations within the Powder River
	Basin of approximately four percent of the selling price. MWM has submitted an expert
	report claiming that the amount of unpaid royalties is $6,690,755 (US)&nbsp;for the period 1993
	through 2003 and the amount of interest thereon is $4,153,607 (US)&nbsp;as of January&nbsp;7, 2005. A
	scheduling order has been issued that will see this dispute go to non-jury trial on June
	20, 2005. The pre-trial discovery process continues and some depositions have been
	completed.

	The majority of revenues are derived from the sale of uranium products. Cameco&#146;s financial
	results are closely related to the long and short-term market price of uranium sales and
	conversion services. Prices fluctuate and can be affected by demand for nuclear power,
	worldwide production and uranium inventory levels, and political and economic conditions in
	uranium producing and consuming countries. Revenue from gold operations is largely dependent on
	the market price of gold, which can be affected by political and economic factors, industry
	activity and the policies of central banks with respect to their levels of gold held as
	reserves. Financial results are also impacted by changes in foreign currency exchange rates and
	other operating risks.

	To hedge risks associated with fluctuations in the market price for uranium, Cameco seeks to
	maintain a portfolio of uranium sales contracts with a variety of delivery dates and pricing
	mechanisms that provide a degree of protection from price volatility. Cameco enters into forward
	sales contracts to establish a price for future deliveries of gold and US dollars. Net realized
	gains (losses)&nbsp;on contracts designated as hedges are recorded as deferred revenues (deferred
	charges) and recognized in earnings when the related hedged transactions occur. During 2004,
	all gold instruments were closed.

	These hedge positions consist entirely of spot-deferred forward contracts. The average exchange
	rate reflects contract prices as at December&nbsp;31, 2004 to their initial maturity date which is
	earlier than the designation date in many cases. The realized exchange rate will depend on the
	forward premium (discount)&nbsp;that is earned (paid)&nbsp;as hedge contracts are extended to their final
	designation date.

	Major Customers
</B>
<BR>
<BR>
	Cameco relies on a small number of customers to purchase a significant portion of its
	uranium concentrates and uranium conversion services. During 2004, revenues from one
	customer of Cameco&#146;s uranium and conversion segments represented approximately $86,500,000
	(12%) of Cameco&#146;s total revenues. In 2003, revenues from one customer of Cameco&#146;s uranium
	and conversion segments represented approximately $97,000,000 (14%) of Cameco&#146;s total
	revenues. In 2002, revenues from one customer of Cameco&#146;s uranium and conversion segments
	represented approximately $92,000,000 (14%) of total revenue. As customers are relatively
	few in number, accounts receivable from any individual customer may periodically exceed 10%
	of accounts receivable depending on delivery schedules.

	Related Party Transactions

<BR>
<BR>
	The company purchases a significant amount of goods and services for its Saskatchewan mining
	operations from northern Saskatchewan suppliers to support economic development in the region.
	One such supplier is Kitsaki Management Limited Partnership (Kitsaki). Harry Cook, a director
	of Cameco, was the chair of the company and was also the chief of the Lac La Ronge Indian Band,
	which owns Kitsaki. In 2004, Cameco has paid Kitsaki subsidiary companies $23,100,000 (2003 -
	$18,800,000) for transportation and catering services. The transactions were conducted in the
	normal course of business and were accounted for at the exchange amount. Accounts payable
	include a balance of $800,000 (2003 - nil) resulting from these transactions.

	Writedown of Mineral Properties
</B>
<BR>
<BR>
	Under both Canadian and US GAAP, property, plant and equipment must be assessed for
	potential impairment. As of 2003 there was no longer any difference in the
	calculation of an impairment loss between Canadian and US GAAP. However, as a result
	of previous differences in the amounts of impairment losses recognized under US and
	Canadian GAAP, there is a difference in the amount of depreciation and depletion
	charged to earnings.

	Mineral Property Costs
</B>
<BR>
<BR>
	Consistent with Canadian GAAP, Cameco defers costs related to mineral properties once
	the decision to proceed to development has been made. Under US GAAP, these costs are
	expensed until such time as a final feasibility study has confirmed the existence of a
	commercially mineable deposit. In addition, since the carrying value of the mineral
	property is different under US GAAP, interest capitalization is impacted. Accordingly,
	an adjustment has been made to reduce capitalized interest by
	$1,614,000 (2003 - nil).
<BR>
<BR>
	Prior to 2004, the mineral property costs expensed under US GAAP included a provision
	for loan impairment totaling $12,642,000. Due to the recognition of reserves and the
	completion of a final feasibility study in 2004, Cameco was able to demonstrate the
	loan to be recoverable and has reversed the impairment provision.

<TD>
<B>
	Pre-Operating Costs
</B>
<BR>
<BR>
	Under Canadian GAAP, pre-operating costs incurred during the commissioning phase of a
	new project are deferred until commercial production levels are achieved, subject to
	time limitations. After such time, those costs are amortized over the estimated life
	of the project. Under US GAAP, such costs are expensed as incurred as required by
	AICPA Statement of Position 98-5, Reporting on the Cost of Start-Up Activities.
	McArthur River commercial production commenced March&nbsp;1, 2000 for US GAAP and November
	1, 2000 for Canadian GAAP.
<BR>
<BR>
	During 2004,
<B>
	$
</B>
	1,048,000
	(2003 - $17,917,000) of costs related to the restart of two
	nuclear reactors at Bruce Power were considered to be start-up costs required to be
	expensed under US GAAP. As a result of expensing these start-up costs, there is a
	difference in the capital costs recognized under Canadian and US GAAP. Accordingly,
	an adjustment has been made to reduce the amount of depreciation charged to earnings
	by $2,445,000 (2003 - nil).

	Hedges and Derivative Instruments
</B>
<BR>
<BR>
	Under US GAAP, all derivative instruments are recognized on the balance sheet as
	either an asset or a liability measured at fair value. Changes in the fair value of
	derivatives are recognized in earnings unless specific hedge criteria are met to
	qualify as a cash flow hedge. Changes in the fair value of derivatives that qualify as
	fair value hedges, are recognized in earnings in the same period as the hedged items.
	Changes in the fair value of the effective portion of a cash flow hedge are deferred
	in other comprehensive income with any ineffectiveness of the hedge recognized
	immediately on the statement of earnings.

	Cumulative Effect of a Change in Accounting Policy
</B>
<BR>
<BR>
	In 2001, the FASB issued Statement 143, Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations,
	which addresses financial accounting and reporting for obligations associated with the
	retirement of tangible long-lived assets and the associated asset retirement costs.
	The standard applies to legal obligations associated with the retirement of long-lived
	assets that result from the acquisition, construction, development and use of the
	asset. Statement 143 requires that the fair value of a liability for an asset
	retirement obligation be recognized in the period in which it is incurred if a
	reasonable estimate of fair value can be made. The fair value is added to the
	carrying amount of the associated asset. The liability is accreted at the end of each
	period through charges to operating expenses.
<BR>
<BR>
	For Canadian GAAP, the cumulative effect of the change in policy on the balance sheet
	at December&nbsp;31, 2002 is to increase property, plant and equipment by $23,000,000,
	future income taxes by $8,000,000, liabilities by $4,000,000 and opening retained
	earnings by $11,000,000. Under US GAAP no restatement is required.

	Available-for-Sale Securities

<BR>
<BR>
	Under Canadian GAAP, portfolio investments are accounted for using
	the cost method. Under US GAAP, portfolio investments classified as
	available-for-sale securities are carried at market values with
	unrealized gains or losses reflected as a separate component of
	shareholders&#146; equity and included in comprehensive income. Cameco&#146;s
	investments in Energy Resources of Australia Ltd., Batavia Mining
	Ltd. (formerly Menzies Gold NL), Tenke Mining Corp., Maudore
	Minerals Ltd. (formerly Maude Lake Exploration Ltd.), and Golden
	Band Resources Inc. are classified as available-for-sale. The
	investments in Batavia Mining Ltd. and Tenke Mining Corp. were sold
	in 2004. The fair market value of the owned investments at December
	31, 2004 is $79,785,000 (2003 - $41,428,000). The cumulative
	unrealized gain at December&nbsp;31, 2004 is $60,713,000 (2003 -
	$23,864,000).

	Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.&nbsp;123, Accounting for Stock-Based
	Compensation, establishes financial accounting and reporting standards for stock-based
	employee compensation plans. This statement defines a fair value based method of accounting
	for employee stock options. However, it also allows an entity to continue to measure
	compensation cost for those plans using the intrinsic value based method of accounting
	prescribed by APB Opinion No.&nbsp;25, which is similar to the method applied under Canadian GAAP
	and followed by Cameco prior to 2003. For periods prior to adoption, companies that continue
	to follow the intrinsic value based method must disclose pro-forma earnings and earnings per
	share information under the fair value method.

	Cameco adopted the fair value method of accounting for employee stock options with
	retroactive effect to January&nbsp;1, 2003. Pursuant to new transitional rules related to
	accounting for stock-based compensation under Canadian and US GAAP, Cameco chose to record
	compensation expense for all employee stock options granted on or after January&nbsp;1, 2003 with
	a corresponding increase to contributed surplus. Compensation expense for options granted
	during 2003 and beyond is determined based on the estimated fair values at the time of
	grant, the cost of which is recognized over the vesting periods of the respective options.

	New Accounting Pronouncements
</B>
<BR>
<BR>
	In 2004, the FASB issued Statement 151, Inventory Costs, which clarifies the accounting for
	abnormal amounts of idle facility expense, freight, handling costs and wasted materials
	(spoilage). This statement requires that these items be recognized as current-period
	charges. Cameco will adopt this standard on a prospective basis beginning January&nbsp;1, 2005
	and does not expect it will have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.

</TD>
<TD>
	In 2004, FASB issued revised FAS 123 &#147;Share-Based Payment&#148;. This amended statement
	eliminates the alternative to use Accounting Principles Board (&#147;APB&#148;) Opinion No.&nbsp;25&#146;s
	intrinsic value method of accounting, as was provided in the originally issued Statement
	123. This Statement also clarifies and expands Statement 123&#146;s guidance in several areas,
	including measuring fair value, classifying an award as equity or as a liability, and
	attributing compensation cost to reporting periods. As a result, public entities are
	required to use the grant-date fair value of the award in measuring the cost of employee
	services received in exchange for an equity award of equity instruments. Compensation cost
	is required to be recognized over the requisite service period. Compensation cost is not
	recognized for equity instruments for which employees do not render the requisite service.
	For liability awards, entities are required to re-measure the fair value of the award at
	each reporting date up until the settlement date. Changes in fair value of liability awards
	during the requisite service period are required to be recognized as compensation cost over
	the vesting period. This amended statement is effective the beginning of the first interim
	or annual reporting period that begins after June&nbsp;15, 2005. Cameco will adopt this standard
	on a prospective basis and does not expect it will have a material impact on its
	consolidated statements.

	In 2004, the FASB issued Statement 153, Exchanges of Nonmonetary Assets, which amends
	Opinion 29 to eliminate the exception for nonmonetary exchanges of similar productive assets
	and replaces it with a general exception for exchanges of nonmonetary assets that do not
	have commercial substance. A nonmonetary exchange has commercial substance if the future
	cash flows of the entity are expected to change significantly as a result of the exchange.
	Cameco will adopt this standard on a prospective basis beginning January&nbsp;1, 2005 and does
	not expect it will have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.

	Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
</B>
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	The consolidated financial statements are prepared by management in accordance with Canadian
	generally accepted accounting principles and, except as described in note 26, conform in all
	material respects with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Management makes
	various estimates and assumptions in determining the reported amounts of assets and liabilities,
	revenues and expenses for each year presented, and in the disclosure of commitments and
	contingencies. The most significant estimates are related to the lives and recoverability of
	mineral properties, provisions for decommissioning and reclamation of assets, future income
	taxes, financial instruments and mineral reserves. Actual results could differ from these
	estimates. This summary of significant accounting policies is a description of the accounting
	methods and practices that have been used in the preparation of these consolidated financial
	statements and is presented to assist the reader in interpreting the statements contained
	herein.
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
<B>
	Consolidation Principles
</B>
<BR>
<BR>
	The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Cameco and its subsidiaries.
	Interests in joint ventures are accounted for by the proportionate consolidation method. Under
	this method, Cameco includes in its accounts its proportionate share of assets, liabilities,
	revenues and expenses.
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
<B>
	Cash
</B>
<BR>
<BR>
	Cash consists of balances with financial institutions and investments in money market
	instruments which have a term to maturity of three months or less at time of purchase.
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
<B>
	Inventories
</B>
<BR>
<BR>
	Inventories of broken ore, uranium concentrates and refined and converted products are valued at
	the lower of average cost and net realizable value. Average cost includes direct materials,
	direct labour, operational overhead expenses and depreciation, depletion and reclamation.
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
<B>
	Supplies
</B>
<BR>
<BR>
	Consumable supplies and spares are valued at the lower of cost or replacement value.
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
<B>
	Investments
</B>
<BR>
<BR>
	Investments in associated companies over which Cameco has the ability to exercise significant
	influence are accounted for by the equity method. Under this method, Cameco includes in
	earnings its share of earnings or losses of the associated company. Portfolio investments are
	carried at cost or at cost less amounts written off to reflect a decline in value that is other
	than temporary.
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
<B>
	Property, Plant and Equipment
</B>
<BR>
<BR>
	Assets are carried at cost. Costs of additions and improvements are capitalized. When assets
	are retired or sold, the resulting gains or losses are reflected in current earnings.
	Maintenance and repair expenditures are charged to cost of production.
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
<B>
	Non-Producing Properties
</B>
<BR>
<BR>
	The decision to develop a mine property within a project area is based on an assessment of the
	commercial viability of the property, the availability of financing and the existence of markets
	for the product. Once the decision to proceed to development is made, development and other
	expenditures relating to the project area are deferred and carried at cost with the intention
	that these will be depleted by charges against earnings from future mining operations. No
	depreciation or depletion is charged against the property until commercial production commences.
	After a mine property has been brought into commercial production, costs of any additional work
	on that property are expensed as incurred, except for large development programs, which will be
	deferred and depleted over the remaining life of the related assets.
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	The carrying values of non-producing properties are periodically assessed by management and if
	management determines that the carrying values cannot be recovered, the unrecoverable amounts
	are written off against current earnings.

<B>
	Property Evaluations
</B>
<BR>
<BR>
	Cameco reviews the carrying values of its properties when changes in circumstances indicate that
	those carrying values may not be recoverable. Estimated future net cash flows are calculated
	using estimated recoverable reserves, estimated future commodity prices and the expected future
	operating and capital costs. An impairment loss is recognized when the carrying value of an
	asset held for use exceeds the sum of undiscounted future net cash flows. An impairment loss is
	measured as the amount by which the asset&#146;s carrying amount exceeds its fair value.
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
<B>
	Goodwill
</B>
<BR>
<BR>
	Acquisitions are accounted for using the purchase method whereby acquired assets and liabilities
	are recorded at fair value as of the date of acquisition. The excess of the purchase price over
	such fair value is recorded as goodwill. Goodwill is assigned to assets and is not amortized.
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
<B>
	Future Income Taxes
</B>
<BR>
<BR>
	Future income taxes are recognized for the future income tax consequences attributable to
	differences between the carrying values of assets and liabilities and their respective income
	tax bases. Future income tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted or substantively
	enacted income tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which temporary
	differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on future income tax assets and
	liabilities of a change in rates is included in earnings in the period which includes the
	enactment date. Future income tax assets are recorded in the financial statements if
	realization is considered more likely than not.
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
<B>
	Capitalization of Interest
</B>
<BR>
<BR>
	Interest is capitalized on expenditures related to construction or development projects actively
	being prepared for their intended use. Capitalization is discontinued when the asset enters
	commercial operation or development ceases.
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
<B>
	Depreciation and Depletion
</B>
<BR>
<BR>
	Conversion services assets, mine buildings, equipment and mineral properties are depreciated or
	depleted according to the unit-of-production method. This method allocates the costs of these
	assets to each accounting period. For conversion services, the amount of depreciation is
	measured by the portion of the facilities&#146; total estimated lifetime production that is produced
	in that period. For mining, the amount of depreciation or depletion is measured by the portion
	of the mines&#146; economically recoverable proven and probable ore reserves which are recovered
	during the period.
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	Other assets are depreciated according to the straight-line method based on estimated useful
	lives, which generally range from three to 10&nbsp;years.
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
<B>
	Research and Development and Exploration Costs
</B>
<BR>
<BR>
	Expenditures for applied research and technology related to the products and processes of Cameco
	and expenditures for geological exploration programs are charged against earnings as incurred.
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
<B>
	Environmental Protection and Reclamation Costs
</B>
<BR>
<BR>
	The fair value of the liability for an asset retirement obligation is recognized in the period
	incurred. The fair value is added to the carrying amount of the associated asset and depreciated
	over the asset&#146;s useful life. The liability is accreted over time through periodic charges to
	earnings and it is reduced by actual costs of decommissioning and reclamation. Cameco&#146;s
	estimates of reclamation costs could change as a result of changes in regulatory requirements
	and cost estimates. Expenditures relating to ongoing environmental programs are charged against
	earnings as incurred or capitalized and depreciated depending on their relationship to future
	earnings.

	Employee Future Benefits
</B>
<BR>
<BR>
	Cameco accrues its obligations under employee benefit plans. The cost of pensions and other
	retirement benefits earned by employees is actuarially determined using the projected benefit
	method prorated on service and management&#146;s best estimate of expected plan investment
	performance, salary escalation, retirement ages of employees and expected health care costs.
	For the purpose of calculating the expected return on plan assets, those assets are measured at
	fair value. On defined benefit pension plans, past service costs arising from plan amendments
	and net actuarial gains, and which exceed 10% of the greater of the accrued benefit obligation
	and the fair value of plan assets, are amortized on a straight-line basis over the expected
	average remaining service life of the plan participants. On retirement benefit plans that do
	not vest or accumulate, past service costs arising from plan amendments, and net actuarial gains
	and losses, are recognized in the period they arise. Cameco measures the plan assets and the
	accrued benefit obligation on December&nbsp;31 each year.
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
<B>
	Stock-Based Compensation
</B>
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	Cameco has three stock-based compensation plans that are described in note 17. These encompass
	a stock option plan, a deferred share unit plan and a phantom stock option plan.
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	Options granted under the stock option plan on or after January&nbsp;1, 2003 are accounted for using
	the fair value method. Under this method, the compensation cost of options granted is measured
	at estimated fair value at the grant date and recognized over the vesting period. For options
	granted prior to January&nbsp;1, 2003, no compensation expense was recognized when the stock options
	were granted. Any consideration received on exercise of stock options is credited to share
	capital.
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	Deferred share units and phantom stock options are amortized over their vesting periods and
	remeasured at each reporting period, until settlement, using the quoted market value.
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
<B>
	Revenue Recognition
</B>
<BR>
<BR>
	Cameco supplies uranium concentrates and uranium conversion services to utility customers.
	Third party fabricators process Cameco&#146;s products into fuel for use in nuclear reactors.
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	Cameco records revenue on the sale of its nuclear products to utility customers when title to
	the product transfers and delivery is effected through book transfer. Since nuclear products
	must be stored at licensed storage facilities, Cameco may hold customer owned product at its
	premises prior to shipment of the product to third parties for further processing.
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	Cameco records revenue on the sale of gold when title passes and delivery is affected.
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
<B>
	Amortization of Financing Costs
</B>
<BR>
<BR>
	Debt discounts and issue expenses associated with long-term financing are deferred and amortized
	over the term of the issues to which they relate.
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
<B>
	Foreign Currency Translation
</B>
<BR>
<BR>
	Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into Canadian
	dollars at year-end rates of exchange. Revenue and expense transactions denominated in foreign
	currencies are translated into Canadian dollars at rates in effect at the time of the
	transactions. The applicable exchange gains and losses arising on these transactions are
	reflected in earnings.
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	The United States dollar is considered the functional currency of most of Cameco&#146;s uranium and
	gold operations outside of Canada. The financial statements of these operations are translated
	into Canadian dollars using the current rate method whereby all assets and liabilities are
	translated at the year-end rate of exchange and all revenue and expense items are translated at
	the average rate of exchange prevailing during the year. Exchange gains and losses arising from
	this translation, representing the net unrealized foreign currency translation gain (loss)&nbsp;on
	Cameco&#146;s net investment in these foreign operations, are recorded in the cumulative translation
	account component of shareholders&#146; equity. Exchange gains or losses arising from the
	translation of foreign debt and preferred securities designated as hedges of a net investment
	in foreign operations are also recorded in the cumulative translation account component of
	shareholders&#146; equity. These adjustments are not included in earnings until realized through a
	reduction in Cameco&#146;s net investment in such operations.

	Derivative Financial Instruments and Hedging Transactions
</B>
<BR>
<BR>
	Cameco uses derivative financial and commodity instruments to reduce exposure to fluctuations in
	foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and commodity prices. Cameco formally documents
	all relationships between hedging instruments and hedged items, as well as its risk management
	objective and strategy for undertaking various hedge transactions. This process includes
	linking all derivatives to specific assets and liabilities on the balance sheet or to specific
	firm commitments or forecasted transactions. Cameco also formally assesses, both at the hedge&#146;s
	inception and on an ongoing basis, whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions
	are highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of hedged items. Gains
	and losses related to hedging items are deferred and recognized in the same period as the
	corresponding hedged items. If derivative financial instruments are closed before planned
	delivery, gains or losses are recorded as deferred revenue or deferred charges and recognized on
	the planned delivery date. In the event a hedged item is sold, extinguished or matures prior to
	the termination of the related hedging instrument, any realized or unrealized gain or loss on
	such derivative instrument is recognized in earnings.

	Earnings Per Share
</B>
<BR>
<BR>
	Earnings per share are calculated using the weighted average number of paid common shares
	outstanding.
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	The calculation of diluted earnings per share assumes that outstanding options and warrants are
	exercised and the proceeds are used to repurchase shares of the company at the average market
	price of the shares for the period. The effect is to increase the number of shares used to
	calculate diluted earnings per share.

	The major stages in the production of nuclear fuel are uranium exploration, mining and milling,
	refining and conversion, enrichment and fuel fabrication. Once a commercial uranium deposit is
	discovered and reserves delineated, regulatory approval to mine is sought. Following regulatory
	approval, the mine is developed, and ore is extracted and upgraded at a mill to produce uranium
	concentrate. Uranium mining companies sell uranium concentrates to nuclear electricity generating
	companies around the world on the basis of the U
<SUB>

</SUB>
	O
<SUB>
	8
</SUB>
	contained in the
	concentrates. These utilities then contract with converters, enrichers and fuel fabricators to
	produce the required reactor fuel.
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="MARGIN-LEFT: 0%; TEXT-INDENT: 0%; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0%; FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	Cameco is the world&#146;s largest uranium producer accounting for 20% of the world&#146;s production in 2004
	and backed by more than 553&nbsp;million pounds of proven and probable reserves of uranium. We have
	controlling ownership of the world&#146;s largest high-grade reserves and low-cost operations in
	northern Saskatchewan. Cameco operates four mines in Canada and the United States, as well as two
	mines under development in Canada and Central Asia.
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="MARGIN-LEFT: 0%; TEXT-INDENT: 0%; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0%; FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	The company is an integrated uranium fuel supplier with refining facilities at Blind River and
	conversion facilities at Port Hope, both located in Ontario, Canada. Uranium concentrates are
	shipped to Blind River for refining into uranium trioxide (UO
<SUB>
	3
</SUB>
	) and to Port Hope for
	conversion services. The Port Hope plant can produce 20% of the world&#146;s annual requirements of
	uranium hexafluoride (UF
<SUB>
	6
</SUB>
	) used in making fuel for light water reactors. In addition,
	Port Hope is the world&#146;s only commercial producer of natural uranium dioxide (UO
<SUB>
	2
</SUB>
	), the
	fuel used by all Canadian-designed Candu reactors. The products from these sites are used to
	produce fuel for nuclear power reactors.
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="MARGIN-LEFT: 0%; TEXT-INDENT: 0%; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0%; FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	Through its 31.6% interest in the Bruce Power Limited Partnership, which operates the Bruce Power
	nuclear generating station located in southern Ontario, Cameco generates clean electricity. Cameco
	is the sole fuel supplier to Bruce Power which leases eight nuclear power reactors, two of which
	have been out of service since 1995 and 1997. Bruce Power&#146;s operating plants have a combined net
	generation capacity of 4,700 megawatts (MW), which is enough to meet the residential and industrial
	needs of a city the size of Toronto, Ontario.
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="MARGIN-LEFT: 0%; TEXT-INDENT: 0%; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0%; FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	Cameco has a 52.7% interest in Centerra Gold Inc., which began trading on the Toronto Stock
	Exchange in June&nbsp;2004. Cameco transferred substantially all its gold assets to Centerra as part of
	the strategy to unlock the value of those assets. Centerra is a leading North American gold
	producer and the largest western-based gold producer in Central Asia. Centerra is focused on growth
	through exploration and acquisition of gold properties in Central Asia, the former Soviet Union and
	other emerging markets. Centerra operates two gold mines, located in the Kyrgyz Republic and
	Mongolia, and holds a number of exploration properties in Asia and North America.

	The nuclear industry is experiencing stable growth in the form of capacity factor improvements,

	determine which factors will dominate the outlook for nuclear in the long term. However, the demand
	for nuclear power is expected to grow even more significantly as increasing electricity demand, the
	need for non-emitting baseload energy and security of supply begin to take hold globally.
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="MARGIN-LEFT: 0%; TEXT-INDENT: 0%; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0%; FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	Overall, these indicators are expected to support a stable demand trend for uranium and conversion

	Worldwide Uranium Supply and Demand
</B>
<BR>
<BR>
	The uranium market supply and demand fundamentals continued to strengthen in 2004, indicating
	a need for more primary mine production over the coming decade. During the past 20&nbsp;years, uranium
	consumption has exceeded mine production by a wide margin, with the difference being made up by
	secondary supply sources such as various types of inventory and recycled products. While there are
	still inventories, they are considerably reduced and more may be classified as strategic rather
	than excess.
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="MARGIN-LEFT: 0%; TEXT-INDENT: 0%; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0%; FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	In 2003, there were uranium production interruptions and supply announcements that caused utilities
	to re-examine their policy of maintaining low inventories. In addition, the weakening US dollar
	(compared to the currencies of almost all producer countries) meant that producers were realizing
	less revenue for each pound of uranium sold in US dollars. These factors contributed to the
	escalation of uranium prices in the last four months of 2003. In 2004, this upward trend
	continued, with spot prices increasing by 43% and long-term price indicators rising by 61%.
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="MARGIN-LEFT: 0%; TEXT-INDENT: 0%; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0%; FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	However, for the most part, the strengthening uranium price reflects tightening supply and the
	recognition that new investment is needed to encourage exploration for additional reserves and to
	build new mines. Much of the known world uranium resources cannot be economically brought into
	production without higher prices. And due to low uranium prices over the past two decades, little
	exploration has been conducted. As a result of this under-investment in exploration, very few new
	discoveries have been made. Even with the production from these potential mines, there could be
	periods of supply tightness causing uranium prices to become quite volatile.
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="MARGIN-LEFT: 0%; TEXT-INDENT: 0%; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0%; FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	Sustained prices higher than what have been experienced over the past 10 to 20&nbsp;years are needed to
	ensure that production expands to meet growing requirements. We believe that over the next 10 to 20
	years, increased exploration and development will ensure enough uranium will be found and developed
	to supply an expanding nuclear power industry. Cameco is positioned to benefit

	Uranium Demand
<BR>
<BR>
</B>
	Current nuclear power trends are generally positive. However, it is difficult to know whether
	these trends and the national debates on the long-term future of nuclear power will result in more
	or less favourable conditions for the nuclear industry. New plant construction, improved reactor
	operations, uprates and the extension of reactor lives make it highly likely that, at a minimum,
	the current demand for uranium will continue for several decades. In the near term, perceptions
	that uranium supplies are ample are beginning to change as excess inventories decline. Uranium
	prices have responded as spot prices rose during 2004 to $20.60 (US)&nbsp;per pound from $14.45 (US)&nbsp;a
	year earlier. As inventories continue to decrease, it is expected that uranium prices will more
	closely reflect the cost of primary mine production, including a reasonable return on new
	investment.
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="MARGIN-LEFT: 0%; TEXT-INDENT: 0%; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0%; FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	World uranium consumption totalled about 180&nbsp;million pounds in 2004. Of that, western world
	consumption was about 159&nbsp;million pounds, up from an estimated 155&nbsp;million pounds largely as a
	result of members being added to the European Union. Cameco estimates that annual world uranium
	consumption will reach almost 210&nbsp;million pounds in 2014, reflecting an annual growth rate of 1.7%.
	Demand in Russia, Eastern Europe and China was about 21&nbsp;million pounds in 2004 and is expected to
	increase to about 35&nbsp;million pounds in 2014. Western world consumption is expected to increase to
	175&nbsp;million pounds in the 10-year period. In 2005, world demand is expected to increase to about
	184&nbsp;million pounds while western world demand is forecast to rise to 162&nbsp;million pounds.
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="MARGIN-LEFT: 0%; TEXT-INDENT: 0%; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0%; FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	In 2004, eight reactors were connected to electricity grids, two each in South Korea and Ukraine,
	and one each in China, Japan, Russia and Canada. Three of these entered commercial operation in
	2004, with the remainder expected in 2005. There were five closures in 2004, four in the United
	Kingdom and one in Lithuania. The net result was a 6.2 gigawatt (GWe) increase in world nuclear
	capacity.

	In 2004, the world&#146;s major uranium producers continued to be affected by the weakening US dollar.
	While most uranium is sold in US dollars, most of the world&#146;s production comes from outside the US.
	Uranium spot prices increased by 43% in 2004 and uranium long-term prices by 61%, but this was
	somewhat offset by the strength of other currencies against the US dollar. For example, the uranium
	spot price only increased by 33% in Canadian dollars in 2004, 37% in Australian dollars, and 22% in

	Secondary Sources
<BR>
<BR>
</B>
	Secondary sources of supply consist of surplus military materials, excess inventory and recycled
	products. Recycled products include reprocessed uranium, mixed oxide fuel and re-enriched tails
	material. Some utilities use reprocessed uranium and mixed oxide fuel from used reactor fuel. In
	recent years, another source of supply has been re-enriched depleted uranium tails generated using
	excess enrichment capacity. We estimate that these recycled products will account for about 8% of
	western world demand over the next 10&nbsp;years. With the exception of recycled material, secondary
	supplies are finite. Recycled products are currently a high-cost fuel alternative and are used by
	utilities in only a few countries.
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="MARGIN-LEFT: 0%; TEXT-INDENT: 0%; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0%; FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	One of the largest sources of secondary supply is the uranium derived from Russian highly enriched
	uranium (HEU). As a result of the 1993 HEU agreement between the US and Russia to reduce the number
	of nuclear weapons, additional supplies of uranium have been available to the market. Under the
	20-year agreement, weapons-grade HEU is blended down in Russia to low enriched uranium (LEU)
	capable of being used in western world nuclear power plants. Uranium derived from Russian HEU could
	meet 11% of western world demand over the next 10&nbsp;years.
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="MARGIN-LEFT: 0%; TEXT-INDENT: 0%; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0%; FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	The other large source of secondary supply is excess inventories. Prior to 1985, uranium mine
	production exceeded reactor requirements due, in large part, to government incentive programs that
	anticipated rapid growth of nuclear generated electricity. The result was a buildup of large
	inventories, both in the commercial and government sectors. Over the past 20&nbsp;years, uranium mine
	production has been less than annual requirements and the company believes that most of these
	inventories have been consumed.
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="MARGIN-LEFT: 0%; TEXT-INDENT: 0%; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0%; FONT-SIZE: 10PT">

	Uranium Markets
</B>
<BR>
<BR>
	Utilities secure the majority of their uranium requirements (80% to 90% in recent years) by
	entering into medium-term (three to five years) and long-term (more than five years) contracts with
	uranium suppliers. These contracts usually provide for deliveries to begin two to three years after
	contracts are finalized. In awarding contracts, utilities consider the commercial terms offered,
	including price, and the producer&#146;s record of performance and uranium reserves.
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="MARGIN-LEFT: 0%; TEXT-INDENT: 0%; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0%; FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	There are a number of pricing formulas, including base prices adjusted by inflation indices,
	reference prices (generally spot price indicators but also long-term reference prices) and annual
	price negotiations. Many contracts also contain floor prices, ceiling prices and other negotiated
	provisions that affect the amount ultimately paid.
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="MARGIN-LEFT: 0%; TEXT-INDENT: 0%; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0%; FONT-SIZE: 10PT">

	market. In 2004, about 88% of spot market transactions were conducted off-market as buyers
	attempted to minimize upward pressure on prices. Discretionary buying represented a higher
	proportion of spot buying in 2004 than in 2003, indicating that some market participants anticipate
	continued spot price increases.
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="MARGIN-LEFT: 0%; TEXT-INDENT: 0%; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0%; FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	Over 2004, the spot price increased by 43% to end the year at $20.60 (US)&nbsp;per pound of uranium.
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="MARGIN-LEFT: 0%; TEXT-INDENT: 0%; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0%; FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	Looking to 2005, we expect spot uranium demand to be about the same level as 2004. Utilities&#146;
	requirements are generally well covered for 2005 and early 2006. Where uncovered requirements
	exist, Cameco expects utilities will, to the extent they can, take advantage of upward quantity
	flexibilities under older, lower priced contracts, rather than come to the spot market.
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="MARGIN-LEFT: 0%; TEXT-INDENT: 0%; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0%; FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	The recent trend of spot transactions being conducted quietly off-market is expected to continue in
	2005. As was the case in 2004, there are a limited number of sellers with supply available for sale
	in the spot market in 2005.

	Long-Term Uranium Market
</B>
<BR>
<BR>
	Long-term contracting in 2004 is estimated to have been about 90&nbsp;million pounds of uranium, an
	increase over the 75&nbsp;million pounds estimated for 2003.
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="MARGIN-LEFT: 0%; TEXT-INDENT: 0%; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0%; FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	The industry average long-term price (according to industry sources TradeTech and Ux) on December
	31, 2004 was $25.00 (US)&nbsp;per pound of uranium, up from $23.00 (US)&nbsp;at the end of the third quarter,
	and $15.50 (US)&nbsp;at the end of 2003.
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="MARGIN-LEFT: 0%; TEXT-INDENT: 0%; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0%; FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	We expect long-term contracting activity in 2005 will remain at about this level, as those
	utilities that have attempted to wait for prices to decline will be required to go to the market to
	begin filling uncovered requirements.
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="MARGIN-LEFT: 0%; TEXT-INDENT: 0%; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0%; FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	Dynamics have shifted to a more seller-oriented market, and we expect sellers will increasingly
	prefer to enter into longer-term deals. At the same time, some utilities, in particular those that
	are looking at the market fundamentals more strategically, and are concerned about supply beyond
	the end of this decade, are also interested in entering into longer-term contracts with sellers
	that can offer reliable supply over the longer term.

	Prices &#151; Spot/Long-Term
<BR>
<BR>
	Background
</B>
<BR>
<BR>
	While Cameco generally does not sell uranium in the spot market, about 60% of the company&#146;s uranium
	under its long-term contracts is sold at prices that reference the spot market price near the time
	of delivery. The remaining 40% is sold at fixed prices or base prices escalated by an inflation
	index. Uranium is priced in US dollars per pound U
<SUB>
	3
</SUB>
	O
<SUB>
	8
</SUB>
	.
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="MARGIN-LEFT: 0%; TEXT-INDENT: 0%; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0%; FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	Most of the company&#146;s spot market-related contracts were entered into a number of years ago when
	the average spot price was half the 2004&nbsp;year-end price of $20.60 (US)&nbsp;per pound. These contracts
	generally contain ceiling prices. Due to the rapid increase in the uranium spot price in the latter
	part of 2003 and in 2004, a number of spot-market-related contracts reached ceiling prices. The
	impact of ceiling prices became significant as the spot price moved into the $14.00 (US)&nbsp;range.
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="MARGIN-LEFT: 0%; TEXT-INDENT: 0%; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0%; FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	Many of Cameco&#146;s fixed/base-price contracts were also entered into during the same period, when the
	long-term price indicator averaged less than $11.00 (US)&nbsp;per pound compared to the 2004 average of
	more than $20.00 (US)&nbsp;per pound. Long-term price indicators provide guidance on the level of fixed
	prices being signed in the long-term contract market. As a result, some of Cameco&#146;s current
	fixed-price contracts reflect the low long-term prices from the earlier periods.
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="MARGIN-LEFT: 0%; TEXT-INDENT: 0%; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0%; FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	The benefit of improved spot prices was partially offset by a less favourable foreign exchange
	rate. As a result, Cameco&#146;s average realized price for uranium sales was $12.89 (US)&nbsp;per pound of
	uranium compared to an average spot price of $18.60 (US)&nbsp;and average long-term price of $20.00 (US)
	in 2004.

	Uranium Price Sensitivity Analysis 2005 to 2008
</B>
<BR>
<BR>
	The impact of the current higher spot prices and long-term price indicators will benefit Cameco in
	the longer term as the company delivers uranium in the future under new contracts signed in the
	current environment.
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="MARGIN-LEFT: 0%; TEXT-INDENT: 0%; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0%; FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	Of note, at the end of 2004, the average uranium spot price was $20.60 (US), while the long-term
	price indicator was $25.00 (US). Historically, long-term prices have generally been at a premium of
	$1.00 to $2.00 over prevailing spot prices. At the end of 2004, that difference was about $4.00
	(US)&nbsp;per pound. This spread is the consequence of the relatively low level of activity in the spot
	market over the last year or so, compared to the higher level of activity in the long-term market.
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="MARGIN-LEFT: 0%; TEXT-INDENT: 0%; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0%; FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	Current market fundamentals suggest that both spot and long-term prices should continue to
	strengthen, and we expect the spot price to move up somewhat more than the long-term price, so that
	the differential will move back to the more traditional spread of $1.00 to $2.00 (US).
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="MARGIN-LEFT: 0%; TEXT-INDENT: 0%; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0%; FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	Given the level of sales targeted each year (33&nbsp;million pounds in 2005), the company is continually
	in the market signing new contracts for deliveries that will begin two to three years hence. About
	25% to 30% of the current contract portfolio expires each year, and is replaced in large part with
	contracts that were entered into in the past two to three years.
<BR>
	During this period of increasing spot and long-term prices, the company has continued to enter into
	new multi-year contracts with improved terms. The new contract portfolio will reflect a mix of
	fixed and market-related prices. For the time being, Cameco continues to target its traditional
	blend of pricing mechanisms, that is, 40% of sales volume with fixed pricing and 60% sensitive to
	market pricing. Contracts with market-related pricing will reference the spot or long-term price
	indicators quoted near the time of delivery. These market-related contracts typically contain
	ceiling and floor prices. However, in recent months, we have been offering ceiling prices much
	higher than current spot prices, if at all. We have also been negotiating floor price protection,
	which has been in the range of current spot prices.
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="MARGIN-LEFT: 0%; TEXT-INDENT: 0%; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0%; FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	The fixed-price contracts will have prices that were fixed at the time of contract signing. This
	means the company has contracts at fixed prices below and above the current spot market prices and
	they fall into the category of &#147;insensitive&#148; to market price.
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="MARGIN-LEFT: 0%; TEXT-INDENT: 0%; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0%; FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	We believe this contract mix continues to be appropriate given our view that market prices will
	strengthen. At the same time, this contract mix allows us to lock in the significant differential
	between current spot and long-term prices, and provides firm support for our growth strategy.
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="MARGIN-LEFT: 0%; TEXT-INDENT: 0%; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0%; FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	The following table indicates the approximate percentage of targeted sales volume that will be
	impacted by further increases in the market price above $20.60 (US)&nbsp;per pound
	U
<SUB>
	3
</SUB>
	O
<SUB>
	8
</SUB>
	. As shown in the table below, the proportion of targeted sales that is
	sensitive to further increases in the market price grows significantly in 2006 and continues in
	2007 and 2008.

	In 2004, Cameco sold more than 32&nbsp;million pounds of uranium, representing a 9% decline from

	committed. Of these sales commitments, about 70% will be delivered during 2005 to 2007. Cameco&#146;s

	Cameco
	has applied for an increase in the annual licenced capacity at McArthur River and Key Lake to 22
	million pounds per year compared to 18.7&nbsp;million pounds currently. The CNSC has indicated that the
	application will require a screening level environmental assessment (EA)&nbsp;under the Canadian
	Environmental Assessment Act. We are hopeful for a decision from the CNSC late in 2005. If approval
	is received, Cameco expects it will take about two years to ramp up production. We are developing a
	plan to determine the optimal sustainable production rate, which may be less than the licensed
	capacity.

	Production at McArthur River/Key Lake in 2005 is expected to remain at the same level as 2004.

	On December&nbsp;21, 2004, after receiving a licence from the CNSC to construct a facility, the Cigar

	The ISL test mine at Inkai in Kazakhstan produced 0.47&nbsp;million pounds of uranium in 2004 (Cameco&#146;s
	share is 60%).
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="MARGIN-LEFT: 0%; TEXT-INDENT: 0%; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0%; FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	The Inkai Joint Venture has decided to proceed with construction of the Inkai ISL mine. The joint
	venture intends to submit an environmental assessment and a design plan for the commercial facility
	to Kazakh regulatory authorities in the first half of 2005, with approval expected by third quarter
	2005. Following approval, construction will begin with commercial production scheduled for late
	2007. The Inkai Joint Venture has notified the Kazakh government that it intends to increase
	production to 5.2&nbsp;million pounds per year at full capacity, up from the previous plan of 2.6
	million pounds. The costs, net of sales proceeds from Inkai&#146;s test production, are capitalized
	until commercial production is achieved. The test mine at Inkai is projected to produce 0.45
	million pounds of uranium in 2005.
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="MARGIN-LEFT: 0%; TEXT-INDENT: 0%; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0%; FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	The capital cost, excluding sales proceeds, to bring the new ISL mine to production is now
	estimated at $83&nbsp;million (US), up from the earlier estimate of $38&nbsp;million (US). The increase is
	due to the decision to double the plant production capacity and to increases in the costs of
	construction materials and plant equipment. Cameco has agreed to fund up to $40&nbsp;million (US)&nbsp;of
	development, which includes the original test mine, with an interest-bearing loan. The Inkai Joint
	Venture will fund the remainder. Repayment of the principal amount of the loan is expected to start
	once commercial production commences. The Inkai Joint Venture is obligated to repay the loan and
	interest. To the end of 2004, Cameco had advanced $28&nbsp;million (US).

	advanced exploration project, the Cree Extension project, has advanced the Millennium discovery,
	initially made in 2000, to an indicated and inferred resource. For more information on the

	Cameco and Pioneer Metals Corporation. Cameco has certain rights related to financing, milling, and
	marketing future uranium deposits discovered by UEX. Once Cameco&#146;s interest falls below 20%, these

	Purchases
<BR>

	Cameco also has purchase commitments for uranium products and services from various sources.
	At the end of 2004, these purchase commitments totalled 71&nbsp;million pounds uranium equivalent (most
	is in the form of UF
<SUB>
	6
</SUB>
	) from 2005 to 2013. Of this, 60&nbsp;million pounds is from exercising

	commercial agreement).

<B>
	Costs
<BR>
</B>
<BR>
	Cameco&#146;s cost of supply is influenced by its mix of produced mine material and uranium
	purchases.
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="MARGIN-LEFT: 0%; TEXT-INDENT: 0%; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0%; FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	Production costs at our Saskatchewan uranium mines, our largest source of production, are primarily
	fixed, with the largest component being labour. The largest variable operating cost is production
	supplies, followed by maintenance materials.
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="MARGIN-LEFT: 0%; TEXT-INDENT: 0%; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0%; FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	Uranium mine production costs are driven mostly by the complexity of the operation. Unit costs of
	production are driven primarily by the grade and size of the reserves. McArthur River is the
	world&#146;s largest, high-grade uranium mine. Its ore grade averages 25% U
<SUB>
	3
</SUB>
	O
<SUB>
	8
</SUB>
	which means it can produce more than 18&nbsp;million pounds per year by extracting only 100 to 120
	tonnes of ore per day. While Rabbit Lake&#146;s average ore grade of 1% U
<SUB>
	3
</SUB>
	O
<SUB>
	8
</SUB>
	is
	much lower, it compares favourably to other operating mines in the world that have ore grades
	generally below 0.5%.
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="MARGIN-LEFT: 0%; TEXT-INDENT: 0%; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0%; FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	ISL extraction methods can make even lower-grade orebodies commercially attractive. Worldwide, ISL
	mines typically recover uranium from orebodies with an average grade in the range of 0.1%
	U
<SUB>
	3
</SUB>
	O
<SUB>
	8
</SUB>
	. Cameco&#146;s cost of supply is influenced only modestly by the two US ISL
	operations, as the production from the ISL operations accounts for a small percentage of its total
	primary output. In 2005, US ISL production is expected to account for about 11% of the company&#146;s
	planned primary output.

	Purchased product also affects Cameco&#146;s cost of supply. The majority of Cameco&#146;s purchase

	The relationship between the Canadian and US dollars affects the financial results of the
	uranium business as well as the conversion business. For that reason, the effect on both businesses
	will be discussed in this section.
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="MARGIN-LEFT: 0%; TEXT-INDENT: 0%; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0%; FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	In 2004, the strengthening of the Canadian dollar against the US dollar affected Cameco&#146;s results.
	Cameco sells the majority of its uranium and conversion services in US dollars while most of its
	uranium and conversion services are produced in Canada. As such, the company&#146;s uranium and
	conversion services revenue is denominated mostly in US dollars, while its production costs are
	denominated primarily in Canadian dollars.
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="MARGIN-LEFT: 0%; TEXT-INDENT: 0%; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0%; FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	The company attempts to provide some protection against exchange rate fluctuations by planned
	hedging activity designed to smooth volatility. Therefore, Cameco&#146;s uranium and conversion revenues
	are partly sheltered against declines in the US dollar in the shorter term.
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="MARGIN-LEFT: 0%; TEXT-INDENT: 0%; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0%; FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	In addition, Cameco has a portion of its annual cash outlays denominated in US dollars, including
	uranium and conversion services purchases, which provide a natural hedge against US currency
	fluctuations. While natural hedges provide cash flow protection against exchange rate fluctuations,
	the influence on earnings from purchased material that has been inventoried may be dispersed over
	several fiscal periods and is more difficult to identify.
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="MARGIN-LEFT: 0%; TEXT-INDENT: 0%; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0%; FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	During 2004, the Canadian dollar strengthened against the US dollar from $1.2924 at December

	Cameco&#146;s uranium business consists of the McArthur River, Key Lake and Rabbit Lake mine/mill
	operations in Saskatchewan, two ISL mines in the US, the Inkai ISL test mine in Kazakhstan, the
	Cigar Lake development project in Saskatchewan and uranium exploration projects located primarily
	in Canada and Australia.

	Revenue
</B>
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	In 2004, Cameco established a new record for uranium revenue for the third consecutive year.
	Revenue from the uranium business increased by 2% to $581&nbsp;million from $570&nbsp;million in 2003, due to
	a 12% increase in the realized selling price reflected in Canadian dollars. This improvement was
	the result of an increase in the uranium spot price, which averaged $18.60 (US)&nbsp;in 2004 compared to
	$11.54 (US)&nbsp;in 2003. The benefit of the improved spot price was partially offset by contract price
	ceilings and a less favourable foreign exchange rate.
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	Also offsetting the price improvement was a deliberate reduction in sales volume to better reflect
	production and inventory levels. In 2004, uranium deliveries amounted to about 32&nbsp;million pounds,
	representing a 9% decline from last year&#146;s record quantity of 35&nbsp;million pounds.
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
<B>
	Cost of products and services sold
</B>
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	For 2004, the total cost of products and services sold was $378&nbsp;million compared to $394&nbsp;million in
	2003, reflecting the 9% decline in sales volume. On a per unit basis, the cost of product sold was
	about 5% higher than in the previous year. The cost of sales for 2003 included $24&nbsp;million in
	rehabilitation costs due to the mining difficulties at McArthur River. Excluding these costs and a
	$7&nbsp;million royalty recovery recorded in 2003, the unit cost of sale rose by 10% due to higher costs
	for purchased uranium and higher production costs at Rabbit Lake.

	In 2004, depreciation, depletion and reclamation (DD&#038;R) charges were $100&nbsp;million compared to $93
	million in 2003, due to a higher unit cost. On a per unit basis, costs rose by about 15% as the

	In 2004, gross profit from the uranium business amounted to $104&nbsp;million compared to $83&nbsp;million in
	2003, an increase of 25%. This was largely attributable to the higher spot price, which resulted in
	a 12% increase in the realized price and was partially offset by higher unit costs for uranium
	concentrates. Earnings before taxes from the uranium business increased by $21&nbsp;million in 2004 and
	the profit margin improved to 18% from 15% in 2003.

	In 2005, Cameco&#146;s uranium revenue is expected to be about 10% higher than in 2004 due to a
	projected 6% improvement in the Canadian dollar selling price and a 4% increase in deliveries.
	Uranium sales volume is expected to total more than 33&nbsp;million pounds in 2005. About 35% of
	uranium deliveries are expected to occur in the last quarter of the year. In 2005, Cameco&#146;s share

	Cameco is pursuing the opportunity provide a new fuel type to Bruce Power that will enhance
	its conversion supply capabilities. The Port Hope conversion facility currently supplies natural
	UO
<SUB>
	2
</SUB>
	powder for the manufacture of fuels for Candu reactors operating in Canada and other
	countries. The market for UO
<SUB>
	2
</SUB>
	is changing, at least partially, due to the planned
	introduction of slightly enriched uranium (SEU)&nbsp;in place of the natural uranium dioxide in some
	Candu reactors. SEU is a uranium dioxide powder that has an enrichment level up to 2.5% U-235, and
	is the primary uranium component of a new type of fuel that is proposed for use. The new fuel will
	increase the number of bundles as well as the concentration of U-235. This will result in an
	inherently safer design as the same amount of bundle power is distributed to more elements,
	reducing fuel element temperatures. The new design also incorporates a metal called dysprosium that
	will enhance the safety of the reactor by adding an additional braking feature. Commonly used in
	magnets and halogen lights, dysprosium has the ability to readily absorb neutrons and safely shut
	down a reactor.
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	Cameco&#146;s technology development group developed the process to produce SEU through blending,
	providing the company with an opportunity to participate in a changing market.

	Our initial plan is to produce SEU for Bruce Power&#146;s B reactors as part of a power uprate project
	that is expected to add about 400 megawatts to Ontario&#146;s electricity grid, an increase of almost 9%
	over current capacity.
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	In 2004, work continued toward regulatory approval of plans to produce SEU at Port Hope. The final
	environmental assessment (EA)&nbsp;study report was submitted for review in November to the CNSC and
	other agencies. The CNSC will gather the responses and prepare a draft screening report to be
	issued for public comment. The regulatory process was delayed by about six months by a peer review
	of the company&#146;s draft EA study report undertaken by the municipality of Port Hope in response to
	community concerns. The peer review conclusions generally supported the EA study report.
	Engineering work has continued on the detailed design of the SEU blending facility.
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	The total annual quantity of SEU produced will depend on future market development. The SEU product
	would replace a limited volume of the current natural UO

	product sales. Production of
	SEU at our Port Hope operation is subject to regulatory approval.

	Cameco believes it has the appropriate capabilities in place to maintain its low-cost status,
	protect and grow its market position and improve its supply flexibility. We need to remain

	market opportunities. Cameco is currently reviewing options to grow the conversion business to meet
	these longer-term opportunities.
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	As with our uranium business, we need to ensure we have adequate human resources to replace the

	In 2004, the cost of products and services sold was $102&nbsp;million compared to $92&nbsp;million in
	2003, an increase of 11% due to higher unit costs. In 2004, unit costs were adversely affected by a
	29% decline in production related to a labour dispute. Since it is Cameco&#146;s policy to account for
	its inventory on a weighted average basis, the unit cost of product sold tends to rise as
	production declines. On a per unit basis, the cost of products and services sold increased by about

	Revenue from the conversion business is likely to be marginally higher than in 2004 due to an
	expected 5% increase in the average realized selling price, partially offset by a forecast 4%
	reduction in deliveries. Conversion sales volume is expected to total about 16.2&nbsp;million kgU in
	2005 compared to 16.9&nbsp;million kgU in 2004. Production for 2005 is projected to be about 13.5
	million kgU, up from 9.5&nbsp;million kgU in 2004. As a result, unit costs are expected to be lower than
	in 2004, improving the profit margin.

<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	In addition to the carrying value of its investment in Bruce Power, Cameco has provided certain
	financial assurances on behalf of the partnership. Cameco&#146;s maximum exposure under these

<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	On December&nbsp;9, 2004, the Ontario government passed legislation that will restructure the
	electricity sector to address the widening gap between supply and demand in the province. Bill 100
	details a range of measures intended to encourage private investment, expand market participation,
	maintain price stability and construct or conserve 25,000 MW of capacity by 2020.
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	The government has established the Ontario Power Authority to ensure adequate supply, and to
	promote new supply through requests for proposals or other negotiations.
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	The bill includes a requirement that the Independent Electricity System Operator (previously the
	Independent Electricity Market Operator) ensures that power users pay the true cost of electricity,
	taking into consideration the mix of regulated and market prices paid to generators. Cameco expects
	the legislation will bring much needed clarity and stability to Ontario&#146;s electricity sector.

	Bruce Power earnings are significantly affected by fluctuations in electricity spot market prices,
	which in turn are affected by supply (temporary generating station shutdowns) and demand (mainly
	driven by weather).
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	To reduce its exposure to fluctuations in spot market prices, Bruce Power has a portfolio of
	fixed-price sales contracts. Bruce Power&#146;s proportion of output being sold under fixed price
	contracts will continue to decrease in 2005. For 2005, 36% of Bruce Power&#146;s planned output is
	expected to be sold under fixed-price contracts. This compares with 48% in 2004 and 65% in 2003.
	The major reason is the uncertainty in Ontario&#146;s electricity market, as buyers and sellers have
	adopted a &#147;wait and see&#148; attitude to forward contracting until the market structure is stronger.

	95% of Bruce Power&#146;s costs are fixed, volume improvements are directly reflected in financial

	At the same time, Bruce Power&#146;s ongoing emphasis on safety was reflected in its accident frequency

	Cameco intends to build in-house expertise in reactor operations and electricity marketing. We seek

	Earnings
</B>
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	In 2004, Bruce Power earnings before taxes were $338&nbsp;million compared to $286&nbsp;million in 2003.
	The increase can be attributed to higher electricity generation in 2004 compared to 2003.
	Cameco&#146;s pre-tax earnings from Bruce Power in 2004 amounted to $121&nbsp;million compared to $108
	million in 2003.
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
<B>
	Revenue
</B>
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	In 2004, revenue totalled $1,583&nbsp;million, up 31% from 2003. Bruce Power&#146;s realized price averaged
	$47 per MWh from a mix of contract and spot sales, a 2% decrease over the same period last year.
	The Ontario electricity spot price averaged about $50 per MWh during 2004 compared to $54 per MWh a
	year earlier. During 2004, about 48% of Bruce Power&#146;s output was sold under fixed-price contracts
	compared to 65% in 2003.
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	The Bruce Power units achieved a total capacity factor of 82% in 2004, down from 85% in 2003.
	Bruce Power produced 33.6 TWh in 2004, an increase of 37% over the previous year, reflecting the
	addition of the two A units, as well as the 3% increase in reactor power at unit B6, which was
	achieved through fuel reconfiguration.
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
<B>
	Costs
</B>
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	In 2004, operating costs (including depreciation and amortization) totalled $1,178&nbsp;million, 38%
	higher than in 2003. This was primarily as a result of operating six units rather than four and
	the resulting increase in staff and material costs.
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	Cash operating costs were impacted by outage expenses incurred during 2004 and included $16&nbsp;million
	for the technical feasibility study of restarting units A1 and A2. In 2004, depreciation and
	amortization expense was up 81% compared to 2003 due primarily to the amortization of capital costs
	related to the restart of units A3 and A4.
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	About 95% of Bruce Power&#146;s operating costs are fixed. As such, most of the costs are incurred
	whether the plant is operating or not. On a per unit basis, the 2004 operating cost was $35 per
	MWh, similar to 2003.

	Cash from Operations
</B>
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	For 2004, Bruce Power generated $439&nbsp;million in cash from operations compared to $387&nbsp;million in
	2003 due to increased generation. All of Bruce Power&#146;s cash flow has been reinvested in its
	plants.
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
<B>
	Capital Expenditures
</B>
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	In 2004, capital expenditures were $359&nbsp;million compared to $528&nbsp;million in 2003 when programs to
	restart units A3 and A4 were under way. The $359&nbsp;million expenditure in 2004 was less than the
	expected $400&nbsp;million due to a reorganization of planned outages, some savings and a deferral of
	about $15&nbsp;million into 2005.
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	For 2004, Bruce Power&#146;s operating cash flows, along with cash on hand, allowed for the
	repayment of $110&nbsp;million of short-term debt.
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
<B>
	Outlook for 2005
</B>
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	Bruce Power&#146;s results in 2005 are anticipated to decline modestly from 2004 due to increased
	costs related to higher depreciation and amortization on the A units, higher outage costs and
	higher fuel costs. Results, however, are sensitive to the Ontario electricity price, where the
	market structure is under review, and the operating performance of the Bruce Power units.
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
<B>
	2005 Planned Outages
</B>
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	Refurbishment of existing unit critical components is planned in 2005 as part of the maintenance
	program outlined below. Capacity factors for the year are expected to average about 85%. For 2006,
	a significant reduction in time and expenditure on refurbishment programs for the six reactors
	currently operating is anticipated. This excludes any potential refurbishment efforts for units A1
	and A2. The long-term goal is to reach a capacity factor of 90%.

	Cameco expects that funding of these projects will come entirely from Bruce Power cash flows.
	However, available funds will depend on the electricity market prices and the operational
	performance of the Bruce Power reactors.
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	At this level of planned capital expenditures, and excluding any new capital expenditures for
	growth initiatives such as the restart of units A1 and A2, cash distributions from Bruce Power are
	possible in 2005. The partnership will determine whether to take cash distributions or reinvest in
	Bruce Power or other growth initiatives. Any cash distributions will depend on the Ontario
	electricity market prices and the operating performance of Bruce Power.

	Electricity Price Sensitivity Analysis
</B>
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	For 2005, about 36% of Bruce Power&#146;s planned output will be under fixed-price contracts. A $1.00
	per MWh change in the spot price for electricity in Ontario would change Cameco&#146;s after-tax
	earnings from Bruce Power by about $5&nbsp;million.

	Gold Financial Results
</B>
<BR>
<BR>
	In 2004, revenue from the gold business increased to $323&nbsp;million from $114&nbsp;million in 2003,
	reflecting the full consolidation of Kumtor&#146;s results since June&nbsp;2004 as well as production from
	the Boroo mine. A higher realized price for gold also added to revenue, increasing to $397 (US)&nbsp;in
	2004 compared to $334 (US)&nbsp;in 2003. This was due to a reduced hedge level, which provided greater
	exposure to the higher spot price. The Canadian dollar revenue does not reflect this entire
	increase due to the strength of the Canadian dollar relative to 2003.
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	Production at the Kumtor mine decreased by 20,224 ounces in 2004 due to a lower ore grade that
	averaged 4.4 g/t compared to 4.5 g/t in 2003. Kumtor&#146;s total cash cost per ounce increased slightly
	to $202 (US)&nbsp;compared to $191 (US)&nbsp;in 2003 due to the decrease in production.
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	Production at Boroo totalled 217,998 ounces since commercial production was declared on March&nbsp;1,
	2004. Boroo&#146;s total cash cost per ounce was $149 (US)&nbsp;for the 10-month post-commercialization
	period.
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	The gross profit margin for gold declined marginally to 34% in 2004 compared to 35% in 2003.
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
<B>
	Gold Outlook for 2005
</B>
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	Based on Centerra&#146;s current operations, total production for the year is forecast at 762,000
	ounces, a decline of almost 16% from 2004, primarily as a result of lower ore grades at the
	Kumtor mine. However, Centerra&#146;s share of production is expected to increase to 750,000 ounces
	from 610,287 in 2004 due to the increased ownership level in both mines and a full year of
	operation at Boroo.
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	At Kumtor, production in 2005 is expected to decline to 512,000 ounces from 657,329 ounces in
	2004, due to a lower ore grade averaging 3.5 grams per tonne (g/t) compared to 4.4 g/t in 2004.
	Total cash costs at Kumtor are expected to be higher at $255 (US)&nbsp;per ounce due to the reduced
	production. As a result, profits are expected to be lower than in 2004. For Boroo, 2005

	production is expected to be similar to 2004, at about 250,000 ounces. Total cash cost is
	forecast to be $179 (US)&nbsp;per ounce.
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	Overall, gold earnings are expected to decline in 2005 from 2004 due to higher costs as a
	result of lower grades at Kumtor.
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	In January&nbsp;2005, Centerra announced new reserve and resources estimates for its properties.
	Based on these estimates, Centerra has reported that the mine life at both Kumtor and Boroo
	would be extended by one year. Cameco&#146;s annual information form
	for 2004 includes these new reserve and resource estimates.

<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	For 2005, gold sales are unhedged. A $10.00 (US)&nbsp;per ounce change in the gold spot price would
	change Cameco revenue by about $10&nbsp;million (Cdn), cash flow by about $9&nbsp;million (Cdn) and net
	earnings by about $4&nbsp;million (Cdn).

	Consolidated revenue rose 33% to $361&nbsp;million in the fourth quarter of 2004, while net
	earnings increased 9% to $37&nbsp;million or $0.21 per share. The improvement in fourth quarter net
	earnings was primarily due to higher realized prices in the uranium and gold businesses as well as
	significantly higher gold production.
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	These improvements were partially offset by reduced earnings in the conversion business and higher
	charges for administration, exploration and interest. Administration costs increased by $5&nbsp;million
	due to higher expenses associated with operating Centerra Gold Inc. as a separate publicly traded
	company and increased stock compensation expenses.
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	Exploration expenses rose by $7&nbsp;million reflecting the increased activity in the uranium and gold
	businesses. Interest and other costs were up $3&nbsp;million as they included $7&nbsp;million in deferred
	issue costs related to the redemption of Cameco&#146;s 8.75% preferred securities in the quarter. The
	impact of this expense was partially offset by higher interest income earned on cash balances
	held by Centerra.

	The effective tax rate decreased to 10% in the fourth quarter of 2004, compared to 41% in the
	same period of 2003 due to a higher proportion of earnings coming from lower tax jurisdictions. The
	tax rate for the fourth quarter of 2003 reflected the impact of a change in Ontario tax

	Net earnings do not trend with revenue and varied significantly from quarter to quarter
	for two main reasons. First, Cameco&#146;s earnings are significantly influenced by results from
	Bruce Power. The equity method of accounting is applied to the investment in Bruce Power
	and therefore no revenue is recorded. Second, the net earnings in the second quarter of
	2004 reflect a net gain of $89&nbsp;million as a result of the Centerra restructuring

	Centerra
	restructuring transactions and the results for 2003 included an $81&nbsp;million tax adjustment as a
	result of changes in Canadian federal and Ontario provincial tax legislation.
	Excluding these items, Cameco recorded adjusted net earnings of $185&nbsp;million ($1.08 per share)
	compared to $127&nbsp;million ($0.75 per share) recorded in 2003. This $58&nbsp;million increase was
	attributable to improved results in the uranium and gold businesses as well as stronger
	performance at Bruce Power, partially offset by higher charges for administration and
	exploration.
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	The improvement in the uranium business was due to a higher realized price, which was related
	mainly to the significant increase in the spot price for uranium. Earnings from Bruce Power
	benefited from a 37% increase in generation as a result of the restart of two A reactors (units 3
	and 4). Results from the gold business improved due to increased production and a higher realized
	selling price.
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	Excluding the tax adjustment in 2003, the effective rate for income taxes in 2004 decreased to
	19% from 33% as a higher proportion of earnings came from lower tax jurisdictions. Earnings from
	operations were $125&nbsp;million compared to $75&nbsp;million in 2003 and the aggregate gross profit
	margin increased to 23% from 20% in 2003.

<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	In 2004, administration costs were $70&nbsp;million, an increase of $22&nbsp;million due to a combination
	of higher costs related to establishing and operating Centerra ($9&nbsp;million), increased stock
	compensation expenses ($5&nbsp;million) and higher expenditures for regulatory compliance. In 2004,
	Cameco and its subsidiaries incurred costs of $2&nbsp;million related to Sarbanes-Oxley compliance. In
	addition, there were increased costs associated with growth and quality initiatives.
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	Effective January&nbsp;1, 2003, Cameco changed its accounting policy for stock-based compensation opting
	to record compensation expense at the fair value of the options granted. The total expense is
	amortized over the vesting period of the options. For 2004, stock option expenses amounted to $7.2

<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	In 2004, interest and other costs declined by $2&nbsp;million compared to 2003 due to reduced foreign
	exchange losses ($3&nbsp;million) and to gains related to the ineffective portion of derivative hedging
	instruments ($7&nbsp;million). These improvements were partially offset by expenses recorded in
	connection with the redemption of the 8.75% preferred securities in 2004. As a result of the
	redemption, Cameco expensed $7&nbsp;million in deferred issue costs, which were previously being
	amortized over the 49-year life of the preferred securities. See note 11 of the consolidated

	Excluding the effects of the changes in legislation, income tax expense for 2004 was $13&nbsp;million

	In 2004, Cameco generated cash from operations of $228&nbsp;million compared to $250&nbsp;million in 2003.
	This decrease of $22&nbsp;million was primarily due to an increase in inventory levels, which more than
	offset the benefit of higher revenue.
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	Cameco&#146;s cash from operations does not include its pro rata interest in Bruce Power&#146;s operating
	cash flow. The pro rata share was $139&nbsp;million in 2004 compared to $117&nbsp;million in 2003. Cameco
	accounts for this investment using the equity method and thus Bruce Power&#146;s operating cash flows
	are not consolidated with Cameco&#146;s. For further information, refer to note 16 (c)&nbsp;of the
	consolidated financial statements.

	Investing Activities

	Cash used in investing activities decreased to $161&nbsp;million from $463&nbsp;million in 2003. This
	decline of $302&nbsp;million was largely attributable to the $279&nbsp;million investment in Bruce Power in
	2003. In addition, expenditures in 2003 reflected the development of the Boroo mine. For 2004,
	investing activities included $34&nbsp;million for sustaining capital at McArthur River/Key Lake, $28
	million in development costs at Cigar Lake and $25&nbsp;million in capitalized interest charges. The
	restructuring of the gold business required a net cash outlay of $4&nbsp;million.

	Financing Activities

<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	In 2004, cash provided by operations exceeded cash used in investing activities by $67&nbsp;million,
	allowing the company to repay $54&nbsp;million of its long-term debt during the year. The initial public offering of common
	shares in Centerra generated $101&nbsp;million after underwriters&#146; fees. See note 20(a) of the

	At the end of 2004, total product inventories amounted to $387&nbsp;million, $71&nbsp;million or 22% higher
	than the previous year end. Of this increase, about $30&nbsp;million was related to higher uranium
	inventory levels and about $25&nbsp;million was due to an increase in unit costs for uranium. The
	remainder was related to higher gold inventory levels. See note 3 to the consolidated financial

	Effective January&nbsp;1, 2004, Cameco changed its accounting policy for financial instruments. This
	change resulted in the preferred securities and convertible debentures being classified as debt
	rather than equity. See note 2(b) to the consolidated financial statements.
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	On December&nbsp;17, 2004, Cameco redeemed its 8.75% preferred securities, due September&nbsp;30, 2047, in
	the principal amount of $125&nbsp;million (US). The redemption of the principal amount plus accrued and
	unpaid interest was funded with lower-cost commercial paper.

	At December&nbsp;31, 2004, total long-term debt was $519&nbsp;million, a decrease of $87&nbsp;million

	CONSOLIDATED OUTLOOK FOR 2005
</I>
</B>
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	In 2005, consolidated revenue is expected to grow by about 10% over 2004 due to increases in
	the uranium and gold businesses. On a consolidated basis, the gross profit margin is projected to
	improve from the 23% reported in 2004.
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	In the uranium business, revenue is likely to be significantly higher due to a stronger realized
	price and increased volumes. Revenue from the conversion business is likely to be marginally
	higher than in 2004 due to an expected 5% increase in the average realized selling price, largely
	offset by lower deliveries.
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	Bruce Power results in 2005 are anticipated to decline modestly from 2004 due to increased costs
	related to higher depreciation and amortization on the A units, higher outage costs and higher fuel
	costs.
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	Revenue in the gold business is expected to be higher due primarily to a full year of
	consolidating the results from Kumtor, a wholly owned subsidiary of Centerra. However, gold
	results are anticipated to decline in 2005 from 2004 due to higher costs as a result of expected
	lower grades at Kumtor.
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	In 2005, total capital expenditures are expected to more than double to $300&nbsp;million. Capital
	expenditures are classified as growth or sustaining. Growth capital is defined to be capital
	spent to bring on incremental production. Everything else is sustaining capital. Cameco expects
	it will have sufficient debt capacity and cash from operations to fund our capital expenditure
	program.

	Cameco buys a significant amount of goods and services for its Saskatchewan mining operations
	from northern Saskatchewan suppliers to support economic development in the region. One such
	supplier is Kitsaki Management Limited Partnership. Harry Cook, a director of Cameco, was the chair
	of this company and was also the Chief of Lac LaRonge Indian Band, which owns Kitsaki. In 2004,
	Cameco had paid Kitsaki subsidiary companies $23&nbsp;million for transportation and catering services.
	Chief Cook has retired as Chief of the Lac LaRonge Indian Band as of March&nbsp;31, 2005.

	In addition to disclosing results in accordance with Canadian generally accepted accounting
	principles (GAAP), Cameco also provides supplementary non-GAAP measures as a method to evaluate
	the company&#146;s operating performance.

	Adjusted Net Earnings
</B>
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	The measure &#147;adjusted net earnings&#148; for 2004 excludes the earnings impact of the
	transactions related to the Centerra restructuring. The restructuring allowed Cameco to
	recognize an increase to net earnings of $94&nbsp;million ($0.55 per share).
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	The measure for 2003 excludes the effect of changes in Canadian federal and Ontario provincial
	tax laws. Together, the changes in the tax legislation allowed Cameco to recognize a reduction in
	deferred income taxes of $81&nbsp;million ($0.48 per share).
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	Cameco believes the exclusion of these items provides a more meaningful basis for
	period-to-period comparisons of the company&#146;s financial results.

<B>
	Total Cash Cost
</B>
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	This MD&#038;A presents information about total cash cost of production of an ounce of gold for the
	operating properties of Centerra. Except as otherwise noted, total cash cost per ounce is
	calculated by dividing total cash costs, as determined using the industry standard published by the
	Gold Institute, by gold ounces produced for the relevant period. The Gold Institute is a nonprofit
	international association of miners, refiners, bullion suppliers and manufacturers of gold
	products, which has developed a standard format for reporting costs on a per ounce basis.
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	Total cash costs, as defined in the Gold Institute standard, include mine operating costs such as
	mining, processing, administration, royalties and production taxes, but exclude amortization,
	reclamation costs, financing costs and capital, development and exploration.
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	Total cash cost per ounce has been included because certain investors use this information to
	assess performance of Cameco&#146;s gold segment. The inclusion of total cash cost per ounce enables
	investors to better understand year-on-year changes in production costs, which in turn affect
	profitability and cash flow.

	CHANGES IN ACCOUNTING POLICIES
</I>
</B>
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	Effective January&nbsp;1, 2004, Cameco adopted two new accounting policies. The first change was
	related to accounting for financial instruments and the second was related to hedging
	relationships. See note 2(b) of the consolidated financial statements.
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	Effective January&nbsp;1, 2004, Cameco adopted the amendments to CICA Handbook Section&nbsp;3860, Financial
	Instruments. This change in accounting policy was applied retroactively and, accordingly, the
	consolidated financial statements of prior years were restated. The main result of this change was
	to classify Cameco&#146;s convertible debentures and preferred securities as debt whereas they had been
	reflected as equity in the past. The amendments to this section were required by the CICA to be
	implemented for the 2005 fiscal year. However, Cameco chose to adopt the amendments early because
	it believed the result was a fairer representation of the nature of its financial instruments.
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	Effective January&nbsp;1, 2004, Cameco adopted the new Canadian Accounting Guideline, Hedging
	Relationships, which establish new criteria for hedging relationships in effect on or after January
	1, 2004. The adoption of this accounting guideline was mandated by the CICA.

	RISK MANAGEMENT
</I>
</B>
<P>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	Cameco has developed and implemented a systematic process to qualitatively identify and report
	risks of corporate significance to senior management. The enterprise risk management (ERM)&nbsp;process
	requires corporate risk owners to periodically review the significant risks in their areas of
	responsibility and report on the effectiveness of the controls in place. This information is
	maintained in a corporate risk register, which is updated at least annually, or as new risks are
	identified. Regular reports on the ERM program status are made to management, and the risk register
	is used to inform the corporate audit programs. Management periodically identifies risks that
	require a more detailed examination of their controls. A discussion of Cameco&#146;s areas of potential
	risk follows.

	Financial Risk
</B>
<P>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	Cameco&#146;s financial condition is influenced by operational performance and by a number of
	market risks. The most significant of these risks are fluctuations in market prices and sales
	volumes of uranium, conversion, gold and electricity, foreign exchange rates and unit costs of
	production. Risk management strategies are employed to assist in identifying and mitigating these
	and other risks.
</DIV>
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
<B>
	Uranium Prices
</B>
<P>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	Because the majority of the company&#146;s revenues are derived from the sale of uranium and
	uranium products, the company&#146;s net earnings and operating cash flows are closely related and
	sensitive to fluctuations in the long-and-short term market price of U
<SUB>
	3
</SUB>
	O
<SUB>
	8
</SUB>
	and
	for uranium conversion services. Historically, these prices have fluctuated and have been and will
	continue to be affected by numerous factors beyond the company&#146;s control. Such factors include,
	among others: demand for nuclear power; political and economic conditions in uranium producing and
	consuming countries, such as Canada, the US and Russia and other republics of the Commonwealth of Independent States; reprocessing
	of used reactor fuel and the re-enrichment of depleted uranium tails; sales of excess civilian and
	military inventories (including from the dismantling of nuclear weapons) by governments and
	industry participants; and production levels and costs of production in countries such as Russia
	and other republics of the CIS, Africa and Australia.
</DIV>
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	The company reduces its exposure to short-term volatility in uranium prices by maintaining a
	long-term contract portfolio that is diversified by price mechanism, delivery date and customer.
	About 60% of Cameco&#146;s contract portfolio has been priced in relation to the spot or long-term price
	indicators in effect at or near the time of delivery. The remaining 40% has been sold at a fixed
	price (usually adjusted for inflation) over the term of the contract. The company&#146;s sensitivity to
	changes in the uranium spot price is noted in the section entitled &#147;Uranium Price Sensitivity
	Analysis 2005 to 2008&#148; in this MD&#038;A.
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	Although Cameco employs various pricing mechanisms within its sales contracts to manage its
	exposure to price fluctuations, there can be no assurance that such a program will be successful.
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
<B>
	Limited Number of Customers
</B>
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	Cameco relies on a small number of customers that purchase a significant portion of the
	company&#146;s uranium concentrates and conversion services. For example, Cameco&#146;s five largest
	customers are expected to account for 41% of the company&#146;s contracted supply of
	U
<SUB>
	3
</SUB>
	O
<SUB>
	8
</SUB>
	for 2005 through 2007. This compares to 42% of the contracted supply of

</SUB>
	O
<SUB>
	8
</SUB>
	for 2004 through 2006.

	For the period 2005 through 2007, Cameco&#146;s five largest UF

	6
</SUB>
	conversion customers are
	anticipated to account for approximately 37% of the company&#146;s contracted supply of UF

	conversion services. Cameco is currently the only commercial supplier of UO

<B>
	Use of Derivatives
</B>
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	Cameco may use financial derivatives to assist in mitigating its exposure to fluctuations in
	gold price and foreign exchange rates. A derivative is entered into as a hedge against specific
	economic and transactional exposures. Cameco does not enter into derivative contracts for
	speculative purposes. However, derivatives bring with them an exposure to counterparty
	default.
<SUP STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 85%; VERTICAL-ALIGN: TEXT-TOP">
	1
</SUP>
	As of December&nbsp;31, 2004, Cameco&#146;s exposure is predominantly with
	counterparties that had credit ratings of A&#043; or higher. Accordingly, Cameco believes the risks of
	default are low and the benefits derived from using derivatives outweigh the risks.
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	Although the company seeks to manage its credit risk exposure in connection with financial
	derivatives, there can be no assurance that the company will be successful.
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
<B>
	Foreign Exchange Risk
</B>
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	The US/Canadian foreign exchange rate at December&nbsp;31, 2003 was $1.2924 and averaged $1.3015
	during 2004. Most of the company&#146;s revenues are in US dollars with a majority of its costs in
	Canadian dollars. To reduce its currency risk, at December&nbsp;31, 2004, Cameco had sold forward $748
	million (US). These hedges are expected to yield an average exchange rate of $1.3010. The
	mark-to-market gain on these positions was $68&nbsp;million (Cdn) at December&nbsp;31, 2004 based on a
	year-end exchange rate of $1.2036.
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	Timing differences between the usage and designation of hedge contracts may result in deferred
	revenue or deferred charges. At the end of 2004, deferred revenue to be recognized in future years
	totalled $23&nbsp;million.
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	Although Cameco utilizes a hedging program to manage its exchange rate exposure, there can be no
	assurance that such a program will be successful.
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
<B>
	Political Risk
</B>
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	The company has diversified its political risk internationally. The Kumtor gold mine is
	located in the Kyrgyz Republic, a country formerly part of the Soviet Union. The mine is the
	largest foreign investment in the country and represented about 7% of the country&#146;s gross domestic
	product, 44% of export earnings and 40% of total industrial production in 2003, the latest date for
	which information is available. The importance of Kumtor in relation to the rest of the Kyrgyz
	economy has meant that Kumtor has maintained a very high profile within the country. This level of
	attention is not without risk; however, it has also been of benefit in ensuring continued efficient
	operations.

	Counterparty default would occur if the other
	party in a derivative contract is unable to perform its obligations at the time
	of contract maturity, resulting in the intended hedge being of no value. This
	concern is addressed by dealing with a variety of counterparties and primarily
	only those of high credit quality and limiting the amount and duration of the
	exposure. A measure of default risk is the mark-to-market value of a hedge
	position. This value is the difference between the price at which a derivative
	contract was entered into and its current market value. A mark-to-market gain
	indicates that the company has that amount of value at risk should its
	counterparties default. A mark-to-market loss represents the amount of value
	Cameco would have to pay should the hedge position need to be settled
	immediately.

	Cameco also owns a 60% interest in Joint Venture Inkai (JVI), which is developing a uranium mine in
	the Republic of Kazakhstan. Through KazAtomProm, the Republic of Kazakhstan owns the remaining 40%
	of JVI. Cameco has agreed to provide funding of up to $40&nbsp;million (US)&nbsp;to JVI for project
	development of which $28&nbsp;million (US)&nbsp;has been funded to the end of 2004. Test mining continued
	through 2004. The feasibility study was approved in 2005. To date, the Kazakhstan government has
	supported the project, but there is no assurance that support will continue for the project&#146;s
	duration.
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	Cameco also owns a 52.7% interest in Centerra, which owns 95% of the Boroo gold project in
	Mongolia. At Boroo, commercial production was achieved on March&nbsp;1, 2004. The investment in Boroo
	may be exposed to adverse political developments that could affect the economics of the project.
	The Mongolian government has supported the project to date, but there is no assurance that support
	will continue for the project&#146;s duration.
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	Cameco&#146;s investment in these operations may be exposed to adverse political developments that could
	affect the economics of each operation. The company has made an assessment of the political risk
	associated with each of its foreign investments and has purchased political risk insurance to
	mitigate losses as deemed appropriate.
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	There can be no assurance that political risk insurance would continue to be available at any time
	or that particular losses Cameco may suffer with respect to its foreign investments will be covered
	by the insurance. These losses could have an adverse impact on Cameco&#146;s future cash flows,
	earnings, results of operations and financial condition if not adequately covered by insurance.
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
<B>
	Insurance
</B>
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	Cameco purchases insurance to mitigate losses that may arise from certain liability and
	property risks. The cost of this insurance and the specific protection provided by the policies
	vary from year to year depending on conditions in the insurance market. Although general insurance
	market conditions continued to be difficult in 2004, renewed interest from underwriters in the
	mining sector resulted in the availability of more capacity at improved premiums.
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	Cameco believes that the insurance program it has in place continues to prudently address its major
	liability and property risk exposures.
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	Higher levels of uncertainty in the insurance market are expected to continue for at least a few
	more years. During this time, the availability of certain types of insurance coverage that Cameco
	has purchased in the past may be significantly reduced and/or the cost to acquire insurance may
	significantly increase.
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	Although Cameco maintains insurance to cover some of these risks and hazards in amounts Cameco
	believes to be reasonable, this insurance may not provide adequate coverage in all circumstances.
	No assurance can be given that Cameco&#146;s insurance will continue to be available at economically
	feasible premiums or that it will provide sufficient coverage for losses related to these or other
	risks and hazards.
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">

<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	Cameco&#146;s business is capital intensive and subject to a number of risks and hazards, including
	environmental pollution, accidents or spills, industrial and transportation accidents, catastrophic
	accidents, labour disputes, blockades or other acts of social activism, changes in the regulatory
	environment, natural phenomena (such as inclement weather conditions, earthquakes, pit wall
	failures, ground movements, tailings pipeline and dam failures, cave-ins, adverse mining conditions
	and underground flooding) and encountering unusual or unexpected geological conditions. Due to the
	unique nature of the deposits at McArthur River and Cigar Lake, technical challenges exist
	involving groundwater, rock properties, mining methods, radiation protection and ore handling and
	transport. The company also contracts for the transport of its uranium and uranium products to
	refining, conversion and enrichment facilities in North America and Europe, which exposes the
	company to transportation risks. Many of the foregoing risks and hazards could result in damage to,
	or destruction of, the company&#146;s mineral properties or refining or conversion facilities, personal
	injury or death, environmental damage, delays in or interruption of or cessation of production from
	the company&#146;s mines or refining or conversion facilities or in its exploration or development
	activities, delay in or inability to receive regulatory approvals to transport its uranium and
	uranium products, or costs, monetary losses and potential legal liability and adverse governmental
	action. In addition, due to the radioactive nature of the materials handled in uranium mining,
	refining, conversion and transport, additional costs and risks are incurred by the company on a
	regular and ongoing basis.
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
<B>
	Safety, Health and Environmental Risk
</B>
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	Cameco is subject not only to the normal worker health, safety and environmental risks
	associated with all mining and chemical processing, but also to additional risks uniquely
	associated with uranium mining, milling and conversion operations.
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	In 2001, to better manage these risks and to enhance its quality culture, Cameco embarked upon the
	design and implementation of an integrated quality management system (QMS). Program development
	continued in 2003. The QMS was implemented at Cameco&#146;s Canadian uranium sites to a degree that
	meets the CNSC requirements by the end of 2004. The complete QMS implementation at Canadian uranium
	operating sites and related head office requirements is scheduled to be finalized by the end of
	2005. Cameco also continues to utilize an environmental management system at its operations. The
	company received its initial ISO 14001 certification at its Port Hope conversion facility in 2000,
	which in turn received its re-certification in 2003. The Blind River refinery was first certified
	in 2002 and successfully re-certified in January&nbsp;2005. Certification was received at both the
	McArthur River mine and the Key Lake milling operation in 2003. Both of these sites are scheduled
	for re-certification in 2005.
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	Also in conjunction with the QMS program, Cameco is reviewing its existing health and safety
	management system, based upon principles similar to those in the ISO series of management systems
	and identifying ways to further implement it and integrate it with QMS. Work is under way to
	integrate the health and safety, environmental, and quality management systems into one integrated
	system at the corporate level in 2005. For 2004, on a combined basis, Cameco, its

	Regulators must approve the startup, continued operation and decommissioning of many of Cameco&#146;s
	facilities. These facilities are subject to numerous laws and regulations regarding safety and
	environmental matters and the management of hazardous wastes and materials.
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	Significant economic value is dependent on the company&#146;s ability to obtain and renew licences
	necessary to operate. The Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission (CNSC)&nbsp;approved renewal of the
	operating licences for Key Lake and McArthur River on October&nbsp;25, 2004 and they are valid until
	October&nbsp;31, 2008.
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	Cameco continues to face challenges from the burden of increasing regulatory demands and costs from
	the CNSC, Canadian Environmental Assessment Agency, and other federal and provincial regulators. In
	particular, the lead regulator, CNSC, is increasing the regulatory burden as a result of the
	implementation of the Canadian Nuclear Safety and Control Act. In addition the CNSC and Environment
	Canada are calling for more stringent environmental monitoring and environmental performance, based
	on precautionary principles, of uranium mining and milling operations.
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	Operational changes are increasingly subject to regulatory approval that may include delays due to
	longer and more complex regulatory review and approval processes. These increasing requirements are
	expected to continue to result in higher administration costs and capital expenditures for
	compliance. The increasing complexity of the regulatory approval process reduces the flexibility of
	the company to make operational changes in a timely fashion.
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	Cameco expends significant financial and managerial resources to comply with a complex set of
	environmental, health and safety laws, regulations, guidelines and permitting requirements (for the
	purpose of this paragraph, &#147;laws&#148;) drawn from a number of jurisdictions. The historical trend
	toward stricter environmental laws is likely to continue. The possibility of more stringent laws or
	more rigorous enforcement of existing laws exists in the areas of worker health and safety, the
	disposition of wastes, the decommissioning and reclamation of mining sites and other environmental
	matters, each of which could have a material adverse effect on Cameco&#146;s exploration, operations or
	the cost or the viability of a particular project.
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	Cameco&#146;s facilities operate under various operating and environmental permits, licences and
	approvals that contain conditions that must be met and Cameco&#146;s right to continue operating
	Cameco&#146;s facilities is, in a number of instances, dependent upon compliance with these conditions.
	Failure to meet certain of these conditions could result in interruption or closure of exploration,
	development, mining operations or refinery and conversion operations or material fines or
	penalties, all of which could have an adverse impact on Cameco&#146;s future cash flows, earnings,
	results of operations and financial condition.

	Reclamation and Decommissioning

<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">

	and reclamation costs, based on current operations to date, for its operating assets. At the end of
	2004, the estimate was $237&nbsp;million. The majority of such expenditures are typically incurred at
	the end of the useful lives of the operations to which they relate and, therefore, only a very
	small percentage of total estimated costs is expected to be incurred over the next five years. See
	note 7 to the consolidated financial statements.
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	At the end of 2004, Cameco&#146;s accounting provision for future reclamation costs totalled $167
	million. To provide financial assurances for these costs, Cameco has provided letters of credit
	(LOCs), where required. Cameco&#146;s LOCs totalled $204&nbsp;million at the end of 2004, of which $164
	million was related to reclamation and decommissioning activities.
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	Since mid-2001, all Cameco&#146;s North American operations have in place letters of credit providing
	financial assurance, which are aligned with preliminary plans for site-wide decommissioning.
	Beginning in 1996, the company has conducted regulatory-required reviews of its decommissioning
	plans for all Canadian sites. These periodic reviews are done on a five-year basis, or at the time
	of an amendment to an operating licence, or if at renewal, there has been a material change to the
	site. Reclamation and decommissioning obligations represent unfunded liabilities of the company.

<B>
	Electricity Business Risks
</B>
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	Through its interest in Bruce Power, Cameco is exposed to various business risks associated
	with the generation and marketing of electricity. The following discusses some, but not all, risks
	associated with this business.
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	In Ontario, political risk results from uncertainty over the future direction of government energy
	policies. This risk was amplified in late 2002 when the Ontario government abandoned the
	deregulation of the retail electricity market. Thus far, the wholesale market remains unregulated,
	but there can be no assurance that this will continue. Political risk is beyond the control of
	Bruce Power.
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	Of the remaining risks, the most significant is directly related to the operating performance of
	Bruce Power&#146;s generating assets. Bruce Power manages this risk through preventive maintenance to
	improve overall equipment reliability, by adopting more efficient operational processes and by
	improving employee performance at all levels.
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	Another category of risk is electricity price. Bruce Power mitigates this risk by entering into
	long-term, fixed-price supply contracts with reliable customers for the delivery of a significant
	portion of its annual generation. Electricity generated, but not covered by such contracts, is sold
	on the wholesale spot market and is subject to prices in effect at the time of delivery.
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	Most long-term supply agreements obligate Bruce Power to deliver electricity at a predetermined
	contractual price. Credit risk arises from these contracts. On the one hand, the counterparty must
	have the financial resources to take delivery and pay for contracted electricity. On the other
	hand, if quoted forward market prices exceed contracted prices, then the counter-party has the
	right, in most cases, to request financial assurance to mitigate the possibility that Bruce Power
	does not deliver the electricity as contracted. In such circumstances, Cameco&#146;s contingent
	obligations may increase if it is called upon to guarantee its share of Bruce Power&#146;s obligation.

<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	To maintain the economic benefit of the electricity supply contracts, Cameco and its partners must
	have the financial ability to address this credit risk.
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	A further risk category relates to the transmission grid. The ability of Bruce Power to deliver
	electricity to its customers is dependent on the provincial transmission grid, owned and maintained
	by Hydro One, an Ontario provincial Crown corporation. Bruce Power&#146;s ability to deliver power to
	customers is also dependent on the inter-linked North American power grid. Any adverse conditions
	such as severe weather or inadequate maintenance that results in unreliable performance by the grid
	could cause significant financial loss to Bruce Power. Transmission grid risks are beyond Bruce
	Power&#146;s control.
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	Bruce Power&#146;s anticipated contribution to Cameco&#146;s financial results in a given year could be
	significantly impacted if the aggregate capacity factor is less than expected due to planned
	outages extending significantly beyond their scheduled periods or if there are one or more
	unplanned outages which, in aggregate, are for an extended period.
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	Bruce Power is subject to extensive federal regulation with respect to nuclear waste management.
	Failure to comply with such regulation could lead to prosecution and could subject Bruce Power to
	fines and other penalties, including the revocation of operating licences for its nuclear
	generation facilities.
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	The occurrence of any of these events could adversely affect Bruce Power&#146;s expected contribution to
	Cameco&#146;s financial results.
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	Cameco indirectly owns 31.6% of limited partnership interest in Bruce Power, and as a result, does
	not have control over the declaration and payment of cash distributions by Bruce Power.

	CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES
</I>
</B>
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	Cameco prepares its consolidated financial statements in accordance with Canadian GAAP. In
	doing so, management is required to make various estimates and judgments in determining the
	reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses for each year presented, and in
	the disclosure of commitments and contingencies. Management bases its estimates and judgments on
	its own experience, guidelines established by the Canadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy and
	Petroleum and various other factors believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Management
	believes the following critical accounting estimates reflect its more significant judgments used in
	the preparation of the consolidated financial statements.
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	Depreciation and depletion on property, plant and equipment is primarily calculated using the unit
	of production method. This method allocates the cost of an asset to each period based on current
	period production as a portion of total lifetime production or a portion of estimated recoverable
	ore reserves. Estimates of lifetime production and amounts of recoverable reserves are subject to
	judgment and significant change over time. If actual reserves prove to be significantly different
	than the estimates, there could be a material impact on the amounts of depreciation and depletion
	charged to earnings.
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	Significant decommissioning and reclamation activities are often not undertaken until substantial
	completion of the useful lives of the productive assets. Regulatory requirements and alternatives

	with respect to these activities are subject to change over time. A significant change to either
	the estimated costs or recoverable reserves may result in a material change in the amount charged
	to earnings. Cameco accounts for its obligations associated with the retirement of tangible
	long-lived assets in accordance with CICA Handbook Section&nbsp;3110, Asset Retirement Obligations.
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	Cameco assesses the carrying values of property, plant and equipment, and goodwill annually or more
	frequently if warranted by a change in circumstances. If it is determined that carrying values of
	assets or goodwill cannot be recovered, the unrecoverable amounts are written off against current
	earnings. Recoverability is dependent upon assumptions and judgments regarding future prices, costs
	of production, sustaining capital requirements and economically recoverable ore reserves. A
	material change in assumptions may significantly impact the potential impairment of these assets.
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	Cameco uses derivative financial and commodity instruments to reduce exposure to fluctuations in
	foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and commodity prices. As long as these instruments
	are effective, they have the effect of offsetting future changes in these underlying rates and
	prices. Future earnings may be adversely impacted should these instruments become ineffective.
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	Cameco operates in a number of tax jurisdictions and is therefore required to estimate its income
	taxes in each of these tax jurisdictions in preparing its consolidated financial statements. In
	calculating the income taxes, consideration is given to factors such as tax rates in the different
	jurisdictions, non-deductible expenses, valuation allowances, changes in tax laws and management&#146;s
	expectations of future results. Cameco estimates future income taxes based on temporary
	differences between the income and losses reported in its consolidated financial statements and its
	taxable income and losses as determined under the applicable tax laws. The tax effect of these
	temporary differences is recorded as future tax assets or liabilities in the consolidated financial
	statements. The calculation of income taxes requires the use of judgment and estimates. If these
	judgments and estimates prove to be inaccurate, future earnings may be materially impacted.

	ACCOUNTING CHANGE
</I>
</B>
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	In January&nbsp;2005, Cameco revised the accounting for the non-routine and complex restructuring
	transactions that helped create Centerra Gold Inc., resulting in a restatement of the previously
	issued interim financial statements for the periods ended June&nbsp;30, 2004 and September&nbsp;30, 2004.
	The original accounting for these transactions had been carefully analysed and assessed by
	management and reviewed by our external auditors.
<P ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	The change to the accounting for the restructuring transactions resulted from a final review in the
	course of preparing the year-end audited financial statements, when a decision was reached by
	management and our external auditors that a more appropriate basis of accounting for the
	transactions existed. Cameco has concluded that the use of a less appropriate method of accounting
	could be deemed to be the result of a significant deficiency in the design or operation of its
	internal controls regarding the application of generally accepted accounting principles and the
	review process of the implementation of accounting guidance.

	As part of Cameco&#146;s corporate governance practices, under Cameco&#146;s audit committee charter, the
	audit committee is required to pre-approve the audit and non-audit services performed by the
	external auditors. Unless a type of service is to be provided by the external auditors receives
	general pre-approval, it requires specific pre-approval by Cameco&#146;s audit committee or audit
	committee chair, or in the absence of the audit committee chair, a member of the audit committee as
	designated by the audit committee. All pre-approvals granted pursuant to the delegated authority
	must be presented by the member(s) who granted the pre-approvals to the full audit committee at its
	next meeting. The audit committee has adopted a written policy to provide procedures to implement
	the foregoing principles.
