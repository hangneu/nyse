	as set forth in the H.10 weekly statistical release of the Federal Reserve Board. Unless otherwise noted, all translations from
	Renminbi to U.S. dollars in this annual report were made at a rate of RMB6.4778 to US$1.00, the noon buying rate in effect as of

	imposes control over its foreign currency reserves in part through direct regulation of the conversion of Renminbi into foreign
	exchange and through restrictions on foreign trade. On May 6, 2016, the noon buying rate as set forth in the H.10 weekly statistical
	release of the Federal Reserve Board was RMB6.4970 to US$1.00.

	Demand for our products substantially depends
	on general economic conditions in our target markets. The economies of many countries around the world, including those in our
	target markets, experienced a period of slow economic growth and adverse credit market conditions as a result of the global financial
	crisis in 2008 and 2009 and the subsequent sovereign debt crisis in Europe. As PV projects generally require significant upfront
	capital expenditures, our customers historically have relied on financing for the purchase of our products. As a result of weakened
	macroeconomic conditions and in particular adverse credit market conditions, our customers experienced difficulty in obtaining
	financing on attractive terms or at all. As a result, growth rate of demand for PV modules has declined significantly since the
	fourth quarter of 2008. Although credit market conditions have improved since the second quarter of 2009, which contributed to
	an increase in demand for our products, demand for our products slowed again in the first and fourth quarters of 2011, the third
	quarter of 2012, the first quarter of 2013, the first quarter of 2014 and the first quarter of 2015. This slowed demand was primarily
	caused by seasonal factors, including challenging weather conditions and holidays, as well as the adjustments to subsidies and
	economic incentives for PV installations as part of government austerity measures in many countries. In addition, overall supply
	of PV modules has increased due to production capacity expansion by PV module manufacturers worldwide in recent years which, together
	with slower growth in demand for PV modules and increasingly severe market competition, resulted in lower prices for PV modules
	beginning in the fourth quarter of 2008. The decrease in the average selling price of our PV modules caused our gross profit margin
	to decrease significantly from 16.7% for 2011 to negative 3.2% for 2012. While we achieved gross profit of 10.9% for 2013, 17.3%
	for 2014, and 11.9% for 2015, we continued to incur operating and net losses in 2013, 2014 and 2015. There can be no assurance
	that the demand for our products will increase or remain at the current level or such demand will not decline again in the near
	future, or our cost saving efforts will improve our profitability or prevent our profit margin from declining further. While the
	average selling price of our PV modules has stabilized somewhat since the second quarter of 2013, it decreased again in 2015 and
	there can be no assurance that we will not experience further decreases in the average selling price of our PV modules in the future
	or further declines in demand for our products, which may materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of
	operations.

	In the past we have relied primarily on
	borrowings from commercial banks to fund a significant portion of our capital expenditures and working capital needs, and we expect
	to continue doing so in the future. Substantial doubt exists as to our ability to continue as a going concern. We have incurred
	significant net losses in recent years. For the years ended December 31, 2013, 2014 and 2015, our net loss was RMB2.1 billion,
	RMB1.4 billion, and RMB5.9 billion (US$910.6 million), respectively. As of December 31, 2015, we had a total deficit attributable
	to Yingli Green Energy of RMB5.9 billion (US$916.9 million) and a deficit in working capital of RMB7.3 billion (US$1.1 billion).
	As of December 31, 2015, we had cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash of RMB1.6 billion (US$245.1 million) and short-term
	borrowings, including the current portion of medium-term notes described below and long-term debt, of RMB9.1 billion (US$1.4 billion).
	The medium-term notes were issued by our major manufacturing subsidiaries, Baoding Tianwei Yingli New Energy Resources Co., Ltd.,
	or Tianwei Yingli, and Yingli Energy (China) Company Ltd., or Yingli China. As of December 31, 2015 and the date of this annual
	report, we have medium-term notes of RMB2,057 million outstanding, including (i) RMB357 million of the RMB-denominated unsecured
	five-year medium-term notes issued by Tianwei Yingli in 2010 (the &ldquo;2010 MTNs&rdquo;), which became due on October 13, 2015,
	(ii) RMB1.4 billion of the RMB-denominated unsecured five-year medium-term notes issued by Tianwei Yingli in 2011 (the &ldquo;2011
	MTNs&rdquo;), which became due on May 12, 2016, and (iii) RMB300 million of RMB-denominated five-year medium-term notes issued
	by Yingli China in 2012 (the &ldquo;2012 MTNs&rdquo;), which will become due on May 3, 2017. We have had meetings with holders
	of the medium-term notes several times and have been negotiating with them about the repayment schedule of the medium-term notes.
	We proposed to holders of the 2010 MTNs and 2011 MTNs not to require Tianwei Yingli to repay the 2010 MTNs and 2011 MTNs before
	we obtain sufficient financial resources for such repayment while maintaining our operations. We have been negotiating with holders
	of the 2010 MTNs and 2011 MTNs and different funding sources about alternative financing plans that may enable Tianwei Yingli to
	repay these notes, such as 1) introduction of strategic investors to invest into Yingli Green Energy and our subsidiaries, 2) introduction
	of new creditors to grant new borrowings to Yingli Green Energy or our subsidiaries, and 3) sales of certain long-lived assets
	including land use rights to obtain additional funds. The plan for the sales of long-lived assets, if executed, will take more
	than one year to complete. As of the date of this annual report, these negotiations are still in progress and holders of the 2010
	MTNs and 2011 MTNs have not demanded repayment of the 2010 MTNs or the 2011 MTNs. See Item 5.B. &ldquo;Liquidity and Capital Resources&mdash;Liquidity
	and Going Concern&rdquo;. We cannot assure you, however, that these negotiations will result in any agreement with holders of the
	2010 MTNs or 2011 MTNs, and we cannot assure you that holders of the 2010 MTNs and 2011 MTNs will not demand Tianwei Yingli to
	repay these notes, which are already due, or take other actions against Tianwei Yingli in the future. As Tianwei Yingli is one
	of our major operating subsidiaries, its substantial indebtedness that are already due and its noteholders&rsquo; rights to enforce
	such debts, as well as our other substantial indebtedness and our net losses, may materially and adversely affect our business,
	financial condition and results of operations, as well as our ability to meet our payment obligations.

	Our ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon our continued operations, which in turn is
	dependent upon our ability to meet our financial requirements, raise additional capital, and the success of our future operations,

	our target markets as well as the supply and prices of PV modules in the market, our ability to reach agreements with our creditors
	to extend the repayment dates of our debts or renew such debts as necessary until we have the financial resources for their repayment,

	we may have to liquidate our assets, and the value we receive for our assets in liquidation or dissolution could be significantly
	lower than the values reflected in our audited consolidated financial statements. Our lack of cash resources and our potential
	inability to continue as a going concern may materially and adversely affect the price of our ADSs and our ability to raise new

	We require a significant amount of cash
	to fund our operations. In 2015, due to our tight operating cash flow, we had to reduce the utilization rate of our production
	facilities, which caused substantial decrease in our PV module shipments (excluding PV module shipments to the Company's own downstream
	PV projects in China) from 3,101 MW in 2014 to 2,382 MW in 2015 and contributed to the substantial decrease in our net revenues
	from RMB12.9 billion in 2014 to RMB10.0 billion in 2015. This in turn had a material adverse effect on our gross profit, which
	decreased from RMB2.2 billion in 2014 to RMB1.2 billion in 2015. We also recorded an impairment loss of approximately RMB3.8 billion
	in 2015 for property, plant and equipment with respect to the production facilities based on the difference between carrying value
	and fair value of such long-lived assets, which had a material adverse effect on our results of operations. Our ability to increase
	or maintain the utilization rate of our production capacity, net revenues and gross profits and prevent any further impairment
	loss for our production facilities will depend to a significant degree on our ability to obtain sufficient amount of additional
	cash and liquidity to fund our operations. We also require a significant amount of cash to meet our debt repayment obligations.

	Our loan agreements with commercial banks
	in China generally contain financial covenants, which require us to maintain certain financial ratios, such as debt-to-asset ratios
	and coverage ratios. Other restrictive covenants in our loan agreements require us to obtain written consents from the commercial
	banks before we conclude certain transactions, such as providing guarantees to third parties or disposing of material assets. These
	covenants could limit our ability to plan for or react to market conditions or to meet our capital needs in a timely manner and

	may continue to incur significant losses and liabilities, which have had and may continue to adversely impact our ability to comply
	with the covenants of our outstanding loans. Such breach may constitute an event of default, and if the relevant lenders do not
	grant us a waiver for any breach of a covenant, the breach may trigger an acceleration of the amounts due under the relevant loan
	agreements. Some of our loan agreements also contain cross-default provisions enabling lenders under such loan agreements to declare

	If financing for solar energy projects
	continues to become more costly or inaccessible, the growth of the market for solar energy applications may be materially and adversely
	affected which could adversely affect demand for our products and materially reduce our revenue and profits. The demand for our
	products, as reflected by the average selling price of our PV modules, has decreased significantly since the fourth quarter of
	2008, due partly to tightened credit for financing PV system projects as the result of the global financial crisis in 2008 and
	2009 and the subsequent sovereign debt crisis in Europe. In addition, rising interest rates could render existing financings more
	expensive, as well as hinder potential financings that otherwise would spur the growth of the PV industry. Furthermore, some countries,
	government agencies and the private sector have, from time to time, provided subsidies or financing on preferred terms for rural
	electrification programs. Some of our products are used in &ldquo;off-grid&rdquo; solar energy applications, where solar energy
	is provided to end users independent of an electricity transmission grid. We believe that the availability of financing could have
	a significant effect on sales of off-grid solar energy applications, particularly in developing countries where users otherwise
	may not have sufficient resources or credit to acquire PV systems. If these existing financing programs are reduced or eliminated,
	or if financing for solar energy projects continues to be in short supply or become more expensive, demand for our products would
	be materially and adversely affected and our revenue and profits could decline as a result.

	Demand for our products substantially depends
	on government incentives aimed at promoting greater use of solar power. In many countries where we are currently active or intend
	to become active, PV markets generally &mdash; and the market for &ldquo;on-grid&rdquo; PV systems in particular &mdash; would
	not be viable commercially without government incentives. This is because the costs of generating electricity from solar power

	The scope of government incentives for
	solar power depends largely on political and policy developments in a given country related to environmental, economic or other
	concerns, which could lead to a significant reduction in or a discontinuation of the support for renewable energy sources in such
	country. For example, subsidies have been reduced or eliminated in some countries such as Germany, Italy, Spain, the United Kingdom
	and China. In June&nbsp;2012, the German government passed the PV amendment to its renewable energy law (EEG) 2012, which changed
	the 52 gigawatts capacity threshold, reduced the available PV rate, revised the volume-based degression schedule, and limited the
	amount of electricity that PV generators can export to the grid. On July&nbsp;5, 2013, the Italian government discontinued feed-in
	tariff payments, and feed-in tariffs for new solar PV projects have not been available since July&nbsp;2013. In August&nbsp;2013,
	the National Development and Reform Commission, or the NDRC, of China adjusted feed-in tariffs for utility scale PV projects from
	the nationwide benchmark price of RMB1.00 per kWh to three regional variations of RMB0.90 per kWh, RMB0.95 per kWh and RMB1.00
	per kWh, based on solar resources and construction costs in the relevant regions. The feed-in tariff policy applied to all PV plants
	approved after September&nbsp;1, 2013, and those approved before that date but not commissioned until on or after January 1, 2014.
	In December 2015, the NDRC issued a statement that the feed-in tariff would be further reduced by RMB0.02 to RMB0.10 per kWh for
	on-grid utility scale PV projects in 2016. In addition, in certain countries, including countries to which we export PV products,
	government financial support of PV products has been, and may continue to be, challenged as being unconstitutional or otherwise
	unlawful. A significant reduction in the scope or discontinuation of government incentive programs, especially in our target markets,
	would have a material and adverse effect on the demand for our PV modules as well as our results of operations.

	On September&nbsp;5 and November&nbsp;8,
	2012, respectively, the European Commission initiated anti-dumping and anti-subsidy investigations into crystalline silicon photovoltaic,
	or CSPV, wafers, cells, and modules from China. On June 4, 2013, the European Commission issued its provisional anti-dumping determination
	and on August&nbsp;2, 2013, the European Commission accepted an undertaking, or the Undertaking, made by a group of Chinese PV
	products exporters (including us) jointly with the China Chamber of Commerce for Import and Export of Machinery and Electronic
	Products, or CCCME. Pursuant to the Undertaking, certain Chinese exporters would limit their exports of solar panels to the EU
	to a certain quota and set prices above a minimum price, in exchange for the EU agreeing to forgo the imposition of anti-dumping
	duties on these solar panels from China. CCCME was responsible for allocating the quota among these exporters, and we were allocated
	a portion of the quota. On December 5, 2013, the Council of the European Union adopted the final findings of the European Commission
	and imposed anti-dumping and anti-subsidy duties on CSPV modules and key components (i.e. cells) originating in or consigned from
	the PRC. Wafers were excluded from the scope of products subject to these final findings. The anti-dumping duty rates ranged from
	27.3% to 64.9%, while the anti-subsidy duty rates ranged from 0% to 11.5%. The anti-dumping duty and anti-subsidy duty rates applicable
	to us are 35.5% and 6.3%, respectively. The definitive duties are being imposed for a two-year period starting from December&nbsp;6,
	2013. At the same time, the Council of the European Union also confirmed the European Commission&rsquo;s acceptance of the Undertaking.
	While we were exempted from paying any anti-dumping and anti-subsidy duties to the EU starting from August&nbsp;6, 2013, increased
	sale prices and reduced consumption in the European market under the Undertaking may bring significant uncertainties to our business
	in the European market. For example, increased price for our modules sold in EU has made returns for some ground-mounted solar
	projects of our customers less attractive and demand in large-utility projects have declined in Europe compared with the period
	before the effectiveness of the Undertaking. We also face competitions from modules manufactured in third countries at a lower
	price than ours. In addition, if we breach or withdraw from the Undertaking, or the European Commission withdraws its acceptance
	of the Undertaking, the anti-dumping and anti-subsidy duties previously applicable to us would automatically apply to us at the
	prior rates. Thus, there can be no assurance that our entry into and performance of the Undertaking will entirely protect our business
	in Europe and results of operations from and against any and all potential material and adverse effects of anti-dumping and anti-subsidy
	duties.

	We also export a substantial amount of
	our products to the United States. In 2015, our sales to the United States accounted for 12.5% of our total revenue, compared to
	2.0% in 2009, 14.6% in 2011 and 21.7% in 2013. On November&nbsp;7, 2012, the U.S. International Trade Commission, or the ITC, determined
	that CSPV modules produced from Chinese cells were materially injuring the U.S. CSPV cells and modules industry. On October&nbsp;10,
	2012, the U.S. Department of Commerce, or the DOC, had issued its final determinations on rates of anti-dumping, or AD, and countervailing
	duties, or CVD, to be applied to CSPV cells and modules imported from China. As a result of these final determinations, we, as
	a voluntary respondent, became subject to an average aggregated AD/CVD rate of 29.18%. However, this average aggregated AD/CVD
	rate is subject to change due to the administrative review process initiated by the DOC in early 2014. We were a mandatory respondent
	in the first administrative review on the AD investigation and had obtained a much lower preliminary AD rate than in the original
	investigations. In July 2015, the DOC issued the final results of the first administrative review of the AD and CVD orders regarding
	the import of solar PV panels assembled in China using components from China. According to these final results, our manufacturing
	affiliates received the lowest combined tariff rate of their peers, amounting to 21.73%, which is lower than the previous combined

	On January&nbsp;23, 2014, the DOC initiated
	a parallel AD investigation into CSPV products from Mainland China and Taiwan and a CVD investigation into CSPV products from Mainland

	and/or panels assembled in Mainland China and Taiwan consisting of CSPV cells that were completed or partially manufactured within
	a customs territory other than Mainland China and Taiwan, using ingots, wafers that were manufactured in Mainland China and Taiwan,
	or cells where the manufacturing process began in Mainland China and Taiwan and was completed in other countries. On December&nbsp;23,

	As a result of the respective determinations of the DOC and the ITC, Chinese modules integrating cells from third countries will
	be subject to the new AD and CVD tariffs when exported to the US. Although our US sales of modules incorporating third country
	cells are very limited, the DOC&rsquo;s and ITC&rsquo;s determinations could materially and adversely affect our flexibility and

	8, 2016, the DOC published the preliminary result, and the final result for the Solar1 CVD AR2 is expected to be published no
	later than July 12, 2016. On February 3, 2016, the DOC initiated the third administrative review of antidumping duty
	(&ldquo;Solar 1 AD AR3&rdquo;) on CSPC whether or not assembled into modules (certain solar cells and panels) from the PRC
	covering the period of December 1, 2014 to November 30, 2015. Subject merchandise includes crystalline silicon PV, modules or
	panels, whether or not partially or fully assembled into other products, including, but not limited to modules, laminates,
	and building integrated materials. On February 4, 2016, the U.S. Customs and Border Protection, or US CBP, released
	data concerning the imports of solar cells and modules from the PRC. On the same day, we, as a listed party, were required by
	the DOC to file a Quantity &amp; Value, or Q&amp;V, questionnaire which affords interested parties an opportunity to request
	an administrative review or to avoid being selected as a mandatory respondent by providing responses to the questionnaire
	by February 24, 2016. We have filed the Q&amp;V and provided all required documents by the DOC. On March 31, 2016, the
	DOC informed us that we are not selected as mandatory respondent in this third AD review. The deadline to withdraw
	Yingli&rsquo;s review request for Solar 1 AD AR3 is May 9, 2016, and we have filed a letter with the DOC withdrawing
	Yingli&rsquo;s request for a review in Solar 1 AD AR3 on May 4, 2016, In this situation, we will be assigned the average of
	the margins calculated for Trina and Canadian Solar in the final results of Solar 1 AD AR3 if only Yingli withdraws. &nbsp;If
	both Yingli and Solar World withdraw the review requests, we would no longer be under review and the entries of subject
	merchandise into the United States during the AR3 review period (December 1, 2014 &ndash; November 30, 2015) would be
	liquidated at the AD rates applicable at the time of entry (i.e., 13.94% for entries between December 1, 2014 and July 13,
	2015, and 0.79% for entries between July 14, 2015 and November 30, 2015). On February 4, 2016, the US CBP released data
	concerning the imports of solar cells and modules from the PRC related to an anti-subsidy investigation of Chinese companies
	(&ldquo;Solar 1 CVD AR3&rdquo;). We were selected as a mandatory party by the DOC on March 10, 2016. The deadline for us to
	withdraw Solar 1 CVD AR3 is May 9, 2016. However, we have already withdrawn the review on March 17, 2016, and in this

	In response to the industry-wide
	shortage of polysilicon in recent years until the third quarter of 2008, we had entered into short-, medium- and long-term
	supply contracts with fixed or adjustable prices guided by set formulas to secure our supply of polysilicon. Since the fourth
	quarter of 2008, the price of polysilicon has decreased significantly as a result of increased industry-wide polysilicon
	manufacturing capacity and downward price pressure exerted by decreasing average selling prices of PV modules. To address
	this significant decrease in polysilicon prices, we have renegotiated, and are still negotiating, with our polysilicon
	suppliers to reduce purchase prices for a substantial amount of polysilicon supplied under certain of our polysilicon supply
	contracts. In 2013, we achieved significant progress in these negotiations, and purchase prices under certain of our
	long-term polysilicon supply contracts were close to the market price of polysilicon. In 2011, we recognized a total non-cash
	provision of RMB851.7 million on our inventory purchase commitments under long-term polysilicon supply contracts as a result
	of lower polysilicon prices. We periodically reassess the purchase commitments under those supply contracts to make sure if
	additional provision should be recognized, the assessment is made applying a methodology similar to that used in the lower of
	cost or market evaluation with respect to inventory, using our best estimates of future purchase prices over the remaining
	terms of the contracts and applying such estimated purchase prices in the lower of cost or market evaluation. In estimating
	the renegotiated purchase prices, we considered the pertinent terms of each of the long-term supply contracts, the history
	and progress of renegotiation with the relevant vendors and the actual price concessions granted, the polysilicon market
	development based on available industry research data and the likelihood of achieving different levels of renegotiated prices
	for future periods. We did not recognize such a provision in 2012 and 2014. In 2013, we recognized additional provisions of
	RMB393.0 million. In 2015, we did not recognize additional contingency losses for inventory firm purchase commitment.
	However, due to significant fluctuation in the foreign exchange rates between Renminbi and U.S. dollars and given that the
	inventory purchase commitment is dominated in U.S. dollars, which is different from the functional currency of our related
	subsidiaries, we recognized a foreign exchange re-measurement loss of RMB 77.7 million. We determined that such provision was
	not needed in 2014 since the foreign exchange rate was stable and the provision caused by the foreign exchange rate
	fluctuation was immaterial. Our management has been negotiating with our other suppliers on adjusting the prices under these
	long-term contracts. In 2013 and 2015, we failed to purchase contractual volume as stated in the long-term contract with
	another supplier. Unlike the take or pay obligation for the previous vendor mentioned above, under the agreement with the
	latter vendor mentioned above, if we fail to take the full amount of the agreed annual quantity in any calendar year, we are not
	required to pay for the remaining annual commitment, but rather only forfeit the unutilized portion of the prepayment we made
	related to that year. Further, we don&rsquo;t have the right to utilize this prepayment for deliveries in the following
	years. This supplier claimed that certain advance payments had been forfeited according to the contractual terms. In 2013 and
	2015, we recognized provisions of RMB87.1 million and RMB 71.3 million against the forfeited advance payments. We also
	recognized a provision of RMB 450.8 million in 2015 on the prepayment in relation to our inventory purchase commitments under
	the long-term contract with this supplier for the remaining contract period as we estimated that we will also fail to
	purchase contractual volume as stated in the long-term contract in the remaining contract period in the future. Should the
	results of these ongoing negotiations differ from the assessment based on which we recognized such provisions in 2011, 2013
	and 2015, these provisions would need to be adjusted accordingly to reflect such a new assessment. If the prices under our
	current contracts remain higher than prices for polysilicon available in the market, we may incur higher polysilicon costs
	relative to other competitors who purchase their polysilicon from the spot market.

	Until the third quarter of 2008, there
	had been an industry-wide shortage of polysilicon, primarily due to growing demand for PV products and limited supply of polysilicon,
	which resulted in increasing prices of polysilicon under both long-term supply contracts and on the spot market. From the fourth
	quarter of 2008 until the second quarter of 2009, as a result of increased industry-wide polysilicon manufacturing capacity and
	a decrease in demand for polysilicon due to the global financial crisis in 2008 and 2009, polysilicon prices decreased significantly.
	Although polysilicon prices rebounded between the third quarter of 2010 and the first quarter of 2011 due in part to stronger demand
	for PV products in certain markets, polysilicon prices again decreased significantly since the second quarter of 2011 as a result
	of increased polysilicon manufacturing capacity and downward price pressure exerted by lower average selling prices for PV modules.
	In 2012, polysilicon prices continued to decline and reached approximately US$14 per kilogram in November&nbsp;2012. Since June
	2013, polysilicon prices began to increase and reached approximately US$22 per kilogram until the first half of 2014. From the
	second half of 2014, polysilicon price began to decrease slightly and the spot market price fluctuated under US$20 per kilogram

	In 2012, the Ministry of Commerce of the
	People&rsquo;s Republic of China, or MOFCOM, initiated anti-dumping and anti-subsidy investigations into imports of solar-grade
	polysilicon originating from the United States, South Korea and the European Union. On January 20, 2014, MOFCOM issued its final
	determination to impose anti-dumping and anti-subsidy duties for five years on imports of solar-grade polysilicon originating from
	the United States and South Korea at aggregated rates ranging from 2.4% to 59.1%. On January 24, 2014, MOFCOM issued a preliminary
	ruling that imports of solar-grade polysilicon originating from the European Union had been subsidized at a rate of 10.7% and were
	sold at dumping price margins from 21.8% to 68.9%. On March&nbsp;20, 2014, MOFCOM announced that it had accepted an undertaking
	proposal submitted by Wacker Chemie AG, an EU-based supplier of solar-grade polysilicon. According to Wacker, this undertaking
	agreement will be effective from May&nbsp;1, 2014 until the end of April 2016. The undertaking agreement specifies that MOFCOM
	will refrain from applying anti-dumping and anti-subsidy duties on Wacker&rsquo;s products in exchange for Wacker&rsquo;s undertaking
	that it will not sell polysilicon produced at its European plants below a specific minimum price in China. Polysilicon is one of
	the major raw materials we need for the production of wafers, which also affects the production of PV cells and modules. A large
	portion of the polysilicon we use is sourced from countries that are subject to the investigations mentioned above. Therefore,
	any such anti-dumping or anti-subsidy duties (whether provisional or final) imposed by MOFCOM may increase our cost to produce
	solar modules. Due in part to China&rsquo;s anti-dumping and anti-subsidy investigations into polysilicon manufacturers from the
	United States, the European Union and South Korea, together with an overall increase in demand, polysilicon prices have increased
	since June&nbsp;2013 and reached approximately US$22 per kilogram until the first half of 2014. From the second half of 2014, polysilicon
	price began to decrease slightly and the spot market price fluctuated under US$20 per kilogram as of May 16, 2016. There can be
	no assurance that polysilicon prices in the future will not increase significantly. To the extent that we are not able to pass
	on any increased costs to our customers, we may be placed at a competitive disadvantage relative to our competitors, and our business,
	cash flows, financial condition and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected.

	We made advance payments to some of

	prepayment balances for polysilicon totaling RMB555.5 million (US$85.8 million) under such long-term contracts. We continue
	to renegotiate with some of our polysilicon suppliers on the purchase price of a substantial amount of polysilicon to be

	other market players due to our long-term commitment to purchase polysilicon at fixed prices, and we have failed to perform

	If we fail to reach agreements with such suppliers on the quantities and prices of polysilicon to be supplied under those
	contracts, the suppliers may hold the advance payment and issue claims for further damages. As of December 31, 2015, total
	amount we prepaid to one supplier was RMB 224.0 million under the long-term fixed price supply contract entered into in 2011,
	which is effective from 2013 to 2020. Due to the anti-dumping duty and anti-subsidy investigation against Solar-Grade
	Polysilicon launched by the Ministry of Commerce of the People&rsquo;s Republic of China, we had not made any purchase from
	this supplier. We received invoices from this supplier under our take-or-pay obligation for failing to take the shipments in
	2013 to 2015. Currently, we are in negotiation with this supplier to seek an acceptable solution to both parties. We believe
	that under the &ldquo;take or pay&rdquo; obligation, which required us to pay full amount to this supplier according to the
	purchase and payment schedule listed in the agreements, regardless of whether we actually purchase raw materials from the
	supplier or not, it is probable for us to continue performance of the agreements when we could get an acceptable solution

	If we fail to
	take the full amount of the agreed annual quantity in any calendar year, we do not have to pay for the remaining annual

	that certain advance payments had been forfeited according to the original terms in 2013 and 2015. (In 2014, we purchased the
	required amounts of polysilicon from this supplier and utilized the portion of prepayments related to 2014). Therefore, in
	2013 and 2015, we recognized incremental provisions of RMB87.1 million and RMB71.3 million, respectively,&nbsp;on the
	prepayment in relation to our inventory purchase commitments under the long-term contract with this supplier. We also
	recognized a provision of RMB 450.8 million in 2015&nbsp;on the prepayment in relation to our inventory purchase commitments
	under the long-term contract with this supplier for the remaining contract period&nbsp;as we estimated that we will also fail
	to purchase contractual volume as stated in the long-term contract in the remaining contract period in the future.&nbsp;As
	of December 31,2015, carry value of prepayments to this supplier is RMB277.4 million. In addition, under existing contracts
	with many of our equipment suppliers, consistent with industry practice, we make advance payments to our suppliers prior to
	the scheduled dates on which certain equipment will be delivered. In many such cases, we make advance payments without
	receiving collateral for such payments. As a result, our claims in respect of such payments would rank as unsecured claims,
	which in turn would expose us to the credit risks of our suppliers in the event of their bankruptcy or insolvency. Under
	such circumstances, our claims against defaulting suppliers would rank below those of secured creditors, which would
	undermine our chances of recovering advance payments for which we did not receive any value. Accordingly, any of the above
	scenarios may have a material and adverse effect on our liquidity, financial condition and results of operations.

	In January&nbsp;2009, we acquired Cyber
	Power Group Limited, or Cyber Power, a development stage enterprise designed to produce polysilicon, and its principal operating
	subsidiary in China, Fine Silicon Co.,&nbsp;Ltd., or Fine Silicon, with an intention to establish our own polysilicon production
	operations. Fine Silicon started trial production in late 2009 and was initially expected to reach its full production capacity
	of 3,000 tons of polysilicon per year. However, as market prices for polysilicon have decreased sharply in recent years, Fine Silicon&rsquo;s
	designed production capacity was no longer cost-effective. Currently, Fine Silicon is not manufacturing any meaningful amount of
	polysilicon. We recorded a non-cash impairment of the long-lived assets of Fine Silicon in amounts of RMB2,275.0 million and RMB200.5
	million for 2011 and 2012, respectively, which in the aggregate was equivalent to our writing-down the total value of Fine Silicon&rsquo;s
	equipment. In April&nbsp;2015, Fine Silicon also sold its land use rights to the land underlying its manufacturing facilities as
	well as the attachments thereon to a government entity in Baoding. Although we still may resume the in-house production of polysilicon
	through cooperation with third parties in order to utilize the remaining equipment of Fine Silicon, we do not have any concrete
	plan yet and do not expect that such cooperation will happen in the near future. Even if such cooperation could happen in the future,
	we cannot assure you that it will be successful, or that such cooperation could result in any meaningful in-house production of
	polysilicon at costs comparable to or lower than prevailing market prices. If we fail to do so, we will not be able to realize
	the expected positive effect on our results of operations, and the cost of our polysilicon supply will remain uncertain and vulnerable

	during peak seasons such as summer. In the event that electricity and other energy supplies to our manufacturing facilities are
	disrupted, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected. In addition
	to shortages, we are vulnerable to potential interruptions in our energy supply due to equipment failure, weather events or other
	causes. There can be no assurance that we will not face power-related problems in the future. Even if we had access to reliable

	or yield new products that are commercially viable. In addition, any failure to realize the intended benefits of our product development
	initiatives could limit our ability to keep pace with rapid technological changes in the industry, which in turn would hurt our
	business and prospects. For example, in order to meet increasing demand for our products and further drive down costs through increased
	cell conversion efficiency and manufacturing on a larger scale, we started to implement Project PANDA, a research and development
	project for next-generation high efficiency monocrystalline PV cells, in June&nbsp;2009. By the end of 2015, we achieved an average

	rate of 21.5% in the lab. However, as we are new to monocrystalline technology, we may not be able to overcome all of the technical
	challenges involved in the process of commercializing new technologies developed from Project PANDA. We also may not be able to
	maintain or further improve the cell conversion efficiency rate that we have already achieved. In addition, we have limited experience
	with customer demands in the monocrystalline PV market and may not be able to adapt to the conditions in this market. Established

	The manufacture of PV modules and PV systems
	is a highly complex process. Disruptions or deviations in one or more components of the manufacturing process can cause a substantial
	decrease in output and, in some cases, disrupt production significantly or result in no output. Historically, we from time to time
	experienced lower-than-anticipated manufacturing output during the ramp-up period of our production lines. This often occurred
	during the production of new products, the installation of new equipment or the implementation of new process technologies. In
	addition, we may not able to achieve full utilization of our production facilities due to market and other financial reasons. For
	example, in the fourth quarter of 2012, due to challenging conditions in the solar market and a continuing decline in average selling
	prices of PV modules, we recognized an impairment of long-lived assets of Fine Silicon in an amount of RMB200.5 million and a loss
	of RMB61.7 million related to disposal of certain equipment. In 2015, we recognized a non-cash impairment charge on our long-lived
	assets totaling RMB3,804.1 million (US$587.3 million), which was primarily due to lower-than-expected utilization of certain production
	facilities during certain quarters of 2015. These non-cash charges significantly and adversely affected our results of operations
	in the relevant periods. If we bring additional lines or facilities into production in the future, we may operate at less than
	optimal capacity during the ramp-up period and produce less output than expected. Any of these would result in higher marginal
	production costs which could have a material and adverse effect on our profitability.

	Before September&nbsp;30, 2011, our PV
	modules typically were sold with a two- or five-year limited warranty for defects in materials and workmanship, and a 10-year and
	25-year warranty guaranteeing 90% and 80% of initial power generation capacity, respectively. Starting from October&nbsp;1, 2011,
	we implemented a new and improved warranty term that guarantees 91.2% of nominal power output for 10 years, and 80.7% of nominal
	power output for 25 years for multicrystalline PV modules, and to guarantee 98.0% of nominal power output for the first year, 92.0%
	of nominal power output for 10 years, and 82.0% of nominal power output for 25 years for monocrystalline Panda PV modules. On September
	1, 2014, we updated our warranty terms to guarantee 91.2% of nominal power output for 10 years and 80.7% of nominal power output
	for 25 years for multicrystalline PV modules, and to guarantee 98.0% of nominal power output for the first year, 92.2% of nominal
	power output for 10 years, and 82.4% of nominal power output for 25 years for monocrystalline Panda PV modules. In addition, we
	also provided our multicrystalline PV modules and monocrystalline Panda PV modules with a linear-based warranty that guarantees
	each year&rsquo;s power output during the twenty-five-year warranty period. In 2012, we entered into a module performance warranty
	insurance agreement with Munich Re&rsquo;s specialty primary insurers. According to the agreement, both we and Munich Re could
	provide additional economic security for large-scale commercial and utility project developers, investors and debt providers during
	the period from October&nbsp;1, 2012 to September&nbsp;30, 2013 in connection with our multicrystalline PV modules. In December
	2013, we entered into a similar module performance warranty insurance agreement with another insurance company for the same scope
	of beneficiaries for 2014, and renewed the agreement in March 2015 and in January 2016 for the same scope of beneficiaries for
	2015 and 2016, respectively. Nevertheless, we bear the risk of warranty claims long after we have sold our products and recognized
	revenues. We have only sold PV modules since January&nbsp;2003, and none of our PV modules has been in use for the entire duration
	of its warranty period. As of December&nbsp;31, 2013, 2014 and 2015, our accrued warranty costs amounted to RMB666.9 million, RMB748.4
	million, and RMB792.1 million (US$122.3 million), respectively. Moreover, because our products have only been in use for a relatively
	short period of time, our assumptions regarding the durability and reliability of our products may not be accurate. Since our products
	have relatively long warranty periods, we cannot assure you that the amount of accrued warranty for our products will be adequate
	in light of our products&rsquo; actual performance. If we experience a significant increase in warranty claims, we may incur significant
	repair and replacement costs associated with such claims. Furthermore, widespread product underperformances or failures will damage
	our reputation and customer relationships and may cause our sales to decline, which in turn could have a material and adverse effect

	The failure of any of these or other customers to meet their payment obligations would materially and adversely affect our financial

	senior notes offering, follow-on offering and medium-term notes offering, other debt issuances and long-term bank borrowings, any

	As of May 16, 2016, we have been granted
	1,257 patents and currently are applying for 143 patents. Aside from know-how available in the public domain, we have developed
	in-house unpatented technical know-how that we use to manufacture our products. Many elements of our manufacturing processes involve
	proprietary know-how, technology or data, either developed by us in-house or transferred to us by our equipment suppliers. Such
	proprietary know-how, technology and data are not covered by patents or patent applications, and include manufacturing technologies
	and processes and production line and equipment designs. We rely on a combination of laws and regulations pertaining to patent,
	trademark, anti-unfair competition and trade secret rights, as well as nondisclosure agreements and other methods, to protect our
	intellectual property rights. Nevertheless, these measures provide only limited protection and the actions we take to protect our
	intellectual property rights may not be adequate. Third parties may infringe or misappropriate our proprietary technologies or
	other of our intellectual property rights, which could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition
	or results of operations. Policing unauthorized use of proprietary technology can be difficult and expensive. Also, litigation
	may be necessary to protect our trade secrets or to determine and enforce the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of us
	or of other rights holders. We cannot assure you that the outcome of any such potential litigation will be in our favor. Such litigation
	may be costly and may divert the attention of our management as well as our other resources away from our business. In addition,
	we have no insurance coverage against litigation costs and would have to bear all costs arising from such litigation to the extent
	that we are unable to recover them from other parties. An adverse determination in any such litigation could result in the loss
	of one or more of our intellectual property rights and may materially and adversely harm our business, prospects and reputation.

	We have exported in the past, and expect

	substantially equivalent technologies or otherwise gain access to our proprietary technologies and obtain patents for such intellectual
	properties in other jurisdictions, including the countries to which we export our PV modules. If any third party is successful
	in obtaining one or more patents for technologies that are substantially equivalent to, or the same as, our proprietary technologies
	in any market where we have not obtained such patent protection, and such third party enforces its intellectual property rights
	against us, our ability to sell products containing the allegedly infringing intellectual property in that market will be materially
	and adversely affected. If we are required to stop selling such allegedly infringing products, to seek licenses or to pay royalties
	for the relevant intellectual properties, or to redesign such products so as to refrain from using the allegedly infringing technologies,
	our business, results of operations and financial condition will be materially and adversely affected.

	Our success depends, in large part, on
	our ability to use and develop technology and know-how without infringing the intellectual property rights of third parties. The
	validity and scope of claims relating to PV technology patents involve complex scientific, legal and factual questions and analysis
	and, therefore, may be highly uncertain. Although we take steps in the course of developing our products in order to ensure that
	we are not infringing the existing intellectual property rights of others, such as reviewing related patents and patent applications
	prior to developing our products, these steps may not be adequate. While we currently are not aware of any action pending or threatened
	against us, we may be subject to litigation involving claims of patent infringement or violation of intellectual property rights
	of third parties. Resolving intellectual property disputes and related legal and administrative proceedings can be both costly
	and time-consuming, and may significantly divert the efforts and resources of our technical and management personnel away from
	our business. An adverse determination in any such litigation or proceedings to which we may become a party could subject us to
	significant liability to third parties, require us to seek licenses from third parties, to pay ongoing royalties, or to redesign
	our PV modules or subject us to injunctions prohibiting the manufacture and sale of our PV modules or the use of our technologies
	in certain markets. Protracted litigation also could cause our customers or potential customers to defer or limit their purchase
	or use of our PV modules until a time when such litigation has been resolved.

	Under relevant local regulations in China
	where we have operations, we are required to make contributions to our employees&rsquo; social insurances and housing provident
	fund on a monthly basis, and will be subject to penalties if we delay any of such contributions for more than three months. While
	we had fully accrued required contributions to our employees&rsquo; social insurances and housing provident fund according to relevant
	local regulations in China in 2015, due to our tight cash flow in 2015, some of our subsidiaries failed to fully make contributions
	to the social insurances and housing provident fund for their employees on time and the amount overdue was approximately RMB80.0
	million as of May 16, 2016. As such, these subsidiaries are not in compliance with local regulations on social insurances and housing
	provident fund, and could be subject to penalties from local regulatory authorities. Under PRC laws, potential penalties can reach
	100%-300% of the delayed amount for social insurances and 300%-500% of the delayed amount for housing provident fund. We have engaged
	in active discussions with the relevant local regulatory authorities, clarifying our situation to them and seeking their understanding.
	While the local regulatory authorities indicated that they understood our situation and had not imposed any penalties on us yet,
	there can be no assurance that they will not impose penalties on us in the future. While we plan to gradually pay all overdue amounts
	before the end of 2016, there can be no assurance that we will be able to do so. In addition, our employees may file claims against
	us for, or otherwise have disputes with us resulting from, our failure to make the required contributions and such disputes could
	lead to lengthy and costly lawsuits or other legal proceedings. Any penalties imposed on us by regulatory authorities, any further
	failure on our part to make the required contributions on time and in full, or any disputes with our employees or lawsuits and
	legal proceedings resulting therefrom could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of
	operations.

	In December 2012, the SEC brought administrative proceedings
	against the Big Four accounting firms, including our independent registered public accounting firm, in China, alleging that they
	had refused to produce audit work papers and other documents related to certain other China-based companies under investigation
	by the SEC for potential accounting fraud. On January 22, 2014, an initial administrative law decision, or Initial Decision, was
	issued, censuring these accounting firms and suspending four of the five firms from practicing before the SEC for a period of six
	months. The accounting firms filed a Petition for Review of the Initial Decision to the SEC. On February 6, 2015, the Big Four
	China-based accounting firms each agreed to a censure and to pay a fine to the SEC to settle the dispute and avoid suspension of
	their ability to practice before the SEC and audit U.S.-listed companies. The settlement required the firms to follow detailed
	procedures and to seek to provide the SEC with access to Chinese firms&rsquo; audit documents via the China Securities Regulatory
	Commission, or the CSRC. If future document productions fail to meet specified criteria, the SEC retains authority to impose a
	variety of additional remedial measures on the firms depending on the nature of the failure. While we cannot predict if the SEC
	will further review the four China-based accounting firms&rsquo; compliance with specified criteria or if the results of such a
	review would result in the SEC imposing penalties such as suspensions or restarting the administrative proceedings, if the accounting
	firms are subject to additional remedial measures, our ability to file our financial statements in compliance with SEC requirements
	could be impacted. A determination that we have not timely filed financial statements in compliance with SEC requirements could
	ultimately lead to the delisting of our common stock from NYSE or the termination of the registration of our common stock under
	the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, or both, which would substantially reduce or effectively terminate the trading of our common
	stock in the United States.

	The Ministry of Commerce published a discussion
	draft of the proposed Foreign Investment Law in January 2015 aiming to, upon its enactment, replace the trio of existing laws regulating
	foreign investment in China, namely, the Sino-foreign Equity Joint Venture Enterprise Law, the Sino-foreign Cooperative Joint Venture
	Enterprise Law and the Wholly Foreign-invested Enterprise Law, together with their implementation rules and ancillary regulations.
	The draft Foreign Investment Law embodies an expected PRC regulatory trend to rationalize its foreign investment regulatory regime
	in line with prevailing international practice and the legislative efforts to unify the corporate legal requirements for both foreign
	and domestic investments. The Ministry of Commerce has solicited comments on this draft and substantial uncertainties exist with
	respect to its enactment timetable, the final version, interpretation and implementation. The draft Foreign Investment Law, if
	enacted as proposed, may materially impact our corporate governance practice and increase our compliance costs. For instance, the
	draft Foreign Investment Law imposes stringent ad hoc and periodic information reporting requirements on foreign investors and
	the applicable FIEs. Aside from investment implementation report and investment amendment report that are required at each investment
	and alteration of investment specifics, an annual report is mandatory, and large foreign investors meeting certain criteria are
	required to report on a quarterly basis. Any company found to be non-compliant with these information reporting obligations may
	potentially be subject to fines and/or administrative or criminal liabilities, and the persons directly responsible may be subject
	to criminal liabilities. It is uncertain when the draft would be signed into law and whether the final version would have any substantial
	changes from the draft.

	On August&nbsp;8, 2006, six PRC government
	and regulatory authorities, including the PRC Ministry of Commerce, or the MOFCOM, and the Chinese Securities Regulatory Commission,
	or the CSRC, promulgated a rule&nbsp;entitled
<I>
	Provisions regarding Mergers and Acquisitions of Domestic Enterprises by Foreign
	Investors
</I>
	, or the M&amp;A Rule, which became effective on September 8, 2006 and was amended on June&nbsp;22, 2009. The M&amp;A
	Rule, as amended, among other things, established procedures and requirements that could make merger and acquisition activities
	by foreign investors time-consuming and complex, including requirements in some instances that the MOFCOM be notified in advance
	of any change-of-control transaction in which a foreign investor takes control of a PRC domestic enterprise or of a foreign company
	with substantial PRC operations, if certain thresholds are triggered under the Provisions on Thresholds for Prior Notification
	of Concentrations of Undertakings, issued by the State Council on August 3, 2008. Furthermore, MOFCOM promulgated the
<I>
	Rules&nbsp;of
	Ministry of Commerce on Implementation of Security Review System of Mergers and Acquisition of Domestic Enterprises by Foreign
	Investors
</I>
	in August&nbsp;2011, or the MOFCOM Security Review Rules, which came into effect on September&nbsp;1, 2011, to implement
	the
<I>
	Notice of the General Office of the State Council on Establishing the Security Review System for Mergers and Acquisitions
	of Domestic Enterprises by Foreign Investors
</I>
	promulgated on February&nbsp;3, 2011, or Circular No. 6. According to Circular
	No.&nbsp;6, a security review is required for mergers and acquisitions by foreign investors of PRC domestic enterprises (i)&nbsp;having
	&ldquo;national defense and security&rdquo; concerns, and (ii)&nbsp;where the foreign investors may acquire the &ldquo;de facto
	control&rdquo; of PRC domestic enterprises having national security concerns such as key farm products, key energy and resources,
	and key infrastructure, transportation, technology and major equipment manufacturing industries. Circular No.&nbsp;6, however,
	does not define the terms &ldquo;key&rdquo; or &ldquo;major&rdquo;, nor has it exhausted all of the industries that may be deemed
	as sensitive industries subject to a security review. When deciding whether a specific merger or acquisition of a domestic enterprise
	by foreign investors is subject to a security review by MOFCOM, the principle of &ldquo;substance over form&rdquo; should be applied.
	Foreign investors are prohibited from bypassing the security review requirement by structuring transactions through nominee holding
	structures, trusts, indirect investments, leases, loans, control through contractual arrangements, offshore transactions, or other
	means. We believe that our current business is not in an industry that is sensitive or related to national security. However, we
	cannot preclude the possibility that MOFCOM or other government agencies may release interpretations or new rules contrary to our
	understanding, or broaden the scope of such security review in the future. In the future, we may grow our business in part by acquiring
	complementary businesses, although we do not have any plans to do so at this time. Complying with the requirements of these regulations
	in order to complete such transactions could be time-consuming, and any required approval processes, including obtaining approval
	from the MOFCOM, may delay or inhibit the completion of such transactions, which could affect our ability to expand our business
	and maintain our market share.

	In 2005, the PRC State Administration of
	Foreign Exchange, or SAFE, issued a number of rules regarding offshore investments by PRC residents. The rule currently in effect,
	the Circular on Relevant Issues Concerning Foreign Exchange Control on Domestic Residents&rsquo; Offshore Investment and Financing
	and Roundtrip Investment through Special Purpose Vehicles, or SAFE Circular 37, was issued on July 4, 2014, which replaced the
	former circular commonly known as SAFE Circular 75 promulgated by SAFE on October 21, 2005. SAFE Circular 37 requires PRC residents
	to register with local branches of SAFE in connection with their direct establishment or indirect control of an offshore entity,
	for the purpose of overseas investment and financing, with such PRC residents&rsquo; legally owned assets or equity interests in
	domestic enterprises or offshore assets or interests, referred to in SAFE Circular 37 as a special purpose vehicle. SAFE Circular
	37 further requires amendment to the registration in the event of any significant changes with respect to the special purpose vehicle,
	such as increase or decrease of capital contributed by PRC individuals, share transfer or exchange, merger, division or other material
	event. In the event that a PRC shareholder holding interests in a special purpose vehicle fails to fulfill the required SAFE registration,
	the PRC subsidiaries of that special purpose vehicle may be prohibited from making profit distributions to the offshore parent
	and from carrying out subsequent cross-border foreign exchange activities, and the special purpose vehicle may be restricted in
	its ability to contribute additional capital into its PRC subsidiary. Furthermore, failure to comply with the various SAFE registration
	requirements described above could result in liability under PRC law for evasion of foreign exchange controls. On February 13,
	2015, SAFE released the Notice on Further Simplifying and Improving Policies for the Foreign Exchange Administration of Direct
	Investment, or SAFE Circular 13, which will become effective on June 1, 2015. According to this notice, local banks will examine
	and handle foreign exchange registration for overseas direct investment, including the initial foreign exchange registration and
	amendment registration, under SAFE Circular 37. However, since the notice has not yet come into effect, there exists a high degree
	of uncertainty as to how it will be interpreted and implemented by governmental authorities and banks. Since we are a Cayman Islands
	company with a substantial portion of our shares held by Yingli Power Holding Company Ltd., a British Virgin Islands company controlled
	by Mr. Liansheng Miao, our chairperson and chief executive officer who is a PRC resident, Mr. Miao is subject to the registration
	requirements under SAFE Circular 37 and other related rules.

	in June 2007, our secondary and convertible senior notes offerings in December 2007, our issuance of senior secured convertible

	The Enterprise Income Tax Law, or the EIT
	Law, and its implementation rules&nbsp;provide that withholding tax at a rate of 10% is applicable to dividends payable to non-PRC
	investors that are &ldquo;non-resident enterprises&rdquo;, to the extent such dividends are derived from sources within the PRC,
	unless any such non-PRC investor&rsquo;s jurisdiction of incorporation has a tax treaty with China that provides for a different
	withholding arrangement. Furthermore, a circular issued on February&nbsp;22, 2008 by the Ministry of Finance, or the MOF, and the
	State Administration of Taxation stipulates that undistributed earnings generated prior to January&nbsp;1, 2008 are exempt from
	enterprise income tax. We are a Cayman Islands holding company, Yingli Green Energy (International) Holding Company Limited, or
	Yingli International, is a British Virgin Islands intermediate holding company, and Cyber Lighting Holding Company Limited, or
	Cyber Lighting, is a Hong Kong intermediate holding company. The Cayman Islands and the British Virgin Islands where such holding
	companies are incorporated do not have a tax treaty with China. According to the
<I>
	Arrangement between Mainland China and the
	Hong Kong Special Administrative Region on the Avoidance of Double Taxation and Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with respect to Taxes
	on Income
</I>
	entered into in August&nbsp;2006, or the Mainland and the Hong Kong Taxation Arrangement, subject to the confirmation
	of the local tax authority in charge, dividends paid by a foreign-invested enterprise in China to its direct holding company in
	Hong Kong will be subject to withholding tax at a rate of no more than 5%, if the foreign investor is the &ldquo;beneficial owner&rdquo;
	and owns directly at least 25% the equity interests in the foreign-invested enterprise. Furthermore, the State Administration of
	Taxation promulgated the
<I>
	Notice on How to Understand and Determine the Beneficial Owners in Tax Agreement
</I>
	s in October 2009,
	or Circular 601, which provides guidance for determining whether a resident of a contracting country is the &ldquo;beneficial owner&rdquo;
	of an item of income under China&rsquo;s tax treaties and tax arrangements. According to Circular 601, a beneficial owner generally
	must be engaged in substantive business activities. An agent or conduit company will not be regarded as a beneficial owner and,
	therefore, will not qualify for treaty benefits. A conduit company normally refers to a company that is set up for the purpose
	of avoiding or reducing taxes or transferring or accumulating profits. Substantially all of our income may be derived from dividends
	we receive from our operating subsidiaries located in the PRC. Thus, dividends for earnings accumulated beginning on January 1,
	2008 payable to us by our subsidiaries in China, if any, will be subject to a 10% withholding tax or, in the case of the dividends
	paid to Cyber Lighting, 5% withholding tax (subject to the confirmation of the local tax authority), if we are considered under
	the EIT Law to be a &ldquo;non-resident enterprise&rdquo;. We intend indefinitely to reinvest undistributed earnings accumulated
	in and after 2008 and therefore have not recognized a deferred income tax liability with respect to those earnings. If we are subject
	under the EIT Law to such withholding tax for any dividends we may receive from our subsidiaries, it will materially and adversely
	increase our income tax expenses.

	The EIT Law also provides that enterprises
	established outside China whose &ldquo;de facto management bodies&rdquo; are located in China are considered &ldquo;resident enterprises&rdquo;
	and generally are subject to the uniform 25% enterprise income tax rate as to their worldwide income. Under the implementation
	rules&nbsp;for the EIT Law issued by the State Council, a &ldquo;de facto management body&rdquo; is defined as a body that has
	substantial and overall management and control over the manufacturing and business operations, personnel, accounting, properties
	and other factors of an enterprise. On April&nbsp;22, 2009, the State Administration of Taxation promulgated the
<I>
	Notice Regarding
	the Determination of Chinese-Controlled Overseas Incorporated Enterprises as PRC Tax Resident Enterprises on the Basis of De Facto
	Management Bodies
</I>
	, or SAT Circular 82 which sets out criteria for determining whether &ldquo;de facto management bodies&rdquo;
	are located in China for overseas incorporated, domestically controlled enterprises. However, as this circular only applies to
	enterprises incorporated under laws of foreign countries or regions that are controlled by PRC enterprises or groups of PRC enterprises,
	it remains unclear how the tax authorities will determine the location of &ldquo;de facto management bodies&rdquo; for enterprises
	incorporated overseas that are controlled by individual PRC residents like us and some of our subsidiaries. Therefore, although
	substantially all of our management is currently located in the PRC, it remains unclear whether the PRC tax authorities would require
	or permit our overseas registered entities to be treated as PRC resident enterprises. If the PRC tax authorities determine that
	Yingli Green Energy and some of our subsidiaries, such as Yingli International, Yingli Capital, Yingli Hong Kong, Cyber Power and
	Cyber Lighting, are PRC resident enterprises, we and such subsidiaries may be subject to enterprise income tax at the rate of 25%
	as to our global income, which could have an impact on our effective tax rate and a material and adverse effect on our net income
	and results of operations, although dividends distributed from our PRC subsidiaries to us would be exempt from the PRC dividend
	withholding tax, since such income distribution is exempted under the EIT Law if paid to PRC resident recipients.

	Under the EIT Law and implementation rules&nbsp;issued
	by the State Council, PRC withholding tax at a rate of 10% is applicable to payments of dividends to investors that are &ldquo;non-resident
	enterprises,&rdquo; which do not have an establishment or place of business in the PRC, or which have such establishment or place
	of business but the relevant income is not effectively connected with the establishment or place of business, to the extent that

	dividends to investors who are non-resident individuals, to the extent that such payments of dividends have their sources within
	the PRC. Any gain realized on the transfer of ADSs or ordinary shares by such investors also is subject to PRC income tax if such
	gain constitutes income derived from sources within the PRC. It is currently unclear what constitutes income derived from sources
	within the PRC. Therefore, it is unclear whether dividends we may pay with respect to our ordinary shares or ADSs, or the gain
	you may realize from the transfer of our ordinary shares or ADSs, would be treated as income derived from sources within the PRC
	and be subject to PRC tax if we were treated as a PRC resident enterprise. Furthermore, according to Circular 601, a beneficial
	owner generally must be engaged in substantive business activities. An agent or conduit company will not be regarded as a beneficial
	owner and, therefore, will not qualify for treaty benefits. A conduit company normally refers to a company that is set up for the

	by us to our non-PRC shareholders and ADS holders whose jurisdiction of incorporation has a tax treaty with China providing for
	a different withholding arrangement will be entitled to the benefits under that relevant withholding arrangement. If we are required
	under the EIT Law to withhold PRC income tax on dividends payable to non-PRC holders of our ordinary shares or ADSs, or if you
	are required to pay PRC income tax on the transfer of our ordinary shares or ADSs, the value of your investment in our ordinary

	We face uncertainties with respect to indirect transfers

	On February 3, 2015, the State Administration
	of Taxation issued the Bulletin on Issues of Enterprise Income Tax on Indirect Transfers of Assets by Non-PRC Resident Enterprises,
	or Bulletin 7, which replaced or supplemented previous rules under the Notice on Strengthening Administration of Enterprise Income
	Tax for Share Transfers by Non-PRC Resident Enterprises, or Circular 698, issued by the State Administration of Taxation, on December
	10, 2009. Pursuant to this Bulletin, an &ldquo;indirect transfer&rdquo; of assets, including equity interests in a PRC resident
	enterprise, by non-PRC resident enterprises may be re-characterized and treated as a direct transfer of PRC taxable assets, if
	such arrangement does not have a reasonable commercial purpose and was established for the purpose of avoiding payment of PRC enterprise
	income tax. As a result, gains derived from such indirect transfer may be subject to PRC enterprise income tax. According to Bulletin
	7, &ldquo;PRC taxable assets&rdquo; include assets attributed to an establishment in China, immoveable properties located in China,
	and equity investments in PRC resident enterprises, in respect of which gains from their transfer by a direct holder, being a non-PRC
	resident enterprise, would be subject to PRC enterprise income taxes. When determining whether there is a &ldquo;reasonable commercial
	purpose&rdquo; of the transaction arrangement, features to be taken into consideration include: whether the main value of the equity
	interest of the relevant offshore enterprise derives from PRC taxable assets; whether the assets of the relevant offshore enterprise
	mainly consists of direct or indirect investment in China or if its income mainly derives from China; whether the offshore enterprise
	and its subsidiaries directly or indirectly holding PRC taxable assets have real commercial nature which is evidenced by their
	actual function and risk exposure; the duration of existence of the business model and organizational structure; the replicability
	of the transaction by direct transfer of PRC taxable assets; and the tax situation of such indirect transfer and applicable tax
	treaties or similar arrangements. In respect of an indirect offshore transfer of assets of a PRC establishment, the resulting gain
	is to be included with the enterprise income tax filing of the PRC establishment or place of business being transferred, and would
	consequently be subject to PRC enterprise income tax at a rate of 25%. Where the underlying transfer relates to the immoveable
	properties located in China or to equity investments in a PRC resident enterprise, which is not related to a PRC establishment
	or place of business of a non-resident enterprise, a PRC enterprise income tax at 10% would apply, subject to available preferential
	tax treatment under applicable tax treaties or similar arrangements, and the payer bears the withholding obligation. Where the
	payer fails to withhold any or sufficient tax, the transferor shall declare and pay such tax to the tax authority by itself within
	the statutory time limit. Late payment of applicable tax will subject the transferor to default interest. Bulletin 7 does not apply
	to transactions of sale of shares by investors through a public stock exchange where such shares were acquired from a transaction
	through a public stock exchange.

	There is uncertainty as to the application
	of Bulletin 7 and the previous rules under Circular 698. Tax authorities may determine that Bulletin 7 is applicable to any offshore
	transaction involving both us and a non-PRC resident enterprise. As a result, both transferors and transferees may be subject to
	obligations to withhold, or make filings regarding, EIT, and one or more of our PRC subsidiaries may need to assist with such filing.
	Furthermore, we and one or more of our non-PRC resident enterprises or PRC subsidiaries may need to spend valuable resources in
	order to comply with Bulletin 7, or to establish that we and our non-PRC resident enterprises should not be taxed under Bulletin
	7. Any such expenditure of valuable resources may have a material and adverse effect on our financial condition and results of

	Circular 142, or SAFE Notice 142, a notice regulating the conversion by a foreign invested company of foreign currency into Renminbi
	by restricting how the converted Renminbi may be used. The notice requires that the registered capital of a foreign-invested company,
	which is settled in Renminbi and converted from foreign currencies, may only be used for purposes within that company&rsquo;s business
	scope approved by the applicable governmental authority and may not be used for equity investments within the PRC. In addition,

	in any case be used to repay Renminbi loans if the proceeds of such loans have not been used. Violations of SAFE Notice 142 may

	Our business could be adversely affected
	by the effects of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, or SARS, avian flu, or another epidemic or outbreak. In 2005 and 2006, there
	were reports on occurrences of avian flu in various parts of China, including a few confirmed human cases. During 2007 and early
	2008, there were reports of outbreaks of a highly pathogenic avian flu, caused by the H5N1 virus, in certain regions of Asia and
	Europe. In 2009 and 2010, there were reports on occurrences of swine flu, caused by the H1N1 virus, in Mexico, the United States,
	China and certain other countries and regions around the world. In 2013, there were reports on occurrences of avian flu, caused
	by the H7N9 virus, in certain regions in China. An outbreak of avian flu or swine flu in the human population could result in a
	widespread health crisis that could adversely affect the economies and financial markets of many countries, particularly in Asia.
	Additionally, any recurrence of SARS, a highly contagious form of atypical pneumonia, similar to the occurrence in 2003 which affected
	China, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Singapore, Vietnam and certain other countries, also would have similar adverse effects. The current
	Ebola virus outbreak in West Africa that began in March 2014 is the largest and most complex Ebola outbreak since the Ebola virus
	was first discovered in 1976. This Ebola outbreak was declared a Public Health Emergency of International Concern by the World
	Health Organization on August 8, 2014. These outbreaks of contagious diseases, and other adverse public health developments in
	China, would have a material and adverse effect on our business operations. These could include restrictions on our ability to
	travel or to ship our products outside of China, as well as cause temporary closure of our manufacturing facilities. Such closures
	or travel or shipment restrictions would severely disrupt our business operations and adversely affect our financial condition
	and results of operations. We have not adopted any written preventive measures or contingency plans to combat any future outbreak
	of avian flu, swine flu, SARS or any other epidemic.

	The market price for our ADSs has been
	and will continue to be highly volatile. Since the ADSs became listed on the NYSE on June 8, 2007, the trading prices of the ADSs,
	after retroactively adjusted to reflect the current ADS-to-ordinary share ratio of one ADS to ten ordinary shares, had ranged
	from US$3.02 to US$414.0 per ADS. On August 13, 2015, we received a notice from the New York Stock Exchange, or the NYSE, stating
	that we were not in compliance with the NYSE&rsquo;s price criteria for continued listing because, as of August 12, 2015, the
	average closing price of the ADSs was less than $1.00 per ADS over a consecutive 30 trading-day period. Thus, on December 28,
	2015, we announced a plan to change the ratio of ADSs to ordinary shares from a ratio of one (1) ADS to one (1) ordinary shares
	to a ratio of one (1) ADS to ten (10) ordinary shares, which ratio change became effective on December 28, 2015. The corresponding
	effect on the price of the ADSs also took place on December 28, 2015.

	may determine not to distribute such property. We have no obligation to register under Securities Act any ADSs, ordinary shares,

	of the ADSs, ordinary shares, rights or anything else to holders of the ADSs either. This means that you may not receive the distributions

	Our corporate affairs are governed by our
	memorandum and articles of association, the Cayman Islands Companies Law (as amended) and the common law of the Cayman Islands.
	The rights of shareholders to take action against the directors, actions by minority shareholders and the fiduciary responsibilities
	of our directors to us under Cayman Islands law are to a large extent governed by the common law of the Cayman Islands. The common
	law of the Cayman Islands is derived in part from comparatively limited judicial precedent in the Cayman Islands as well as that
	from English common law, which has persuasive, but not binding, authority on a court in the Cayman Islands. The rights of our shareholders
	and the fiduciary responsibilities of our directors under Cayman Islands law are not as clearly established as they would be under
	statutes or judicial precedent in some jurisdictions of the United States. In particular, the Cayman Islands have a body of securities
	laws that is less developed than that of the United States. In addition, some U.S. states, such as Delaware, have bodies of corporate
	law that are more fully developed and judicially interpreted than those of the Cayman Islands. As a result of all of the above,
	shareholders of a Cayman Islands company may have more difficulty in protecting their interests in the face of actions taken by
	management, members of the board of directors or controlling shareholders than they would as shareholders of a company incorporated
	in a jurisdiction of the United States. For example, contrary to the general practice of most corporations incorporated in the
	United States, Cayman Islands law does not require that shareholders approve sales of all or substantially all of a company&rsquo;s
	assets. The limitations described above also will apply to the depositary who is treated as the holder of the shares underlying
	your ADSs.

	and a substantial majority of the assets of these persons are located outside the United States. As a result, it may be difficult

	1998 to 2006, Yingli Group, a PRC company controlled by Mr.&nbsp;Liansheng Miao, and Tianwei Baobian, a PRC listed company, became

	Yingli Green Energy was incorporated on
	August&nbsp;7, 2006 in the Cayman Islands as part of a restructuring of the equity interests in Tianwei Yingli in order to facilitate
	investments by foreign financial investors in Tianwei Yingli and the listing of our shares on an overseas stock market to achieve
	such investors&rsquo; investment goal and exit and liquidity strategies. On August&nbsp;25, 2006, Yingli Green Energy entered into
	a Sino-foreign equity joint venture company contract with Tianwei Baobian pursuant to which, among other things, we granted to Tianwei
	Baobian a right to subscribe for newly issued ordinary shares of us in exchange for all but not part of the equity interest in
	Tianwei Yingli held by Tianwei Baobian. Tianwei Baobian may exercise this subscription right only after certain conditions (as
	described below) are satisfied. On September&nbsp;5, 2006, Yingli Group transferred all of its 51% equity interest in Tianwei Yingli
	to us in a transaction between entities under common control. As a result of such transfer, Tianwei Yingli became our subsidiary.
	For financial statements reporting purposes, Tianwei Yingli is deemed to be our predecessor. Through a series of additional equity
	contributions into Tianwei Yingli, we have increased our holdings to 74.01% of Tianwei Yingli&rsquo;s equity interests.

	facility and we entered into a warrant agreement whereby we issued to ADM Capital 4,125,000 warrants. Each warrant provides for

	average closing price per ADS on the NYSE for the period prior to the issuance of the warrant, subject to customary anti-dilution
	and similar adjustments. In June&nbsp;2009, we and ADM Capital revised the warrant agreement and modified the terms so that (i)&nbsp;the

	The polysilicon blocks are then sliced
	into wafers with wire saws. Thinner wafers enable a more efficient use of polysilicon, and lower the cost per watt of power produced.
	The thickness of our wafers and the diameter of our wires were 180 microns and 120 microns, respectively, as of December&nbsp;31,
	2015. Our wafers are generally available in the size of 156 millimeters x 156 millimeters. Historically at times when we had produced
	an excess amount of wafers as a result of the disparity in our wafer manufacturing capacity and the PV cell capacity, we provided
	excess wafers to third-party toll manufacturers which processed wafers into PV cells and returned the PV cells to us for a processing
	fee under toll manufacturing arrangements. In 2010, we entered into toll manufacturing arrangements with third-party toll manufacturers,
	which accounted for a very small percentage of our total production volume. For the year 2012, 2013, and 2014, we did not have

	amount of RMB1.0 billion when they matured in October 2015. As a measure to reduce our operating cash requirements in 2015
	and 2016, we have contracted with third parties to allow them operate more than half of our polysilicon ingot and wafer
	production facilities. These third parties pay us a monthly fee to operate these production facilities, pay the salaries of
	our staff members employed and utility expenses incurred at such facilities, produce fixed volumes of
	polysilicon ingots and wafers on a monthly basis, and cover all other manner of operating, ancillary, and raw material
	expenses of such production. As part of the arrangement, we agree to purchase all of the wafers so produced by said third
	parties at designated prices, subject to certain adjustments under the relevant agreements. As these third parties would
	provide all the working capital required for production of the polysilicon ingots and wafers, these arrangements effectively
	help us finance our production value chain, reduce our working capital requirements, and increase the utilization of our
	polysilicon ingot and wafer production facilities. Our agreements with these third parties typically have a term of one year.
	We cannot assure you that we will be able to renew these agreements when they expire or that these third parties will not
	breach or early terminate the agreements.

	A PV cell is a device made from a polysilicon
	wafer that converts sunlight into electricity by a process known as the photovoltaic effect. The conversion efficiency of a PV
	cell is the ratio of electrical energy produced by the cell to the energy from sunlight that reaches the cell. The conversion efficiency
	of PV cells is determined to a large extent by the quality of wafers used to produce the PV cells, which is, in turn, determined
	by the mix of different types of polysilicon raw materials used in the ingot casting process.

	Polysilicon Ingots
</I>
	. The quality
	of polysilicon ingots determines, to a large extent, the quality of our final PV products. To produce polysilicon ingots, polysilicon
	is melted in a quartz crucible within a furnace. The melted polysilicon then undergoes a crystal growing process, gradually anneals
	and forms an ingot. To reduce the cost of polysilicon, we use a mix of high-purity polysilicon and lower-purity polysilicon, including
	polysilicon scraps such as the discarded tops and tails of ingots, pot scraps and broken or unused silicon wafers. Our employees
	undertake the labor-intensive process of sorting through the polysilicon feedstock to separate polysilicon that meets our specified
	standards for the production of ingots. The polysilicon feedstock used in the production of multicrystalline polysilicon ingots
	is not required to have the same level of purity as that used to produce monocrystalline silicon ingots. Nonetheless, impurities
	in polysilicon feedstock present a challenge to the production of polysilicon ingots because impurities are difficult to separate
	in the casting process.

	. The silicon wafers undergo

	and create a suede-like structure on the wafer surface, which reduces the PV cell&rsquo;s reflection of sunlight and increases
	the PV cell&rsquo;s absorption of solar energy. Through a diffusion process, we then introduce certain impurities into the silicon
	wafers and form an electrical field within the PV cell. We achieve the electrical isolation between the front and back surfaces
	of the silicon wafer by edge isolation, or removing a very thin layer of silicon around the edge. We then apply an anti-reflection
	coating to the front surface of the wafer to enhance its absorption of sunlight. We screen-print negative and positive metal contacts,
	or electrodes, on the front and back surfaces of the PV cell, respectively, with the front contact in a grid pattern to collect
	the electrical current. Silicon and metal electrodes are then connected through an electrode firing process in a conveyor belt
	furnace at a high temperature. Testing and sorting complete the manufacturing process for PV cells.

	We started our solar project development
	and operation business on a small scale in China in 2012. As of September 2015, we had engaged in the construction of approximately
	600 megawatts of PV projects in China and connected approximately 200 megawatts of them to the grid. However, due to China&rsquo;s
	nationwide delay in allocating subsidies, the long-term operation of large ground-mounted PV stations would require significant
	capital. With due consideration of our cash flow challenges, we decided to suspend new downstream development business in China
	from September 2015 until we regain a healthier financial position. Accordingly, we continued to accelerate the disposition of
	our downstream PV projects in China in order to collect funds related to our downstream business.

	Polysilicon is the most important raw material
	used in our production process. Due to growing global demand for polysilicon, polysilicon prices had increased substantially over
	the past few years until the fourth quarter of 2008. From the fourth quarter of 2008 to the second quarter of 2009, as the result
	of increased polysilicon manufacturing capacity and decreased demand for polysilicon due to the global financial crisis in 2008
	and 2009, the price of polysilicon decreased significantly. Although the polysilicon price rebounded between the third quarter
	of 2010 and first quarter of 2011 due to the recovery of demand for PV products in certain markets, the polysilicon price has decreased
	significantly starting from the second quarter of 2011 as the result of increased polysilicon manufacturing capacity for polysilicon
	and downward price pressure from the decreasing average selling prices of PV modules. In 2012, polysilicon prices continued to
	decline and reached a historical low of approximately US$14 per kilogram in November&nbsp;2012. Partly due to China&rsquo;s anti-dumping
	and anti-subsidy investigations against U.S., South Korean and European polysilicon manufacturers, polysilicon prices rebounded
	slightly since December&nbsp;2012. Since June 2013, polysilicon price has begun to increase and reached approximately US$22 until
	the first half of 2014. From the second half of 2014, polysilicon price has slightly decreased and fluctuated under US$20 per kilogram
	as of May 16, 2016. However, any significant increase in the price for polysilicon in the future would materially and adversely
	affect our profitability and results of operations.

	Historically, we relied on spot market
	purchases to meet a significant portion of our polysilicon needs. In order to secure adequate and timely supplies of polysilicon,
	we are actively seeking to further strengthen our relationships with our polysilicon suppliers and establish strategic relationships
	with them. We have entered into various purchase agreements and memorandums of understanding with local and foreign suppliers,
	including some of the world&rsquo;s major polysilicon suppliers. Supplies under these purchase agreements began to be provided

	Between 2006 and 2010, we entered into
	seven long-term supply contracts with Wacker Chemie AG, or Wacker, a German polysilicon supplier, to provide supplies of polysilicon
	from 2009 through 2013, from 2009 through 2017, from 2010 through 2018, from 2009 through 2011, from 2010 through 2017, from 2011
	through 2013 and from 2011 through 2018, respectively. In addition, in February 2008 we entered into one long-term supply agreement
	with OCI Company Ltd., or OCI, formerly known as DC Chemical, to provide supplies of polysilicon for the period from 2009 through
	2013. From 2009 to 2013, we entered into another two long-term supply contracts with OCI, to provide supplies of polysilicon from
	2011 through 2015 and from 2012 through 2018, respectively. We also entered into a polysilicon supply contract with Daqo New Energy
	Corp., or Daqo, formerly known as Sailing, for supplies of polysilicon from the fourth quarter of 2008 through the end of 2010.
	In August&nbsp;2010, we entered into another polysilicon supply agreement with Daqo for supplies of polysilicon from 2011 through
	2012. In March&nbsp;2011, we entered into a long-term polysilicon supply agreement with Hemlock Semiconductor Pte. Ltd., or Hemlock,
	to provide supplies of polysilicon from 2013 through 2020. In November&nbsp;2011, we and Hemlock agreed to amend this long-term
	supply agreement to purchase polysilicon starting from 2012 through 2020 instead of 2013 through 2020.&nbsp;In October&nbsp;2013,
	we also entered into an agreement with a certain vendor to amend our long-term supply contracts with the vendor to include a price
	adjustment mechanism that allows the vendor and us to renegotiate the purchase price on a quarterly basis within a specified price
	range based on prices then prevailing in the open market. Due to fluctuations in polysilicon prices, we successfully negotiated
	and executed amendments for current purchases on a quarterly or monthly basis with some of these vendors that amended certain commercial
	terms such as total contract quantity, advance payment arrangements and unit prices for the relevant quarter or month several times
	in 2013, 2014 and 2015.See &ldquo;Item 3.D. Risk Factors &mdash; Risks Related to Us and the PV Industry &mdash; Our polysilicon
	cost may be higher than the market level as a result of our long-term polysilicon purchase commitment with fixed prices, and we

	to overseas customers through our overseas subsidiaries and regional headquarters located in our major markets, such as the United
	States, Japan, Germany,&nbsp;France, Spain, Turkey, South Africa, Brazil, Chile, Australia, Singapore and Mexico. Before September&nbsp;30,
	2011, our PV modules were typically sold with a two- or five-year limited warranty for defects in materials and workmanship, and
	a 10-year and 25-year warranty against declines of more than 10% and 20% of initial power generation capacity, respectively. From
	October 1, 2011, we implemented a new and improved warranty term that guarantees 91.2% of nominal power output for 10 years, and
	80.7% of nominal power output for a period of 25 years for multicrystalline PV modules and 98.0% of nominal power output for the
	first year, 92.0% of nominal power output for 10 years, and 82.0% of nominal power output for a period of 25 years for monocrystalline
	Panda PV modules. From September 1, 2014, we updated our warranty terms to guarantee 91.2% of nominal power output for 10 years
	and 80.7% of nominal power output for 25 years for multicrystalline PV modules, and to guarantee 98.0% of nominal power output
	for the first year, 92.2% of nominal power output for 10 years, and 82.4% of nominal power output for 25 years for monocrystalline
	Panda PV modules. In addition, based on customers&rsquo; specific requirements, we also provide our multicrystalline PV modules
	with a linear-based warranty which guarantees each year of power output during the twenty-five-year warranty period. In 2012, we
	entered into a module performance warranty insurance agreement with Munich Re&rsquo;s specialty primary insurers. According to
	the agreement, both of us will provide additional economic security for large-scale commercial and utility project developers,
	investors and debt providers during the period from October&nbsp;1, 2012 to September&nbsp;30, 2013. In December&nbsp;2013, we
	entered into a similar module performance warranty insurance agreement with another insurance company for the same scope of beneficiaries
	for the period from January&nbsp;1, 2014 to December&nbsp;31, 2014, and renewed the agreement in March 2015 and January 2016 for
	the period from January&nbsp;1, 2015 to December&nbsp;31, 2015 and from January 1, 2016 to December 31, 2016, respectively. In
	2014, we launched the new comprehensive warranty, and the PV modules achieved PID resistance identification according to the IEC
	standard. Nevertheless, we bear the risk of warranty claims long after we have sold our products and recognized revenues. Because
	our products have only been in use for a relatively short period of time, our assumptions regarding the durability and reliability
	of our products may not be accurate, and because our products have relatively long warranty periods, we cannot assure you that
	the amount of accrued warranty provided by us for our products will be adequate in light of the actual performance of our products.
	See &ldquo;Item 3.D. Risk Factors &mdash; Risks Related to Us and the PV Industry &mdash; Unsatisfactory performance of or defects

	The PV market is intensely competitive
	and rapidly evolving. The supply of PV products has rapidly increased due to the growth of actual and forecasted demand for PV
	products and relatively low barriers to entry. The weakened demand for PV modules due to weakened macroeconomic conditions and
	tightened credit for PV project financing, combined with the increased supply of PV modules in recent years, have caused the price
	of PV modules to decline since the beginning of the fourth quarter of 2008. Since the last quarter of 2012, the price of PV modules
	has remained relatively stable primarily due to the shake-out of certain uncompetitive production capacity and increased demand
	worldwide. Demand started to increase from the second half of 2013 and the prices of PV modules slightly increased at the same
	time. However, prices of PV modules slightly declined again in 2015. We expect that the prices of PV products, including PV modules,
	may continue to slightly decrease due to continued reductions in the cost of their manufacture.&nbsp;If we fail to attract and
	retain customers in our target markets for our current and future core products, namely PV modules and PV systems, we will be unable
	to increase our revenues and market share.

	We may also face competition from new entrants

	crystalline polysilicon technologies which we currently use. Widespread adoption of any of these technologies could result in a
	rapid decline in demand for our products and a resulting decrease in our revenues if we fail to adopt such technologies. In addition,
	some of our competitors have become, or are becoming, vertically integrated in the PV industry value chain, as we already have

	period from its effective date for enterprises that were established before the promulgation date of the EIT Law and which enterprises
	were entitled to preferential tax rates and treatments under the then effective tax laws or regulations. On December&nbsp;26, 2007,

	the EIT Law, entities that qualify as &ldquo;high and new technology enterprises strongly supported by the state&rdquo; are entitled
	to a preferential enterprise income tax rate of 15%. The Ministry of Science and Technology, the MOF and the State Administration
	of Taxation jointly issued the Administrative Regulations on the Recognition of High and New Technology Enterprises on January
	29, 2016 to replace the previous regulations issued on April 24, 2008, but have yet to issue new guidelines to replace the Guidelines

	Under the effective tax laws and regulations,
	Tianwei Yingli, as a foreign invested enterprise engaged primarily in manufacturing and having been in operation for more than
	ten years, was entitled to a two-year exemption from the enterprise income tax from its first profit-making year following its
	conversion into a Sino-foreign equity joint venture company, which exemption specifically was effective in 2007 and 2008, and a
	50% reduction in the subsequent three years, from 2009 to 2011. Accordingly, Tianwei Yingli was subject to enterprise income tax
	at a rate of 12.5% from 2009 to 2011. In August&nbsp;2011, Tianwei Yingli renewed the certificate for its status as a &ldquo;High
	and New Technology Enterprise&rdquo; and extended the preferential income tax period for another three years starting from 2011.&nbsp;As
	a result, Tianwei Yingli was entitled to a preferential EIT rate of 15% for 2012 and 2013.&nbsp;In August 2014, Tianwei Yingli
	renewed the certificate for its status as a &ldquo;High and New Technology Enterprise&rdquo; and extended the preferential income
	tax period for another three years starting from 2014. As a result, Tianwei Yingli is entitled to a preferential EIT rate of 15%
	from 2014 to 2016. Yingli China was established in October&nbsp;2007 and was originally recognized by the Chinese government as
	a &ldquo;High and New Technology Enterprise&rdquo; under the EIT Law in December&nbsp;2008.&nbsp;In August&nbsp;2011, Yingli China

	Enterprise&rdquo; and extended the preferential income tax period for another three years starting from 2014. As a result, Yingli
	China is entitled to a preferential EIT rate of 15% from 2014 to 2016. Hainan Yingli, located in the Hainan special economic zone,
	was established in September 2009 and was originally recognized by the Chinese government as a &ldquo;High and New Technology Enterprise&rdquo;
	under the EIT Law in September 2011. Therefore, Hainan Yingli was entitled to a two-year tax exemption from the enterprise income
	tax for the first two years of its operation, and a 50% reduction in the subsequent three years upon generating any operational
	revenues. Hainan Yingli elected to defer the commencement of the abovementioned tax holidays until January 1, 2011. Therefore,
	Hainan Yingli is entitled to an exemption from EIT from 2011 to 2012 and a preferential EIT rate of 12.5% from 2013 to 2015. Tianjin
	Yingli, located in Tianjin, was established in March 2011 and was originally recognized by the Chinese government as a &ldquo;High

	rate of 15% from 2013 to 2015. Lixian Yingli, located in Lixian, Hebei Province, was established in June 2010 and was originally
	recognized by the Chinese government as a &ldquo;High and New Technology Enterprise&rdquo; under the EIT Law in July 2013. Therefore,
	Lixian Yingli is entitled to a preferential EIT rate of 15% from 2013 to 2015. Hengshui Yingli, located in Hengshui, Hebei Province,
	was established in April 2011 and was originally recognized by the Chinese government as a &ldquo;High and New Technology Enterprise&rdquo;

	The EIT Law also specifies that enterprises
	established outside of China whose &ldquo;de facto management bodies&rdquo; are located in China are considered &ldquo;resident
	enterprises&rdquo; and generally are subject to enterprise income tax on their worldwide income at the uniform 25% rate. Under
	the implementation rules&nbsp;for the EIT Law issued by the State Council, a &ldquo;de facto management body&rdquo; is defined
	as a body that has substantial and overall management and control over the manufacturing and business operations, personnel, accounting,
	properties and other factors of an enterprise. On April&nbsp;22, 2009, the State Administration of Taxation promulgated the Notice
	Regarding Determination of Chinese-Controlled Overseas Incorporated Enterprises as PRC Tax Resident Enterprises on the Basis of
	De Facto Management Bodies, or SAT Circular 82, which sets out criteria for determining whether &ldquo;de facto management bodies&rdquo;
	are located in China for overseas incorporated, domestically controlled enterprises. However, as this circular only applies to
	enterprises incorporated under laws of foreign countries or regions that are controlled by PRC enterprises or groups of PRC enterprises,
	it remains unclear how the tax authorities will determine the location of &ldquo;de facto management bodies&rdquo; for overseas
	incorporated enterprises that are controlled by individual PRC residents like us and some of our subsidiaries. Therefore, although
	substantially all of our management is currently located in the PRC, it remains unclear whether the PRC tax authorities would require
	or permit our overseas registered entities to be treated as PRC resident enterprises. If the PRC tax authorities determine that
	Yingli Green Energy and some of our subsidiaries, such as Yingli International, Yingli Capital, Yingli Hong Kong, Cyber Power and
	Cyber Lighting, are PRC resident enterprises, we and such subsidiaries may be subject to enterprise income tax as to our global
	income at the 25% rate. See &ldquo;Item 3.D. Risk Factors &mdash; Risks Related to Doing Business in China &mdash; We and some
	of our subsidiaries may be deemed resident enterprises under the EIT Law and be subject to PRC taxation as to our worldwide income&rdquo;.

	On February 3, 2015, the State Administration
	of Taxation issued the Bulletin on Issues of Enterprise Income Tax on Indirect Transfers of Assets by Non-PRC Resident Enterprises,
	or Bulletin 7, which replaced or supplemented previous rules under the Notice on Strengthening Administration of Enterprise Income
	Tax for Share Transfers by Non-PRC Resident Enterprises, or Circular 698, issued by the State Administration of Taxation, on December
	10, 2009. Pursuant to this Bulletin, an &ldquo;indirect transfer&rdquo; of assets, including equity interests in a PRC resident
	enterprise, by non-PRC resident enterprises may be re-characterized and treated as a direct transfer of PRC taxable assets, if
	such arrangement does not have a reasonable commercial purpose and was established for the purpose of avoiding payment of PRC enterprise
	income tax. As a result, gains derived from such indirect transfer may be subject to PRC enterprise income tax. According to Bulletin
	7, &ldquo;PRC taxable assets&rdquo; include assets attributed to an establishment in China, immoveable properties located in China,
	and equity investments in PRC resident enterprises, in respect of which gains from their transfer by a direct holder, being a non-PRC
	resident enterprise, would be subject to PRC enterprise income taxes. When determining whether there is a &ldquo;reasonable commercial
	purpose&rdquo; of the transaction arrangement, features to be taken into consideration include: whether the main value of the equity
	interest of the relevant offshore enterprise derives from PRC taxable assets; whether the assets of the relevant offshore enterprise
	mainly consists of direct or indirect investment in China or if its income mainly derives from China; whether the offshore enterprise
	and its subsidiaries directly or indirectly holding PRC taxable assets have real commercial nature which is evidenced by their
	actual function and risk exposure; the duration of existence of the business model and organizational structure; the replicability
	of the transaction by direct transfer of PRC taxable assets; and the tax situation of such indirect transfer and applicable tax
	treaties or similar arrangements. In respect of an indirect offshore transfer of assets of a PRC establishment, the resulting gain
	is to be included with the enterprise income tax filing of the PRC establishment or place of business being transferred, and would
	consequently be subject to PRC enterprise income tax at a rate of 25%. Where the underlying transfer relates to the immoveable
	properties located in China or to equity investments in a PRC resident enterprise, which is not related to a PRC establishment
	or place of business of a non-resident enterprise, a PRC enterprise income tax at 10% would apply, subject to available preferential
	tax treatment under applicable tax treaties or similar arrangements, and the payer bears the withholding obligation. Where the
	payer fails to withhold any or sufficient tax, the transferor shall declare and pay such the tax to the tax authority by itself
	within the statutory time limit. Late payment of applicable tax will subject the transferor to default interest. Bulletin 7 does
	not apply to transactions of sale of shares by investors through a public stock exchange where such shares were acquired from a
	transaction through a public stock exchange.

	SAFE promulgated SAFE Circular 37, on July
	4, 2014, which replaced SAFE Notice 75 promulgated by SAFE on October 21, 2005. SAFE Circular 37 requires PRC residents to register
	with local branches of SAFE in connection with their direct establishment or indirect control of an offshore entity, for the purpose
	of overseas investment and financing, with such PRC residents&rsquo; legally owned assets or equity interests in domestic enterprises
	or offshore assets or interests, referred to in SAFE Circular 37 as a special purpose vehicle. SAFE Circular 37 further requires
	amendment to the registration in the event of any significant changes with respect to the special purpose vehicle, such as increase
	or decrease of capital contributed by PRC individuals, share transfer or exchange, merger, division or other material event. In
	the event that a PRC shareholder holding interests in a special purpose vehicle fails to fulfill the required SAFE registration,
	the PRC subsidiaries of that special purpose vehicle may be prohibited from making profit distributions to the offshore parent
	and from carrying out subsequent cross-border foreign exchange activities, and the special purpose vehicle may be restricted in
	its ability to contribute additional capital into its PRC subsidiary. Furthermore, failure to comply with the various SAFE registration
	requirements described above could result in liability under PRC law for evasion of foreign exchange controls. On February 13,
	2015, SAFE released the Notice on Further Simplifying and Improving Policies for the Foreign Exchange Administration of Direct
	Investment, or SAFE Circular 13, which has taken effective from June 1, 2015. According to this notice, local banks will examine

	On August&nbsp;29, 2008, SAFE promulgated
	Circular 142, or SAFE Notice 142, a notice regulating the conversion by a foreign invested company of foreign currency into Renminbi
	by restricting how the converted Renminbi may be used. The notice requires that the registered capital of a foreign-invested company
	settled in Renminbi converted from foreign currencies may only be used for purposes within the business scope approved by the applicable
	governmental authority and may not be used for equity investments within the PRC. In addition, SAFE strengthened its oversight
	of the flow and use of the registered capital of a foreign-invested company settled in Renminbi converted from foreign currencies.
	The use of such Renminbi capital may not be changed without SAFE&rsquo;s approval, and may not in any case be used to repay Renminbi
	loans if the proceeds of such loans have not been used. Violations of SAFE Notice 142 will result in severe penalties, such as
	heavy fines. On November&nbsp;19, 2012, SAFE promulgated Circular 59, which came into force on December&nbsp;17, 2012. Circular
	59 further relaxes the foreign exchange controls over inbound and outbound investments by PRC companies and simplifies the current
	administrative system, especially in foreign currency capital settlement and foreign exchange registration procedures of foreign-invested

	The SAFE Notice 142 has been replaced by
	the SAFE Notice 19, which was issued by SAFE on March&nbsp;30, 2015 and became effective on June&nbsp;1, 2015. According to the
	SAFE Notice 19, a foreign invested enterprise is allowed to settle its foreign exchange capital on a discretionary basis according
	to the actual needs of their business operation and provides the procedures for foreign invested enterprises to use Renminbi converted
	from foreign-denominated registered capital of a foreign-invested enterprise for equity investment. Nevertheless, the SAFE Notice

	In December&nbsp;2006, the People&rsquo;s
	Bank of China promulgated the Administrative Measures on Individual Person Foreign Exchange, or the PBOC Regulation, setting forth
	the respective requirements for foreign exchange transactions by individuals (both PRC or non-PRC citizens) under current accounts
	and capital accounts. In January&nbsp;2007, SAFE issued the implementation rules&nbsp;for the PBOC Regulation, which, among other
	things, specified the approval requirement for certain capital account transactions such as a PRC citizen&rsquo;s participation
	in the employee stock ownership plan or stock options plan of an overseas listed company. Consequently, in February&nbsp;2012,
	SAFE promulgated the Share Option Rules, under which PRC citizens or residents habitually residing in the PRC continuously for
	over one year, who are granted shares or share options by an overseas-listed company according to its employee share option or
	share incentive plan are required, through the PRC subsidiary of such overseas-listed company or qualified PRC agents, to register
	with SAFE and complete certain other procedures related to the shareholding plan, share option plan or other similar share incentive
	plans.&nbsp;Concurrent with the registration with SAFE, the PRC subsidiary or the qualified PRC agent shall obtain an approval
	for an annual allowance of foreign exchange in connection with the exercise of any shareholding or share option as well as an approval
	to open a special foreign exchange account at a PRC domestic bank to hold the funds required in connection with such exercise of
	the share purchase or share option, returned principal or profits upon sale of shares, dividends issued on the stock and any other
	income or expenditures approved by SAFE. Currently, participating PRC residents&rsquo; foreign exchange income received from the
	sale of shares and dividends distributed by the overseas-listed company must be fully remitted into the domestic foreign currency
	account before such income is distributed to such participants.&nbsp;In addition, the PRC agents are required to amend or deregister
	the registrations with SAFE in case of any material change in, or termination of, the share incentive plans, within the time periods
	provided by the Share Option Rules.

	Our business and revenue growth depend
	on market demand for PV products. Although solar power technology has been used for several decades, the PV market grew significantly
	only in the past decade. According to EnergyTrend, solar energy division of TrendForce, global PV market demand in 2015 increased
	by more than 20% year over year to 56 gigawatts, and is expected to reach to 66 gigawatts in 2017.

</B>
	This scenario
	assumes the continuation or introduction of adequate support mechanisms, accompanied by a strong political will to consider PV
	as a major power source in the coming years. However, demand for our PV products also depends on the general economic conditions
	in our target markets. Since the second half of 2008, economies around the world, including those in our target markets, have experienced
	a period of slow economic growth as compared to prior years. Partly as a result of these weakened worldwide macroeconomic conditions,
	the growth in demand for PV modules declined significantly since the fourth quarter of 2008. Starting from the second quarter of
	2009, the macroeconomic environment began to improve, which led to an increase in demand for our products. The growth of demand
	for our products from some markets slowed down in the first quarter of 2011 until the first quarter of 2013, primarily caused by
	the adjustment of subsidies and economic incentives for PV installations. However, starting in 2014, the growth of demand for the
	products in our target markets, such as China and Japan began to increase and kept increasing at a remarkable rate due to strong
	market demand and government supports with favorable policies. As the global solar industry expands and innovative new PV applications
	are adopted, we expect demand to grow swiftly for high-performing, high-efficiency and cost-effective monocrystalline technology
	and PV solutions.

	We believe that the near-term growth of
	the market for PV products depends in part on the availability and size of government subsidies and economic incentives. Today,
	the cost of solar power substantially exceeds the cost of electrical power generated from conventional fossil fuels such as coal

	China, Greece,&nbsp;Israel, South Africa, the United Kingdom,&nbsp;India, Australia, Thailand, Singapore, Japan, Czech Republic,
	Brazil, Peru, Mexico, Chile and Saudi Arabia, have provided subsidies and economic incentives for the use of renewable energy such

	have been in the form of capital cost rebates, feed-in tariffs, tax credits, net metering and other incentives to end-users, distributors,

	PV systems projects generally require significant

	For example, the average selling price of our PV modules decreased significantly from the fourth quarter of 2008 to the second
	quarter of 2009, partly due to tighter credit for PV system project financing as a result of continued adverse conditions in the
	credit market. In addition, rising interest rates could render existing financings more expensive, as well as serve to hinder potential

	In order to take advantage of expected

	2002 with initial annual manufacturing capacity of three megawatts, polysilicon ingots and wafers in October 2003 with initial
	annual manufacturing capacity of six megawatts, and PV cells in March 2004 with initial annual manufacturing capacity of three

	utilization of our production capacity led to an increase in our unit manufacturing cost and to decreases in our own PV module
	shipments and total net revenues. It also triggered impairment events and we recognized a non-cash impairment charge on our long-lived

	Weakened demand for PV modules due to weakened

	in the second half of 2009. However, decreasing costs of raw materials continued to exert downward pressure on the selling prices
	of PV modules. The average selling prices in 2010 declined during the first, second and third quarters, and slightly bounced back
	in the fourth quarter of 2010, which was primarily attributable to robust market demand, broader recognition of our brand&rsquo;s
	quality and diversified customer base. The average selling price in 2011 declined moderately in the first and second quarter, declined
	sharply in the third quarter and continued to drop in the fourth quarter, which was primarily due to reduced government subsidies
	and increased supplies of PV&nbsp;products. The average selling price of our PV modules in the first three quarters of 2014 remained
	at levels similar to those in 2013, but declined slightly in the fourth quarter of 2014 due to adjustments to the composition of

	Polysilicon is the most important raw material
	used in our manufacturing process. Until the third quarter of 2008, an industry-wide shortage of polysilicon coupled with rapidly
	growing demand from the solar power industry caused rapid increases in polysilicon prices. However, during the fourth quarter of
	2008 and the first half of 2009, polysilicon prices declined continuously as a result of significant new manufacturing capacity
	coming on line and falling demand for solar power products and semiconductor devices resulting from the global financial crisis
	and adverse conditions in the credit market. From the third quarter of 2010, polysilicon prices rebounded due to a recovery in
	demand for PV products in major markets. From the second quarter of 2011, polysilicon prices have decreased significantly as a
	result of increased polysilicon manufacturing capacity across the industry and the downward price pressure exerted by the decreasing
	average selling price of PV modules. In 2012, polysilicon prices continued to decline and reached a historical low of approximately
	US$14 per kilogram in November&nbsp;2012. Partly due to China&rsquo;s anti-dumping and anti-subsidy investigations of United States,
	South Korean and European manufacturers of polysilicon, polysilicon prices rebounded slightly from December&nbsp;2012. Since June
	2013, polysilicon price has begun to increase and reached approximately US$20 per kilogram until the first half of 2014. From the
	second half of 2014, polysilicon price has slightly decreased and fluctuated under US$20 per kilogram as of May 16, 2016.&nbsp;

	Historically, we relied on spot market
	purchases to meet a significant portion of our polysilicon needs. In order to secure an adequate and timely supply of polysilicon,
	in the past we also entered into various purchase agreements and memorandums of understanding with local and foreign suppliers,
	including some of the world&rsquo;s major polysilicon suppliers. Supplies under these purchase agreements started in early 2009.
	In response to the significant decrease in polysilicon prices since the fourth quarter of 2008, we have renegotiated, and are still
	negotiating, with our polysilicon suppliers to reduce the purchase price for a substantial amount of polysilicon supplied under
	certain of our polysilicon supply contracts. However, the purchase prices specified in certain of our long-term polysilicon supply
	contracts have been higher than the actual polysilicon prices prevailing in the market, which have continuously declined. In 2011,
	as a result of lower polysilicon prices we recognized a total non-cash provision of RMB851.7 million on inventory purchase commitments
	under our long-term polysilicon supply contracts with certain supplier. We did not recognize any such provision in 2012 and 2014.
	In 2013 and 2015, we recognized incremental provisions of RMB393.0 million and RMB77.7 million, respectively, on inventory purchase
	commitments under our long-term polysilicon supply contracts as a result of our re-assessment of the commitments under those contracts,
	our performance of and negotiations with our suppliers with respect to those contracts, and based on the then-current market price
	of polysilicon. Our management has been negotiating with our suppliers on adjusting the prices under these long-term contracts.
	These negotiations may result in new commercial terms under the contracts. However, if the circumstances upon which the new commercial
	terms were negotiated should undergo a material change, the commercial terms would be adjusted accordingly to reflect conditions
	then prevailing in the open market. If the effective polysilicon prices under our long-term supply contracts remains higher than
	prevailing market prices, we may incur higher polysilicon costs relative to other competitors who purchase their polysilicon from
	the spot market. On the other hand, we cannot assure you that we will be able to secure sufficient quantities of polysilicon to
	meet the requirements of our existing production capacity or to support any future expansion of our manufacturing capacity. See
	&ldquo;Item 3.D. Risk Factors &mdash; Risks Related to Us and the PV Industry &mdash; Our polysilicon costs may be higher than
	those of other market players due to our long-term commitment to purchase polysilicon at fixed prices, and we have failed to perform

	supplies of polysilicon from 2011 through 2015 and from 2012 through 2018, respectively. We also entered into a polysilicon supply
	contract with Daqo to provide supplies of polysilicon from the fourth quarter of 2008 through the end of 2010. In August 2010,
	we entered into another polysilicon supply agreement with Daqo to provide supplies of polysilicon from 2011 through 2012. In March&nbsp;2011,
	we entered into a long-term polysilicon supply contract with Hemlock to provide supplies of polysilicon from 2013 through 2020.
	In November&nbsp;2011, we entered into an amendment to this long-term supply contract with Hemlock to purchase polysilicon starting
	from 2012 through 2020 instead of 2013 through 2020. In October&nbsp;2013, we also entered into an agreement with a certain vendor
	to amend our long-term supply contracts with the vendor to include a price adjustment mechanism that allows the vendor and us to
	renegotiate the purchase price on a quarterly basis within a specified price range based on prices then prevailing in the open
	market. Due to fluctuations in polysilicon prices, we successfully negotiated and executed amendments for current purchases on
	a quarterly or monthly basis with some of these vendors that amended certain commercial terms such as total contract quantity,
	advance payment arrangements and unit prices for the relevant quarter or month several times in 2013, 2014 and 2015.

	We believe that our vertically integrated
	business model offers us several advantages, particularly in areas of cost reduction and quality control, over our competitors
	that depend on third parties to source core product components. First, the vertical integration enables us to capture margins at
	every stage of the PV product value chain in which we are engaged. Second, by streamlining our manufacturing processes, we can
	reduce production costs and costs associated with toll manufacturing, packaging and transportation as well as breakage losses that
	occur during shipment between various production locations associated with toll manufacturing arrangements. Third, we control operations
	at substantially all stages of the PV value chain, including research and development, which enables us to monitor more closely
	the quality of our PV products from start to finish, and design and streamline our manufacturing processes in a way that enables
	us to leverage our technologies more efficiently and reduce costs at each stage of the manufacturing process. We believe that the
	synergies resulting from our vertically integrated business model have enabled us to reduce the quantity of polysilicon that we
	use to make PV modules, improve the conversion efficiency of our PV cells and reduce the lead time needed to fulfill the orders
	of our customers.

	We export a substantial amount of our products
	to Europe. Our sales to European countries accounted for over 40% of our total net revenues in 2012, compared to approximately
	30% in 2013. On September&nbsp;5 and November&nbsp;8, 2012, respectively, the European Union initiated anti-dumping and anti-subsidy
	investigations into crystalline silicon photovoltaic, or CSPV wafers, cells, and modules from China. On June&nbsp;4, 2013, the
	European Commission issued its provisional anti-dumping determination and on August&nbsp;2, 2013, the European Commission accepted
	an undertaking, or the Undertaking, made by a group of Chinese PV products exporters (including us) jointly with the China Chamber
	of Commerce for Import and Export of Machinery and Electronic Products, or CCCME. Pursuant to the Undertaking, the Chinese exporters
	will limit their exports of solar panels to the EU and set prices above a minimum price, in exchange for the EU agreeing to forgo
	the imposition of anti-dumping duties on these solar panels from China. CCCME is responsible for allocating the quota among these
	exporters, and we have been allocated a portion of the quota. On December&nbsp;5, 2013, the Council of the European Union adopted
	the final findings of the European Commission and imposed anti-dumping and anti-subsidy duties on CSPV modules and key components
	(i.e. cells) originating in or consigned from PRC. Wafers were excluded from the product scope. The anti-dumping duty rates ranged
	from 27.3% to 64.9%, while the anti-subsidy duty rates ranged from 0% to 11.5%. The rates applicable to us are 35.5% and 6.3%,
	respectively. The definitive duties will be imposed for a two-year period starting from December&nbsp;6, 2013. At the same time,
	the Council of the European Union also confirmed the European Commission&rsquo;s acceptance of the Undertaking. While we are exempted
	from paying any anti-dumping and anti-subsidy duties to the EU starting from August&nbsp;6, 2013, the increased selling price and
	the reduced consumption on the European market under the Undertaking may bring significant uncertainties to our business in the
	European market. For example, increased price for our modules sold in EU has made returns for some ground-mounted solar projects
	of our customers less attractive and demand in large-utility projects have declined in Europe compared with the period before the
	effectiveness of the Undertaking. We also face competitions from modules manufactured in third countries at a lower price than
	ours. In addition, if we breach or withdraw from the Undertaking, or the European Commission withdraws its acceptance of the Undertaking,
	the anti-dumping and anti-subsidy duties will automatically apply to us. Thus, there can be no assurance that our entry into and
	performance of the Undertaking will eliminate potential material and adverse effects of anti-dumping and anti-subsidy duties on
	our business in Europe and our results of operations.

	We also export a substantial amount of
	our products to the United States. On November&nbsp;7, 2012, the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) determined that CSPV
	modules produced from Chinese cells are materially injuring the U.S. CSPV cells and modules industry. The U.S. Department of Commerce,
	or the DOC, issued its final determinations on the rates of the anti-dumping, or AD, and countervailing duties, or CVD, on October&nbsp;10,
	2012, which became effective upon issuance of the final AD and CVD orders in early December&nbsp;2012. As a result of such final
	determinations, we, as a voluntary respondent, are subject to an average aggregated AD/CVD rate of 29.18%. However, this average
	aggregated AD/CVD rate might be subject to change due to an administrative review process initiated by DOC in early 2014.

	Before September&nbsp;30, 2011, our PV modules were
	typically sold with a two- or five-year limited warranty for defects in materials and workmanship, and a 10-year and 25-year warranty
	guaranteeing 90% and 80% of initial power generation capacity, respectively. From October&nbsp;1, 2011, we implemented a new and
	improved warranty term that guarantees 91.2% of nominal power output for 10 years and 80.7% of nominal power output for a period
	of 25 years for multicrystalline PV modules, and 98.0% of nominal power output for the first year, 92.0% of nominal power output
	for 10 years, and 82.0% of nominal power output for a period of 25 years for monocrystalline Panda PV modules. In addition, based
	on customers&rsquo; specific requirements, we also provide our multicrystalline PV modules with a linear-based warranty, which
	guarantees each year&rsquo;s power output during the twenty-five-year warranty period. In December&nbsp;2013, we entered into a
	similar module performance warranty insurance agreement with another insurance company for the same scope of beneficiaries during
	the period from January&nbsp;1, 2014 to December&nbsp;31, 2014. In March 2015 and January 2016, we renewed the agreement for the
	same scope of beneficiaries for 2015 and 2016 respectively. These warranties require us to fix or replace the defective products.
	Taking into account estimated product failure rates, the costs of repairing and/or replacing failed products, and other costs associated
	with repairing and/or replacing such failed products, we currently accrue the equivalent of 1% of gross revenues for warranty obligations.
	In 2015, we recorded warranty expenses of RMB84.5 million (US$13.0 million).

	In
	2011, we recognized a provision of RMB851.7 million for our inventory purchase commitments under our long-term polysilicon
	supply contracts as a result of the continuing decline in the purchase price for polysilicon prevailing in the open market.
	No such provision was made in 2012. In 2013, we recognized provisions of RMB393.0 for inventory purchase commitments under
	our long-term polysilicon supply contracts as a result of our
	having re-assessed the purchase commitments under those supply contracts based on then-current market prices for polysilicon
	and the status of our performance of, and negotiations with our suppliers under, the contracts. These negotiations may
	result in
	new commercial terms under the contracts. However, if the circumstances upon which the new commercial terms were
	negotiated should undergo a material change, the commercial terms would be adjusted accordingly to reflect conditions then
	prevailing in the open market. In 2015, we did not recognize additional contingency losses for inventory firm purchase
	commitment. However, due to significant fluctuation in the foreign exchange rates between Renminbi and U.S. dollars and
	given that
	the
	inventory purchase commitment is denominated in U.S. dollars, which is different from the functional currency of our related
	subsidiaries, we recognized a foreign exchange re-measurement loss of RMB 77.7 million. We determined that such
	provision was not needed in 2014 since the foreign exchange rate was stable and the impact caused by the foreign exchange
	rate fluctuation was immaterial.

	On March&nbsp;16, 2007, the National People&rsquo;s
	Congress passed the EIT Law, which replaces the FIE Income Tax Law and adopts a uniform income tax rate of 25% for most domestic
	enterprises and foreign investment enterprises. The EIT Law became effective on January&nbsp;1, 2008. The EIT Law provides a five-year
	transition period from its effective date for enterprises that were established before the promulgation date of the EIT Law and
	which enterprises were entitled to preferential tax rates and treatments under then-effective tax laws or regulations. On December&nbsp;26,
	2007, the PRC government issued detailed implementation rules&nbsp;regarding the transitional preferential policies. Furthermore,
	under the EIT Law, entities that qualify as &ldquo;high and new technology enterprises strongly supported by the state&rdquo; are
	entitled to a preferential enterprise income tax rate of 15%. The Ministry of Science and Technology, the MOF and the State Administration
	of Taxation jointly issued the Administrative Regulations on the Recognition of High and New Technology Enterprises on April&nbsp;14,
	2008 and the Guidelines for the Recognition of High and New Technology Enterprises issued on July&nbsp;8, 2008. Under the EIT Law
	and the various implementation rules, Tianwei Yingli enjoyed its unexpired tax holiday, which was applied to the new income tax
	rate of 25%, resulting in a tax rate of 0% for 2008, and 12.5% for 2009 to 2011. In August&nbsp;2011, Tianwei Yingli renewed its
	certificate as a &ldquo;High and New Technology Enterprise&rdquo; and extended the preferential income tax period for another three
	years starting from 2011. As a result, Tianwei Yingli was entitled to a preferential EIT rate of 15% from 2012 to 2013. Yingli
	China was established in October&nbsp;2007 and was originally recognized by the Chinese government in December&nbsp;2008 as a &ldquo;High
	and New Technology Enterprise&rdquo;. Thus, the preferential enterprise income tax rate of 15% was applicable to Yingli China from
	2008 to 2010. In August&nbsp;2011, Yingli China renewed its certificate as a &ldquo;High and New Technology Enterprise&rdquo; and
	extended the preferential income tax period for another three years starting from 2011. As a result, Yingli China was entitled
	to the preferential EIT rate of 15% from 2011 to 2013. Hainan Yingli was established in September&nbsp;2009 in Hainan special economic
	zone and was recognized by the Chinese government as a &ldquo;High and New Technology Enterprise&rdquo; under the EIT Law in September&nbsp;2011.
	Therefore, Hainan Yingli was entitled to a two-year tax exemption from the enterprise income tax for the first two years of its
	operation, and to a 50% reduction in the subsequent three years upon generating any operational revenues. Hainan Yingli elected
	to defer the commencement of the above-mentioned tax holidays until January&nbsp;1, 2011. Therefore, Hainan Yingli is entitled
	to an exemption from EIT from 2011 to 2012 and a preferential EIT rate of 12.5% from 2013 to 2015. Yingli Tianjin, located in Tianjin,
	was established in March&nbsp;2011 and was originally recognized by the Chinese government as a &ldquo;High and New Technology
	Enterprise&rdquo; under the EIT Law in July&nbsp;2013. Therefore, Yingli Tianjin is entitled to a preferential EIT rate of 15%
	from 2013 to 2015. Yingli Lixian, located in Lixian, Hebei Province, was established in June&nbsp;2010 and was originally recognized
	by the Chinese government as a &ldquo;High and New Technology Enterprise&rdquo; under the EIT Law in July&nbsp;2013. Therefore,
	Yingli Lixian is entitled to a preferential EIT rate of 15% from 2013 to 2015. Yingli Hengshui, located in Hengshui, Hebei Province,
	was established in April&nbsp;2011 and was originally recognized by the Chinese government as a &ldquo;High and New Technology
	Enterprise&rdquo; under the EIT Law in July&nbsp;2013. Therefore, Yingli Hengshui is entitled to a preferential EIT rate of 15%

	Before September&nbsp;30, 2011, our PV
	modules were typically sold with a two- or five-year limited warranty for defects in materials and workmanship, and a 10-year and
	25-year warranty guaranteeing 90% and 80% of initial power generation capacity, respectively. To remain consistent with industry
	practice, from October&nbsp;1, 2011, we implemented a new and improved warranty term that guarantees 91.2% of nominal power output
	for 10 years, and 80.7% of nominal power output for a period of 25 years for multicrystalline PV modules and 98.0% of nominal power
	output for the first year, 92.0% of nominal power output for 10 years, and 82.0% of nominal power output for a period of 25 years
	for monocrystalline Panda PV modules. From September 1, 2014, we updated our warranty terms to guarantee 91.2% of nominal power
	for 10 years and 80.7% of nominal power output for 25 years for multicrystalline PV modules, and to guarantee 98.0% of nominal
	power output for the first year, 92.2% of nominal power output for 10 years, and 82.4% of nominal power output for 25 years for
	monocrystalline Panda PV modules. In addition, based on customers&rsquo; specific requirements, we also provide our multicrystalline
	PV modules with a linear-based warranty, which guarantees each year&rsquo;s power output during the twenty-five-year warranty period.
	In December&nbsp;2013, we entered into a similar module performance warranty insurance agreement with an insurance company for
	the same scope of beneficiaries during the period from January&nbsp;1, 2014 to December&nbsp;31, 2014, and renewed the agreement
	in March 2015 and January 2016 for the period from January&nbsp;1, 2015 to December&nbsp;31, 2015 and January&nbsp;1, 2016 to December&nbsp;31,
	2016, respectively. As a result, we bear the risk of warranty claims long after we have sold our products and recognized revenues.
	We have sold PV modules only since January&nbsp;2003, and none of our PV modules have been in use for the entire warranty period.
	We perform industry-standard testing to test the quality, durability and safety of our products. As a result of such tests, we
	believe that the quality, durability and safety of our products are within industry norms. Our estimate of the amount of our warranty
	obligations is based on the results of these tests, with consideration being given to the warranty accrual practice of other companies
	in the same business and our expected failure rate and costs to service failed products. Our warranty obligation will be affected
	by our estimated product failure rates, the costs to repair or replace failed products and potential service and delivery costs
	incurred in correcting product failures. Consequently, we accrue the equivalent of 1% of gross revenues as a warranty liability
	to accrue the estimated cost of our warranty obligations. During 2013, RMB14.3 million warranty costs were incurred or claimed,
	as a result of warranty claims in our PV modules that we had previously sold. As of December&nbsp;31, 2013, 2014 and 2015, our
	accrued warranty costs amounted to RMB666.9 million, RMB748.4 million, and RMB792.1 million (US$122.3 million), respectively. As
	of December&nbsp;31, 2013, 2014 and 2015, RMB626.3million, RMB707.5 million, and RMB753.3 million (US$116.3 million), respectively,
	in warranty costs were classified as noncurrent liabilities, which reflects our estimate of the timing of when the warranty expenditures
	will likely be made.

	We evaluate long-lived assets, including

	in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. We assess recoverability by comparing the
	carrying amount of an asset to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If the carrying
	amount of an asset exceeds its estimated undiscounted future cash flows, we recognize an impairment charge based on the amount
	by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset. We estimate the fair value of the asset based on
	the best information available, including prices for similar assets and, in the absence of an observable market price, the results
	of using a present value technique to estimate the fair value of the asset. Intangible assets that are not subject to amortization
	are tested annually for impairment at December 31, and are tested for impairment more frequently if events and circumstances indicate
	that the asset might be impaired. For intangible assets that are not subject to amortization, an impairment loss is recognized

	For the share options granted after our
	initial public offering, the fair value of our ordinary shares on the grant date is determined by the closing trade price of our
	ordinary shares on the grant date. Prior to 2011, due to the lack of a sufficient trading history at the time the options were
	issued, we estimated the expected volatility of our ordinary share price by referring to 11 comparable companies in the PV manufacturing
	business whose shares are publicly traded over the most recent period to be equal to the expected life of our employees&rsquo;
	share options. Starting in 2011, our calculation of expected volatility was based on the historical volatility of our stock price.

	Our inventories are stated at the lower
	of cost or market value. We routinely evaluate quantities and value of our inventories in light of current market conditions and
	market trends, and record a write-down against the cost of inventories for a decline in market value. Expected demand and anticipated
	sales prices are the key factors affecting our inventory valuation analysis. For purposes of our inventory valuation analysis,
	we develop expected demand and anticipated sales prices primarily based on sales orders and, to a far lesser extent, industry trends
	and individual customer analysis. We also consider sales and sales orders after each reporting period-end but before the issuance
	of our financial statements to assess the accuracy of our inventory valuation estimates. Historically, actual demand and sales
	prices have generally been consistent with or greater than expected demand and anticipated sales prices used for purposes of our
	inventory valuation analysis. The evaluation also takes into consideration new product development schedules, the effect that new
	products might have on sales of existing products, product obsolescence, customer concentrations, product merchantability and other
	factors. Market conditions are subject to change and actual consumption of inventories could differ from forecasted demand. Furthermore,
	the price of polysilicon, our primary raw material, is subject to fluctuations based on global supply and demand. Our management
	continually monitors changes in the purchase price we pay for polysilicon, including prepayments to suppliers, and the impact of
	such changes on our ability to recover the cost of inventory and our prepayments to suppliers. Our products have a long life cycle
	and obsolescence has not historically been a significant factor in the valuation of inventories. For the years ended December&nbsp;31,
	2013, 2014 and 2015, inventory write-downs due to the lower of cost or market assessment, which are included in the cost of revenues,
	were RMB5.0 million, RMB4.2 million, and RMB31.9 million (US$4.9 million), respectively.

	Until the third quarter of 2008, an industry-wide
	shortage of high purity polysilicon coupled with growing demand for PV modules caused polysilicon prices to increase. In order
	to ensure our adequate and timely supply of polysilicon, we entered into several long-term fixed price supply contracts from 2006
	to 2011 under which polysilicon would be delivered from 2009 to 2020.

	However, from the second quarter of 2011,
	the polysilicon price decreased significantly as the result of increased polysilicon manufacturing capacity and downward price
	pressure from the decreasing average selling price of PV modules. As a result, we recognized a provision of RMB851.7 million on
	the firm purchase commitments under our long-term fixed price polysilicon contracts as of December&nbsp;31, 2011. The provision
	was determined by applying a methodology similar to that used in the lower of cost or market evaluation with respect to inventory.&nbsp;During
	the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2011 and 2012, notwithstanding that the firm purchase commitments under our long-term fixed price
	contracts continued to be in effect, through negotiations with our vendors, we were able to obtain various pricing concessions
	from the vendors, which resulted in the actual purchase price paid by us to be less than the price stated in the contract.&nbsp;Our
	management believes that we will be able to continue to purchase polysilicon from these vendors at lower, renegotiated prices that
	are in line with the price prevailing in the open market. We therefore have reclassified the accrual for potential losses on inventory
	firm purchase commitments of RMB851.7 million as of December&nbsp;31, 2012 to an accrual for loss contingency related to the inventory
	purchase commitments.

	During the year ended December 31,
	2013, we continued to negotiate and execute amendments for current purchases on a quarterly or monthly basis with two of the
	vendors (hereafter &ldquo;Supplier B&rdquo; and &ldquo;Supplier C&rdquo;) and obtained price concessions that allowed us to
	purchase polysilicon at renegotiated prices that were close to market prices and significantly lower than the prices
	specified in the long-term fixed price supply contracts with those vendors.

	In addition, we continued to
	negotiate with these two vendors to amend the respective long-term fixed price supply contracts we had with them in order to
	remove the fixed price arrangements from those contracts. In October 2013, we entered into agreements with Supplier B
	to amend the long-term supply contract to include a price adjustment mechanism that allows us and Supplier B to renegotiate
	the purchase price on a quarterly basis within a specified price range set forth in the amendment based on prices then
	prevailing in the open market. We have not reached a similar agreement with Supplier C, but have continued to renegotiate
	prices on a quarterly or monthly basis to purchase polysilicon at prices closely approximating those available in the market.
	However, we refused to accept deliveries from Supplier C for a total of six months in 2012 and 2013 under the long-term fixed
	price supply contracts as our management determined after taking into consideration all relevant factors that it would be in
	our best interests not to accept those deliveries when they were due. As a result, because the contract has been
	substantially executed, Supplier C claimed that we had forfeited certain advance payments (see below for discussion of
	provision recorded in 2013 against these advances). Notwithstanding our refusal to accept deliveries for six months and
	Supplier C&rsquo;s claim as described above, we and Supplier C continued our monthly or quarterly negotiations and we have
	accepted deliveries from Supplier C after we had refused to do so during those six months.

	In 2013, we reassessed
	the probability of incurring a further loss under our long-term fixed price polysilicon contracts based on all of the
	developments in 2013 as well as considerations related to the more recent long-term fixed price contracts with another
	Supplier, Supplier A and recognized an additional provision of RMB393.0 million on the firm purchase commitments under our
	long-term fixed price polysilicon contracts as of December&nbsp;31, 2013.&nbsp;The provision was determined by applying a
	methodology similar to that used in the lower of cost or market evaluation with respect to inventory, using our
	management&rsquo;s best estimates of future purchase prices over the remaining terms of the contracts and applying such
	estimated purchase prices in the lower of cost or market evaluation. In estimating the renegotiated purchase prices, we
	considered the pertinent terms of each of the long-term supply contracts, the history and progress of renegotiation with the
	relevant vendors and the actual price concessions granted, developments in the polysilicon market based on available industry
	research data and the likelihood of achieving different levels of renegotiated prices for future periods.&nbsp;In addition to
	the estimated renegotiated purchase price, certain other key assumptions were used in measuring the loss accrual, which
	included but were not limited to (i)&nbsp;the estimated net realizable value of the PV modules manufactured from the
	polysilicon expected to be purchased under the long-term supply contracts; and (2)&nbsp;the normal profit margin of the PV
	modules for purposes of estimating the replacement cost (i.e., market) under the lower of cost or market model. In accordance
	with ASC 450-20, we did not take into consideration the discounting of the resultant accrual.&nbsp;We also considered the
	quantities that were required to be purchased and amount due on take or pay arrangements, as well as the history and progress
	of renegotiation with the relevant vendors and the actual concessions granted in developing the amount of the estimated loss
	contingencies.

	As of December 31, 2013,
	we recognised a total liability for loss on inventory purchase commitments of RMB 1,244.7 million, after excluding the portion
	of RMB87.1 million recorded as a reduction of &ldquo;Prepayment to suppliers&rdquo; related to Supplier C, was all related to
	the long-term fixed price polysilicon contracts with Supplier A, based on the management&rsquo;s

	In 2015, after our assessment
	by using same methodology mentioned above, no additional contingency losses for inventory firm purchase commitment with
	Supplier A was determined to be required in 2015. However, due to significant fluctuation in the foreign exchange rates
	between the RMB and US$ and given that the inventory purchase commitment to Supplier A is dominated in US dollar, which is
	different from the related entities&rsquo; functional currency, a foreign exchange re-measurement loss of RMB 77.7 million was recorded as additional provision. No such provision was recognised in 2014 since the foreign exchange rate was stable and the
	provision caused by the foreign exchange rate fluctuation was immaterial.

	We also had prepayments relating
	to the purchase contracts with Supplier A. As of December 31, 2014 and 2015, prepayments made by us to Supplier A remained
	RMB 224.0 million (US$34.5 million). In 2014 and 2015, due to the anti-dumping duty and anti-subsidy investigation
	against Solar-Grade Polysilicon launched by the Ministry of Commerce of the People&rsquo;s Republic of China, we did not make
	any purchase from Supplier A under the above-mentioned long-term fixed price supply contract, which was entered into in 2011
	and was effective from 2013 to 2020. We received invoices from Supplier A under its take-or-pay obligation for failing to
	take the shipments from 2013 to 2015 and is currently in discussion with Supplier
	A to seek an acceptable solution to both
	parties in accordance with the long-term supply contract. According to the long-term supply contracts, the minimum purchase
	amount approximates US$1.6 billion in total. We believes that, we will execute the agreements due to the &ldquo;take or
	pay&rdquo; obligation, which requires us to pay full amount to Supplier
	A according to the purchase and payment schedule as
	listed in the agreements, regardless of whether we actually purchase raw materials from Supplier
	A. In addition, we also
	believes that based upon the status of the negotiations with Supplier
	A, as of December 31, 2014 and 2015, it is reasonably
	assured that i) these prepayments are not legally forfeited; ii) these prepayments could be utilized for deliveries once we
	start purchasing from Supplier
	A. As a result, we believe that the total balance of the prepayments will be utilized for
	future purchases from Supplier
	A, and there was no need to make a reserve against the prepayments to this vendor in either 2014
	or 2015.

	best interest not to accept those deliveries when they were due (in 2014, we purchased the required amounts of polysilicon from
	Supplier C and utilized the portion of prepayments related to 2014). As a result, because the contract has been substantially performed,
	Supplier C claimed that certain advance payments had been forfeited.&nbsp;Unlike the take or pay obligation for Supplier A described
	in paragraph (a) above, if we fail to take the full amount of the agreed annual quantity in any calendar year, we do not
	have to pay for the remaining annual commitment, but rather only forfeit the unutilized portion of the prepayment related to that
	year. We do not have an obligation to pay for any unpurchased portion of the stated quantities. We recognised provisions of RMB87.1

	We establish an allowance for doubtful

	receivables based on a number of factors, including the customer&rsquo;s financial condition and creditworthiness. We make credit
	sales to major strategic customers in Europe. To reduce credit risks relating to other customers, we require some of our customers
	to pay a major portion of the purchase price by letters of credit. For the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2013, 2014 and 2015, our
	provisions for doubtful accounts amounted to RMB20.1 million, RMB228.8 million and RMB414.8 million (US$64.0 million), respectively.
	We recorded a reversal of allowance for doubtful accounts of RMB17.0 million, RMB59.5 million and RMB10.4 million (US$1.6 million)
	in 2013, 2014 and 2015, respectively, primarily due to the collection of a previously reserved amount from customers.

	A number of our loan agreements contain
	financial covenants that require us to maintain certain financial ratios, including debt-to-asset ratios. The worsening operating
	environment that has generally affected companies operating in our industry since the fourth quarter of 2008 had led to breaches
	and potential future breaches of certain financial covenants under some of our loan agreements. We had been in breach of certain
	financial covenants, such as debt-to-asset ratios, under certain loan agreements with commercial banks in China, which would have
	triggered cross-default provisions under most of other relevant loan agreements. As of May 16, 2016, we have obtained written waivers
	from all the relevant banks with which we have these affected loan agreements, waiving such past breaches and/or cross-defaults.
	In response to potential future breaches, we have had to negotiate with the relevant lenders terms of prepayment or to amend those
	financial covenants to prevent actual breaches from occurring, or requesting waivers of such financial covenants from those banks.
	Examples of amendments to such financial covenants would be to reset the financial covenants for the relevant loan agreements or
	to begin testing for compliance with the financial covenants at a deferred date. However, if we need in the future to renegotiate
	with our lenders again with respect to prepayment terms or to amend financial covenants or other relevant provisions, or to request
	waivers for financial covenants under such loan agreements to address potential breaches, we cannot assure you that we will be
	able to reach an agreement with any lender or to obtain any waiver so as to avoid a breach of an affected loan agreement. If we
	are found to be in breach of one or more financial covenants under any loan agreement and are not able to obtain a waiver from
	the relevant lender or to prepay the loan, such breach would constitute an event of default under the loan agreement. As a result,
	repayment of the indebtedness under the relevant loan agreement may be accelerated, which in turn may require us to repay the entire
	principal amount including interest, if any, accrued on certain of our other existing indebtedness under cross-default provisions
	in our existing loan agreements. If we are required to repay a significant portion or all of our existing indebtedness prior to
	its maturity, we may lack sufficient financial resources to do so. Furthermore, any breach of those financial covenants also will
	restrict our ability to pay dividends. Any of those events could have a material and adverse effect on our financial condition,
	results of operations and business prospects. See &ldquo;Item 3.D. Risk Factors &mdash; Risks Related to Us and the PV Industry
	&mdash; Tianwei Yingli is currently in payment default of the 2010 MTNs and 2011 MTNs, and we have breached in the past, and may
	breach in the future, certain financial and restrictive covenants of our loan agreements, which may result in lenders accelerating
	repayment of the affected loans and trigger cross-default provisions of other loans and borrowings, and we used to be overdue, and are still overdue, in some of our payment obligations under other financing

	In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09,
	Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) (&quot;ASU 2014-09&quot;). ASU 2014-09 supersedes the revenue recognition requirements
	in ASC Topic 605, Revenue Recognition, and most industry-specific guidance. The core principle of the guidance is that an entity
	should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration
	to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The new standard will require us to separate
	performance obligations within a contract, determine total transaction costs, and ultimately allocate the transaction costs across
	the established performance obligations. In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-14, &quot;Revenue from Contracts with Customers&quot;
	(Topic 606): Deferral of the Effective Date, which delays the effective date of ASU 2014-09 by one year. As a result, ASU 2014-09
	will become effective for us beginning in fiscal 2018 under either full or modified retrospective adoption, with early adoption
	permitted as of the original effective date of ASU 2014-09. We are currently assessing the potential significant effects of these

	In February 2015, the FASB issued the ASU
	2015-02, &quot;Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis&quot;. The objective of issuing the amendments in this Update is to change
	the analysis that a reporting entity must perform to determine whether it should consolidate certain types of legal entities. The
	amendments in this Update are an improvement to current US GAAP because they simplify the Codification and reduce the number of
	consolidation models through the elimination of the indefinite deferral of Statement 167 and because they place more emphasis on
	risk of loss when determining a controlling financial interest. The amendments in this Update are effective for public business
	entities for fiscal years, and for interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2015. Early adoption
	is permitted, including adoption in an interim period. If an entity early adopts the amendments in an interim period, any adjustments
	should be reflected as of the beginning of the fiscal year that includes that interim period. A reporting entity may apply the
	amendments in this Update using a modified retrospective approach by recording a cumulative-effect adjustment to equity as of the
	beginning of the fiscal year of adoption. A reporting entity also may apply the amendments retrospectively. We plan to apply this
	standard beginning in 2016 and does not expect this guidance to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.

	In April 2015, the FASB issued the ASU No.
	2015-03, Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs (&quot;ASU 2015-03&quot;), which changes the presentation of debt
	issuance costs in financial statements. Under ASU 2015-03, an entity will present such costs in the balance sheet as a direct deduction
	from the related debt liability rather than as an asset. Amortization of the costs will continue to be reported as interest expense.
	In August 2015, the FASB issued the ASU No. 2015-15&mdash;Presentation and Subsequent Measurement of Debt Issuance Costs Associated
	with Line-of-Credit Arrangements (&quot;ASU 2015-15&quot;), which incorporates the SEC staff's announcement that clarifies the
	exclusion of line-of-credit arrangements from the scope of ASU 2015-03. The ASU clarifies that debt issuance costs related to line-of-credit
	arrangements can be deferred and presented as an asset that is subsequently amortized over the time of the line-of-credit arrangement,
	regardless of whether there are any outstanding borrowings on the line-of-credit arrangement. ASU 2015-03 is effective retrospectively

	requirement that deferred tax liabilities and assets of a tax-paying component of an entity be offset and presented as a single
	amount is not affected by the amendments in this Update. For public business entities, the amendments in this Update are effective
	for financial statements issued for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those annual periods,
	with early adoption permitted. The amendments in this Update may be applied either prospectively to all deferred tax liabilities
	and assets or retrospectively to all periods presented. If an entity applies the guidance prospectively, the entity should disclose
	in the first interim and first annual period of change, the nature of and reason for the change in accounting principle and a statement
	that prior periods were not retrospectively adjusted. If an entity applies the guidance retrospectively, the entity should disclose
	in the first interim and first annual period of change the nature of and reason for the change in accounting principle and quantitative

	and that do not qualify for the practical expedient to estimate fair value. A policy election can be made for these investments
	whereby estimated fair value may be measured at cost and adjusted in subsequent periods for any impairment or changes in observable

	assess the embedded call (put) options solely in accordance with the four-step decision sequence. Consequently, when a call (put)
	option is contingently exercisable, an entity does not have to assess whether the event that triggers the ability to exercise a
	call (put) option is related to interest rates or credit risks. The amendments are an improvement to GAAP because they eliminate
	diversity in practice in assessing embedded contingent call (put) options in debt instruments. For public companies, the amendments
	in this Update are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within those fiscal
	years. An entity should apply the amendments in this Update on a modified retrospective basis to existing debt instruments as of
	the beginning of the fiscal year for which the amendments are effective. We are currently assessing the potential significant effects
	of these changes on our consolidated financial statements.

	In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-07,
	Simplifying the Transition to the Equity Method of Accounting. The amendments in this Update eliminate the requirement that when
	an investment qualified for use of the equity method as a result of an increase in the level of ownership interest or degree of
	influence, an investor must adjust the investment, results of operations, and retained earnings retroactively on a step-by-step
	basis as if the equity method had been in effect during all previous periods that the investment had been held. The amendments
	require that the equity method investor add the cost of acquiring the additional interest in the investee to the current basis
	of the investor's previous held interest and adopt the equity method of accounting as of the date the investment becomes qualified
	for equity method accounting. Therefore, upon qualifying for the equity method of accounting, no retroactive adjustment of the
	investment is required. The amendments in this Update require that an entity that has an available-for-sale equity security that
	becomes qualified for the equity method of accounting recognize through earnings the unrealized holding gain or loss in accumulated
	other comprehensive income at the date the investment becomes qualified for use of the equity method. The amendments in this Update
	are effective for all entities for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2016.
	The amendments should be applied prospectively upon their effective date to increase in the level of ownership interest or degree
	of influence that result in the adoption of the equity method. Earlier application is permitted. We are currently assessing the
	potential significant effects of these changes on our consolidated financial statements.

	The primary focus of our research and development
	efforts is on improving our manufacturing processes at every stage of our production in order to improve the output quality at
	each stage and deliver more energy-efficient and aesthetically improved PV products at a lower cost. We currently produce multicrystalline
	polysilicon ingots primarily weighing up to 800 kilograms. Our research goals with regard to wafer cutting techniques include improving
	the surface and internal physical characteristics of our wafers so as to decrease the wafer breakage rate and increase the number
	of wafers produced from each ingot, as well as reduce the wafer thickness. We are also improving our ingot casting and crystal
	growing processes to reduce the amount of time required for ingot formation, increase ingot output and reduce the cost of raw materials.

	We believe that PV cells made from crystalline
	silicon will continue to dominate the PV market in the foreseeable future. Therefore, our research and development efforts as they
	relate to PV cells have focused on improving technologies and processing techniques to increase the conversion efficiency and the
	power output of our PV cells, all of which were traditionally made from multicrystalline silicon. Starting from June&nbsp;2009,
	we have been in collaboration with the Energy Research Centre of the Netherlands, a leading solar research center in Europe, and
	Tempress Systems, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Amtech Systems,&nbsp;Inc., a global supplier of production and automation systems
	and related supplies for the manufacture of PV cells, to implement Project PANDA, a research and development project for next-generation
	high efficiency monocrystalline PV cells. Our 600 megawatts of PANDA production capacity for each of the ingots and wafers, cells
	and modules in Baoding, Hebei Province started initial production in the second quarter of 2011. We successfully produced next-generation
	cells with an average cell conversion efficiency rate of 20.5% on the PANDA commercial production lines in 2015 with a high record
	of cell conversion efficiency rate of 21.5% in the lab. We also seek to reduce the breakage rate and failure rate and increase
	the success rate and conversion efficiency of our PV cells through the use of advanced equipment and improved manufacturing processes
	at each stage of our production. To ensure the competitiveness of our products, we closely monitor the development by our competitors
	of new-generation PV cells, such as thin film cells, that may or may not be made from crystalline silicon and will seek to respond
	to challenges and opportunities posed by new technology as appropriate.

	We have upgraded our module assembly techniques
	to accommodate the delicate nature of thinner PV cells. We are researching new solutions to lengthen our PV modules&rsquo; life
	span and make them more reliable, and to further increase the conversion efficiency of our PV cells and PV modules through the
	use of new materials and new technologies. In addition, we are working to improve our technologies to manufacture PV modules that
	can be used as construction materials. We are also exploring multipurpose applications of our off-grid PV systems, and collaborating
	with international PV system installers and integrators by participating in large on-grid PV system projects in order to accumulate
	more experience and knowledge with respect to such projects.

	to constitute a majority of the board, then in office. Upon a change of control, the compensation committee may decide that all
	outstanding awards that are exercisable or otherwise unvested or subject to lapse restrictions will automatically be deemed exercisable
	or otherwise vested or no longer subject to lapse restrictions, as the case may be, as of immediately prior to such acquisition.
	The compensation committee may also, in its sole discretion, decide to cancel such awards for fair value, provide for the issuance
	of substitute awards that will substantially preserve the otherwise applicable terms of any affected awards previously granted,

	Pursuant to the relevant PRC regulations,
	we are required to make contributions for each employee at a rate of 20% of a standard salary base as determined by the local social
	security bureau to a defined contribution retirement scheme organized by the local social security bureau. In addition, we are
	also required to make contributions for each employee at rates of 6%-11%, 1%-2% and 0.9%-1.7% of a standard base for medical insurance
	benefits, unemployment and other statutory benefits, respectively. We are also required to make contributions to housing provident
	fund for our employees, which varies, according to the locations and salary bands, from hundreds to thousands of RMB monthly for
	each employee. In accordance with the local regulation in China where we have operations, we are required to make these contributions
	on a monthly basis, and will be subject to penalties if we delay any of such contributions for more than three months. Due to our
	tight cash flow in 2015, some of our subsidiaries failed to fully make contributions to the social insurances and housing provident
	fund for their employees on time and the amount overdue was approximately RMB80.0 million as of May 16, 2016. As such, these subsidiaries
	are not in compliance with local regulations on social insurances and housing provident fund, and could be subject to penalties
	from local regulatory authorities. We have engaged in active discussions with the relevant local regulatory authorities, clarifying
	our situation to them and seeking their understanding. While the local regulatory authorities indicated that they understood our
	situation and had not imposed any penalties on us yet, there can be no assurance that they will not impose penalties on us in the
	future. We plan to gradually pay all overdue amounts before the end of 2016. See &ldquo;Item 3.D. Risk Factors &mdash; Risks Related

	Yingli Green Energy Americas,&nbsp;Inc., or Yingli Americas, and two other China-based solar manufacturers in the U.S. District

	America,&nbsp;Inc., Trina Solar Ltd. and Trina Solar (U.S.) Inc.) in early March&nbsp;2013. On April&nbsp;9, 2014, we received
	an order denying defendants&rsquo; joint motion to dismiss Solyndra&rsquo;s claims. In February 2016, we entered into an agreement
	to settle these claims, or the Settlement Agreement. According to the Settlement Agreement, we and Yingli Americas paid US$7.5
	million to settle Solyndra&rsquo;s claims. If the annual total sales of PV modules from us and all of our affiliates in any single
	calendar year between 2016 to 2018 to the United States and Canada and any of their respective territories or districts equals
	or exceeds 800 megawatts, we will pay Solyndra a single additional payment of US$10 million. The Settlement Agreement was approved
	by United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware, which is responsible for adjudicating the Solyndra bankruptcy,
	in March 2016. The aforementioned lawsuit against us has been dismissed with prejudice, and under the Settlement Agreement, Solyndra
	has released us and all of our affiliates from any further claims based on the same or any related facts or allegations. In 2015,
	we recognized provisions of settlement fee of US$7.5 million (RMB48.7 million) and we didn&rsquo;t recognize any provisions for
	the conditional additional payment of US$10 million (RMB 64.8 million) since it is not probable that a liability has been incurred.

	financial information. In October 2015, the cases were consolidated and the court appointed lead plaintiffs and lead counsel. In
	November 2015, lead plaintiffs filed a consolidated amended complaint. The amended complaint contends that we and certain of our

	government&rsquo;s Golden Sun program, which provided subsidies for solar projects in China; and (ii) our accounts receivable attributable

	the imposition of anti-dumping duties on these solar panels from China. CCCME is responsible for allocating the quota among these
	exporters, and we have been allocated a portion of the quota. On December&nbsp;5, 2013, the Council of European Union adopted the
	final findings of the European Commission and imposed anti-dumping and anti-subsidy duties on CSPV modules and key components (i.e.
	cells) originating in or consigned from People&rsquo; s Republic of China. Wafers were excluded from the product scope. The anti-dumping
	duty rates ranged from 27.3% to 64.9%, while the anti-subsidy duty rates from 0% to 11.5%. The rates applicable to us are 35.5%
	and 6.3%, respectively. The definitive duties will be imposed for a two-year period starting from December&nbsp;6, 2013. At the
	same time, the Council of European Union also confirmed the acceptance by European Commission of the Undertaking.

	On November&nbsp;7, 2012, the U.S. International
	Trade Commission (ITC) determined that CSPV modules produced from Chinese cells are materially injuring the U.S. CSPV cells and
	modules industry. The U.S. Department of Commerce, or the DOC, issued its final determinations on the rates of the anti-dumping,
	or AD, and countervailing duties, or CVD, on October&nbsp;10, 2012, which became effective upon issuance of the final anti-dumping
	and countervailing duties orders in early December&nbsp;2012. As a result of such final determinations, we, as a voluntary respondent,
	are subject to an average aggregated AD/CVD rate of 29.18%. However, this average aggregated AD/CVD rate might be subject to change
	due to the administrative review process initiated by DOC in early 2014. We are mandatory respondent in the first administrative
	review on the anti-dumping investigation and had obtained a much lower preliminary anti-dumping rate than in the original investigations.

	On January&nbsp;23, 2014, the DOC initiated
	a parallel AD investigation on CSPV products from Mainland China and Taiwan and CVD investigation on CSPV products from Mainland
	China. The products concerned are crystalline silicon photovoltaic cells, and modules, laminates and/or panels consisting of crystalline
	silicon photovoltaic cells, whether or not partially or fully assembled into other products, including building integrated materials.
	Subject merchandise also includes modules, laminates and/or panels assembled in Mainland China and Taiwan consisting of crystalline
	silicon photovoltaic cells that are completed or partially manufactured within a customs territory other than Mainland China and
	Taiwan, using ingots, wafers that are manufactured in Mainland China and Taiwan, or cells where the manufacturing process begins
	in Mainland China and Taiwan and is completed in other countries. On December&nbsp;23, 2014, the DOC published its confirmative
	final determination on these investigations by imposing punitive AD tariffs ranging from 26.71% to 165.04% and CVD tariffs ranging
	from 27.64% to 49.21%. As a separate rate company in these investigations, the AD&amp;CVD tariffs applicable to the Company will
	be 52.31% and 38.43%, respectively. On February&nbsp;10, 2015, the ITC issued its final injury determinations by confirming injury
	to the US CSPV module industry by Chinese CSPV module manufacturers. As a result of the determinations by DOC and ITC, Chinese
	modules integrating cells from third countries will be subject to the new AD and CVD tariffs when exported to the US. Although
	we have very limited sales of modules to the US incorporating third country cells, such determinations may adversely affect our
	business flexibility in the US market and our business in the US may be materially and adversely impacted.

	On February 3, 2016, the DOC initiated
	the third administrative review of antidumping duty (&ldquo;Solar 1 AD AR3&rdquo;) on CSPC whether or not assembled into modules
	(certain solar cells and panels) from the PRC covering the period of December 1, 2014 to November 30, 2015. Subject merchandise
	includes crystalline silicon PV, modules or panels, whether or not partially or fully assembled into other products, including,
	but not limited to modules, laminates, and building integrated materials. On February 4, 2016, the U.S. Customs and Border Protection,
	or US CBP, released data concerning the imports of solar cells and modules from the PRC. On the same day, we, as a listed party,
	were required by the DOC to file a Quantity &amp; Value, or Q&amp;V, questionnaire which affords interested parties an opportunity
	to request an administrative review or to avoid being selected as a mandatory respondent by providing responses to the questionnaire
	by February 24, 2016

	We have filed the Q&amp;V and provided all documents required by the DOC. On March 31, 2016,
	the DOC informed us that we are not selected as mandatory respondent in this third AD review, and we have filed a letter with the
	DOC withdrawing Yingli&rsquo;s request for a review in Solar 1 AD AR3 on May 4, 2016. In this situation, we will be assigned the
	average of the margins calculated for Trina and Canadian Solar in the final results of Solar 1 AD AR3 if only Yingli withdraws.
	&nbsp;If both Yingli and Solar World withdraw the review requests, we would no longer be under review and the entries of subject
	merchandise into the United States during the AR3 review period (December 1, 2014 &ndash; November 30, 2015) would be liquidated
	at the AD rates applicable at the time of entry (i.e., 13.94% for entries between December 1, 2014 and July 13, 2015, and 0.79%
	for entries between July 14, 2015 and November 30, 2015).&nbsp;On February 4, 2016, the US CBP released data concerning the imports
	of solar cells and modules from the PRC related to an anti-subsidy investigation of Chinese companies (&ldquo;Solar 1 CVD AR3&rdquo;).
	We were selected as a mandatory party by the DOC on March 10, 2016. The deadline for us to withdraw the request is May 9, 2016.
	However, we have already withdrawn the review on March 17, 2016, and in this situation, the rate 20.94% in Solar 1CVD AR1 shall
	still apply to us.

	Under the &ldquo;Enterprise Income Tax
	Law of the PRC,&rdquo; or the EIT Law, which took effect as of January&nbsp;1, 2008, enterprises established under the laws of
	non-PRC jurisdictions but whose &ldquo;de facto management bodies&rdquo; are located in the PRC are considered &ldquo;resident
	enterprises&rdquo; for PRC tax purposes and are generally subject to the uniform 25% enterprise income tax rate as to their worldwide
	income. Under the implementation rules&nbsp;for the EIT Law, a &ldquo;de facto management body&rdquo; is defined as a body that
	has substantial and overall management and control over the manufacturing and business operations, personnel, accounting, properties
	and other factors of an enterprise. On April&nbsp;22, 2009, the State Administration of Taxation promulgated a circular which sets
	out criteria for determining whether &ldquo;de facto management bodies&rdquo; are located in China for overseas incorporated, domestically
	controlled enterprises. However, as this circular only applies to enterprises incorporated under laws of foreign countries or regions
	that are controlled by PRC enterprises or groups of PRC enterprises, it remains unclear how the tax authorities will determine
	the location of &ldquo;de facto management bodies&rdquo; for overseas incorporated enterprises that are controlled by individual
	PRC residents like us and some of our subsidiaries. Therefore, although substantially all of our management is currently located
	in the PRC, it is unclear whether PRC tax authorities would require or permit our overseas registered entities to be treated as
	PRC resident enterprises. If the PRC tax authorities determine that Yingli Green Energy and some of our subsidiaries, such as Yingli
	International, Yingli Capital, Yingli Hong Kong, Cyber Power and Cyber Lighting, are PRC resident enterprises, we and such subsidiaries
	may be subject to the enterprise income tax at the rate of 25% as to our global income. In April&nbsp;2009, the State Administration
	of Taxation issued Circular Guoshuihan 2009 No.&nbsp;203 (&ldquo;Circular 203&rdquo;) stipulating that entities which qualified
	for &ldquo;High and New Technology Enterprise&rdquo;, or &ldquo;HNTE&rdquo; status should apply with the relevant tax authorities
	to enjoy the reduced EIT rate of 15.0% provided under the EIT Law starting from the year when the HNTE certificate becomes effective.
	In addition, an entity which qualified for HNTE status can continue to enjoy its remaining tax holiday from January&nbsp;1, 2008
	provided that it has obtained the HNTE certificate according to the new recognition criteria set by the EIT Law and the relevant
	regulations.

	Moreover, the implementation rules&nbsp;for
	the EIT Law provide that a withholding tax rate of 10% is generally applicable to dividends paid to non-PRC investors who are &ldquo;non-resident
	enterprises&rdquo; and a withholding tax rate of 20% is generally applicable for non-PRC individual investors to the extent such
	dividends are derived from sources within the PRC, unless any such non-PRC investor&rsquo;s jurisdiction of incorporation has a
	tax treaty with China that provides for a different withholding arrangement. Furthermore, a circular issued by the MOF and the
	State Administration of Taxation on February&nbsp;22, 2008 stipulates that undistributed earnings generated prior to January&nbsp;1,
	2008 are exempt from enterprise income tax. We are a Cayman Islands holding company, Yingli International is a British Virgin Islands
	intermediate holding company and Cyber Lighting is a Hong Kong intermediate holding company. The Cayman Islands and the British
	Virgin Islands where such holding companies are incorporated do not have a tax treaty with China. According to the Arrangement
	between Mainland China and Hong Kong Special Administrative Region on the Avoidance of Double Taxation and Prevention of Fiscal
	Evasion with respect to Tax on Income entered into in August&nbsp;2006, or the Mainland and the Hong Kong Taxation Arrangement
	and its relevant regulations, subject to the confirmation of the in-charge local tax authority, dividends paid by a foreign-invested
	enterprise in China to its direct holding company in Hong Kong will be subject to withholding tax at a rate of no more than 5%,
	if the foreign investor is the &ldquo;beneficial owner&rdquo; and owns directly at least 25% of the equity interest of the foreign-invested
	enterprise. The State Administration of Taxation promulgated the Notice on How to Understand and Determine the Beneficial Owners
	in Tax Agreement in October&nbsp;2009, or Circular 601, which provides guidance for determining whether a resident of a contracting
	state is the &ldquo;beneficial owner&rdquo; of an item of income under China&rsquo;s tax treaties and tax arrangements. According
	to Circular 601, a beneficial owner generally must be engaged in substantive business activities. An agent or conduit company will
	not be regarded as a beneficial owner and, therefore, will not qualify for treaty benefits. The conduit company normally refers
	to a company that is set up for the purpose of avoiding or reducing taxes or transferring or accumulating profits. Substantially
	all of our income may be derived from dividends we receive from our operating subsidiaries located in the PRC. Thus, dividends
	for earnings accumulated beginning on January&nbsp;1, 2008 payable to us by our subsidiaries in China, if any, will be subject
	to a 10% income tax or, in the case of the dividends paid to Cyber Lighting, 5% income tax (subject to the confirmation of the
	local tax authority) if we are considered as &ldquo;non-resident enterprises&rdquo; under the EIT Law.

	With respect to certain non-corporate U.S.
	Holders, certain dividends received from a qualified foreign corporation may be subject to reduced rates of taxation. A foreign
	corporation is treated as a qualified foreign corporation with respect to dividends received from that corporation on shares (or
	ADSs representing such shares) that are readily tradable on an established securities market in the United States. United States
	Treasury Department guidance indicates that depositary shares such as the ADSs (which are listed on the NYSE), but not our ordinary
	shares, are treated as readily tradable on an established securities market in the United States for these purposes. Thus, while
	we believe that the ADSs currently should be considered readily tradable on an established securities market in the United States
	for these purposes, we do not believe that dividends that we pay on our ordinary shares that are not represented by ADSs currently
	meet the conditions required for these reduced tax rates. There can be no assurance that the ADSs will be considered readily tradable
	on an established securities market in later years. A qualified foreign corporation also includes a foreign corporation that is
	eligible for the benefits of certain income tax treaties with the United States. In the event that we are deemed to be a PRC &ldquo;resident
	enterprise&rdquo; under PRC tax law (see &ldquo;&mdash; People&rsquo;s Republic of China Taxation&rdquo;), we may be eligible for
	the benefits of the income tax treaty between the United States and the PRC, and if we are eligible for such benefits, dividends
	we pay on our ordinary shares, regardless of whether such shares are represented by ADSs, may be eligible for the reduced rates
	of taxation. Non-corporate holders that do not meet a minimum holding period requirement during which they are not protected from
	the risk of loss or that elect to treat the dividend income as &ldquo;investment income&rdquo; pursuant to Section&nbsp;163(d)(4)&nbsp;of
	the Code will not be eligible for the reduced rates of taxation regardless of our status as a qualified foreign corporation. In
	addition, the rate reduction will not apply to dividends if the recipient of a dividend is obligated to make related payments with
	respect to positions in substantially similar or related property. This disallowance applies even if the minimum holding period
	has been met. You should consult your own tax advisors regarding the application of these rules&nbsp;given your particular circumstances.

	Under the PRC tax law, if the dividends
	paid by us are deemed to be derived from sources within the PRC, you may be subject to PRC withholding taxes on dividends paid
	to you with respect to the ADSs or ordinary shares. Subject to certain conditions and limitations, PRC withholding taxes on dividends,
	if any, generally will be treated as foreign taxes eligible for credit against your United States federal income tax liability.
	For purposes of calculating the foreign tax credit, dividends paid on the ADSs or ordinary shares will be treated as income from
	sources outside the United States and will generally constitute passive category income. Further, in certain circumstances, if
	you have held ADSs or ordinary shares for less than a specified minimum period, or are obligated to make payments with respect
	to positions in substantially similar or related property, you will not be allowed a foreign tax credit for foreign taxes imposed

	To the extent that the amount of any distribution

	the ADSs or ordinary shares (thereby increasing the amount of gain, or decreasing the amount of loss, to be recognized by you on
	a subsequent disposition of the ADSs or ordinary shares), and the balance in excess of adjusted basis will be taxed as capital

	For United States federal income tax purposes,
	you will recognize taxable gain or loss on any sale or exchange of ADSs or ordinary shares in an amount equal to the difference
	between the amount realized for the ADSs or ordinary shares and your tax basis in the ADSs or ordinary shares. Such gain or loss
	will generally be capital gain or loss. Capital gains of non-corporate U.S. Holders (including individuals) derived with respect
	to capital assets held for more than one year are eligible for reduced rates of taxation. The deductibility of capital losses is
	subject to limitations. Any gain or loss recognized by you will generally be treated as United States source gain or loss. However,
	in the event that we are deemed to be a PRC &ldquo;resident enterprise&rdquo; under PRC tax law (see &ldquo;&mdash; People&rsquo;s
	Republic of China Taxation&rdquo;), we may also be treated as a PRC tax resident for purposes of the income tax treaty between
	the United States and the PRC. If any PRC tax were to be imposed on any gain from the disposition of the ADSs or ordinary shares
	and if you are eligible for the benefits of the treaty, you may elect to treat such gain as PRC source gain under the treaty. If
	you are not eligible for the benefits of the treaty or you fail to make the election to treat any gain as PRC source, then you
	generally would not be able to use the foreign tax credit arising from any PRC tax imposed on the disposition of the ADSs or ordinary

	Fluctuations in currency exchange rates
	could have a significant effect on our financial stability due to a mismatch among various foreign currency-denominated assets
	and liabilities. Fluctuations in exchange rates, particularly among the U.S. dollar, Euro and Renminbi, affect our net profit margins
	and would result in foreign currency exchange gains or losses on our foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities. Our exposure
	to foreign exchange risk primarily relates to foreign currency exchange gains or losses resulting from timing differences between
	the signing of sales contracts or raw material supply contracts and the receipt of payment and the settlement or disbursement relating
	to these contracts. For example, the depreciation of the Euro against the Renminbi, such as in the third quarter and the fourth
	quarter of 2014 and the first quarter of 2015, has adversely affected and could continue to adversely affect our total net revenues.

	As of December&nbsp;31, 2015, we held an
	equivalent of RMB2,902.1 million (US$448.0 million) in accounts receivable and prepayments to suppliers (excluding the non-current
	portion), of which an equivalent of RMB538.2 million (US$83.1 million) were denominated in U.S. dollars and RMB132.1 million (US$20.4
	million) were denominated in Euros. As the substantial majority of our sales of our products and purchases of our raw materials
	are denominated in U.S. dollars and Euros, any significant fluctuations in the exchange rates between the Renminbi and the U.S.
	dollar and/or the Euro could have a material and adverse effect on our results of operations. Moreover, we had significant monetary
	assets and liabilities denominated in U.S. dollars and Euros as of December&nbsp;31, 2015, which consisted mainly of accounts receivable,
	prepayments to suppliers and accounts payable. Fluctuations in foreign exchange rates could also have a material adverse effect
	on the value of these monetary assets and liabilities denominated in U.S. dollars and Euros. Generally, appreciation of the Renminbi
	against the U.S. dollar and Euro will result in foreign exchange losses for monetary assets denominated in U.S. dollars and Euros
	and foreign exchange gains for monetary liabilities denominated in U.S. dollars and Euros. Conversely, depreciation of the Renminbi
	against the U.S. dollar and Euro will generally result in foreign exchange gains for monetary assets denominated in U.S. dollars
	and Euros and foreign exchange losses for monetary liabilities denominated in U.S. dollars and Euro.

	(US$74.6 million) for our accounts receivable and prepayments to suppliers denominated in U.S. dollars as of December&nbsp;31,
	2015. These amounts would represent net loss of RMB55.0 million (US$8.5 million) for our accounts receivable and prepayment to

	to suppliers denominated in U.S. dollars as of December&nbsp;31, 2015. These amounts would represent net income of RMB52.4 million

	In 2014, our net foreign currency exchange
	loss was RMB243.4 million, increased from RMB32.2 million in 2013, which was mainly due to depreciation of the U.S. dollar and
	the Euro against the Renminbi. However, the depreciation of Renminbi against U.S. dollar and the Euro in 2015 caused our foreign
	currency exchange loss to decrease to RMB132.7 million (US$20.5 million) in 2015 from RMB243.4 million in 2014. In addition, we
	have entered into hedging and foreign currency forward arrangements to limit our exposure to foreign currency exchange risk. We
	expect that we will continue to be exposed to foreign currency exchange risk to the extent that our hedging and foreign currency
	forward arrangements do not cover all of our expected revenues denominated in foreign currencies. We cannot predict the effect
	of exchange rate fluctuations on our foreign exchange gains or losses in the future. We may continue to reduce the effect of such
	exposure through foreign currency forward or other similar arrangements, but because of the limited availability of such instruments
	in China, we cannot assure you that we will always find a hedging arrangement suitable to us, or that such derivative activities
	will be effective in managing our foreign exchange risk. The value of your investment in our company will be affected by the foreign
	exchange rate between U.S. dollars and Renminbi. For example, a decline in the value of the Renminbi against the U.S. dollar could
	reduce the U.S. dollar equivalent amounts of our financial results, the dividends Tianwei Yingli may pay us in the future and the
	value of your investment in us, all of which may have a material adverse effect on the value of the ADSs.

	Our exposure to interest rate risk primarily
	relates to our interest expenses incurred by our short-term and long-term borrowings and interest income generated by excess cash
	invested in demand deposits. Such interest-earning instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk. As of December&nbsp;31, 2015,
	we had RMB9,124.2 million (US$1,408.5 million) in outstanding short-term borrowings (including the current portion of medium-term
	notes and long-term debt), RMB300.0 million (US$46.3 million) in outstanding medium-term notes and RMB2,405.9 million (US$371.4
	million) in outstanding long-term debt (excluding the current portion). We have not used any derivative financial instruments to
	manage our interest rate risk exposure due to the lack of such financial instruments in China. We have not been exposed nor do
	we anticipate being exposed to material risks due to changes in interest rates. However, our future interest expense may increase
	due to changes in interest rates prevailing in the open market. If market interest rates for short-term demand deposits increase
	in the near future, such increase may cause the amount of our interest income to rise. A hypothetical 10% increase in the average
	interest rate for our bank borrowings would result in an increase of approximately RMB901.9 million (US$139.2 million) in interest
	expense in 2015. We may use derivative financial instruments, such as interest rate swaps, to mitigate potential risks of interest
	expense increases due to changes in market interest rates.

	We are a &ldquo;foreign private issuer&rdquo;
	(as such term is defined in Rule&nbsp;3b-4 under the Exchange Act), and the ADSs, each representing one ordinary share, are listed
	on the NYSE. Under Section&nbsp;303A of the NYSE Listed Company Manual, NYSE listed companies that are foreign private issuers
	are permitted to follow home country practice in lieu of the corporate governance provisions specified by the NYSE with limited
	exceptions. The following summarizes some significant ways in which our corporate governance practices differ from those followed
	by domestic companies under the listing standards of the NYSE.

	Under the NYSE Listed Company Manual, or
	the NYSE Manual, U.S. domestic listed companies are required to have a nominating/corporate governance committee, composed entirely
	of independent directors. In addition to identifying individuals qualified to become board members, the nominating/corporate governance
	committee must develop and recommend to the board a set of corporate governance principles. We do not have a nominating/corporate
	governance committee, and the Companies Law of the Cayman Islands does not require companies incorporated in Cayman Islands to
	have a nominating/corporate governance committee. Currently, our board of directors performs the duties of the nominating/corporate
	governance committee and regularly reviews our corporate governance principles and practice.

	&nbsp;

<P STYLE="FONT: 10PT TIMES NEW ROMAN, TIMES, SERIF; MARGIN: 0PT 0; TEXT-INDENT: 31.9PT">
	The NYSE Manual also requires U.S. domestic
	listed companies to regularly hold executive sessions for non-management directors, or an executive session that only includes
	independent directors at least once a year. We are not subject to this requirement under the Cayman Islands laws and have decided
	to follow our home country practice on this matter. In addition, the NYSE Manual requires shareholder approval for certain matters,
	such as requiring that shareholders must be given the opportunity to vote on all equity compensation plans and material revisions
	to those plans, which is not required under the Cayman Islands laws. We intend to comply with the requirements of Cayman Islands
	laws only in determining whether shareholder approval is required.

	December 31,

	December 31, 2015 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United State of America. Also in our opinion,
	the Company did not maintain, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31,
	2015, based on criteria established in
<I>
	Internal Control - Integrated Framework
</I>
<I>
	(2013)
</I>
	issued by the Committee of
	Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) because a material weakness in internal control over financial reporting
	related to the lack of sufficient accounting and financial reporting personnel to formalize and carry out key controls over the
	reporting process with respect to certain significant and complex accounting assessments and the preparation of the financial statements
	in accordance with U.S. GAAP and SEC reporting requirements existed as of that date. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a
	combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material
	misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. The material weakness
	referred to above is described in Management&rsquo;s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting appearing under
	Item 15. We considered this material weakness in determining the nature, timing, and extent of audit tests applied in our audit
	of the 2015 consolidated financial statements and our opinion regarding the effectiveness of the Company&rsquo;s internal control
	over financial reporting does not affect our opinion on those consolidated financial statements. The Company's management is responsible
	for these financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the
	effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Management&rsquo;s Annual Report on Internal Control over
	Financial Reporting appearing under Item 15 of Form 20-F. Our responsibility is to express opinions on these financial statements
	and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our integrated audits. We conducted our audits in accordance
	with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform
	the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether
	effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the financial statements
	included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the
	accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
	Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting,
	assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal
	control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the
	circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.

	of the equity investment at risk lack the ability to make certain decisions, the obligation to absorb expected losses or the right

	the Company; 2) if PV stations are sold to a third party as authorized by the Company, the Company would enjoy all income

	products would not be commercially viable on a sustainable basis without government incentives.&nbsp;This is largely in part caused

	The Company obtains some equipment to be used in its
	manufacturing process from a small number of selected equipment suppliers. In addition, some equipment has been customized based
	on the Company&rsquo;s specifications, is not readily available from multiple vendors and would be difficult to repair or replace.
	If any of these suppliers were to experience financial difficulties or go out of business, the Company may have difficulties in
	repairing or replacing its equipment in the event of any damage to the manufacturing equipment or a breakdown of the production
	process. The Company&rsquo;s ability to deliver products timely would suffer, which in turn could result in order cancellations
	and loss of revenue. A supplier&rsquo;s failure to deliver the equipment in a timely manner with adequate quality and on terms
	acceptable to the Company could delay its capacity expansion of manufacturing facilities and otherwise disrupt its production schedule
	or increase its costs of production.&nbsp;The Company made deposits of RMB 327,275 and RMB 81,828 (US$&nbsp;12,632) as of December&nbsp;31,
	2014 and 2015, respectively, for the purchase of equipment without receiving collateral for such payments. As a result, the Company&rsquo;s

	places bank deposits with large financial institutions in the PRC with acceptable credit rating.&nbsp;As of December&nbsp;31, 2014
	and 2015, the Company had cash balances at two and one PRC individual financial institutions, respectively, that held cash balances
	in excess of 10% of the Company&rsquo;s total cash balances. These bank deposits collectively accounted for approximately 37.2%
	and 34.4% of the Company&rsquo;s total cash balances as of December&nbsp;31, 2014 and 2015, respectively. Management believes that
	these financial institutions are of high credit quality.

	The preparation of consolidated financial statements
	in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management of the Company to make a number of estimates and assumptions relating to the reported
	amounts of assets and liabilities as well as with respect to the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of
	the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results
	could differ from those estimates.&nbsp; Significant items subject to such estimates and assumptions include the fair values of
	assets acquired and liabilities assumed in business acquisitions, the useful lives of property, plant and equipment and intangibles
	with definite lives, recoverability of the carrying values of property, plant and equipment, and intangible assets, the fair value

	income tax assets, the fair values of financial and equity instruments, the accruals for warranty obligations and loss contingency,
	and provision for inventory purchase commitments.&nbsp;The current economic environment has increased the degree of uncertainty

	Adjustments are recorded to write down the carrying
	amount of any obsolete and excess inventory to its estimated net realizable value. Certain factors could impact the realizable
	value of inventory, so the Company continually evaluates the recoverability based on assumptions about customer demand and market
	conditions. The evaluation may take into consideration historical usage, expected demand, anticipated sales price, new product
	development schedules, the effect new products might have on the sale of existing products, product obsolescence, customer concentrations,
	and other factors. The write-down is equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based
	upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions. If actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected
	by management, additional inventory write-downs may be required that could negatively impact the Group&rsquo;s gross margin and
	operating results. If actual market conditions are more favorable, the Company may have higher gross margin when products that
	have been previously written down are eventually sold.

	For a sale-leaseback transaction, an analysis is performed
	to determine if the Company can record a sale and remove the assets from the balance sheet and recognize the lease; and if so,
	to determine whether to record the lease as either an operating or capital lease. If the Company has continued involvement beyond
	a normal lease, the lease is accounted for as a capital lease transaction and the assets and related financing obligation are recognized
	on the balance sheet.&nbsp; The Company&rsquo;s assets under the capital lease transaction were derecognized upon sale at the net
	book value and rebooked at the financed amount; and the differences between the net book value derecognized and the rebooked financed
	amount of the assets were deferred and amortized over the lease term. Accordingly, the asset is depreciated over its estimated
	useful life in accordance with the Company&rsquo;s policy.

	Long-lived assets, such as property, plant, and equipment

	intends to designate as a hedge of a forecasted transaction or the variability of cash flows to be received or paid related to
	a recognized asset or liability (cash flow hedge). For all hedging relationships, the Company formally documents the hedging relationship
	and its risk management objective and strategy for undertaking the hedge, the hedging instrument, the hedged transaction, the nature
	of the risk being hedged, how the hedging instrument&rsquo;s effectiveness in offsetting the hedged risk will be assessed prospectively
	and retrospectively, and a description of the method used to measure ineffectiveness. The Company also formally assesses, both
	at the inception of the hedging relationship and on an ongoing basis, whether the derivatives that are used in hedging relationships
	are highly effective in offsetting changes in cash flows of hedged transactions. For derivative instruments that are designated
	and qualify as part of a cash flow hedging relationship, the effective portion of the gain or loss on the derivative is reported
	as a component of other comprehensive income and reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods during which the hedged
	transaction affects earnings. Gains and losses on the derivative representing either hedge ineffectiveness or hedge components
	excluded from the assessment of effectiveness are recognized in current earnings.&nbsp; The maximum term over which the Company
	is hedging exposures to the variability of cash flows for forecasted transaction is 12 months.

	2011, the Company implemented a new and improved warranty terms for multicrystalline PV module that guarantees 91.2% and 80.7%
	of initial power generation capacity for 10 years and 25 years, respectively.&nbsp;Further, in respect of monocrystalline Panda

	In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue
	from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) (&quot;ASU 2014-09&quot;). ASU 2014-09 supersedes the revenue recognition requirements
	in ASC Topic 605, Revenue Recognition, and most industry-specific guidance. The core principle of the guidance is that an entity
	should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration
	to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The new standard will require the Company to
	separate performance obligations within a contract, determine total transaction costs, and ultimately allocate the transaction
	costs across the established performance obligations. In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-14, &quot;Revenue from Contracts
	with Customers&quot; (Topic 606): Deferral of the Effective Date, which delays the effective date of ASU 2014-09 by one year. As
	a result, ASU 2014-09 will become effective for the Company beginning in fiscal 2018 under either full or modified retrospective
	adoption, with early adoption permitted as of the original effective date of ASU 2014-09. The Company is currently assessing the
	potential significant effects of these changes on the Company's consolidated financial statements.

	In February 2015, the FASB issued the ASU 2015-02,
	&quot;Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis&quot;. The objective of issuing the amendments in this Update is to change the analysis
	that a reporting entity must perform to determine whether it should consolidate certain types of legal entities. The amendments
	in this Update are an improvement to current US GAAP because they simplify the Codification and reduce the number of consolidation
	models through the elimination of the indefinite deferral of Statement 167 and because they place more emphasis on risk of loss
	when determining a controlling financial interest. The amendments in this Update are effective for public business entities for
	fiscal years, and for interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2015. Early adoption is permitted,
	including adoption in an interim period. If an entity early adopts the amendments in an interim period, any adjustments should
	be reflected as of the beginning of the fiscal year that includes that interim period. A reporting entity may apply the amendments
	in this Update using a modified retrospective approach by recording a cumulative-effect adjustment to equity as of the beginning
	of the fiscal year of adoption. A reporting entity also may apply the amendments retrospectively. The Company plans to apply this
	standard beginning in 2016 and does not expect this guidance to have a material impact on the Company&rsquo;s consolidated financial
	statements.

	In April 2015, the FASB issued the ASU No. 2015-03,
	Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs (&quot;ASU 2015-03&quot;), which changes the presentation of debt issuance
	costs in financial statements. Under ASU 2015-03, an entity will present such costs in the balance sheet as a direct deduction
	from the related debt liability rather than as an asset. Amortization of the costs will continue to be reported as interest expense.
	In August 2015, the FASB issued the ASU No. 2015-15&mdash;Presentation and Subsequent Measurement of Debt Issuance Costs Associated
	with Line-of-Credit Arrangements (&quot;ASU 2015-15&quot;), which incorporates the SEC staff's announcement that clarifies the
	exclusion of line-of-credit arrangements from the scope of ASU 2015-03. The ASU clarifies that debt issuance costs related to line-of-credit
	arrangements can be deferred and presented as an asset that is subsequently amortized over the time of the line-of-credit arrangement,
	regardless of whether there are any outstanding borrowings on the line-of-credit arrangement. ASU 2015-03 is effective retrospectively
	for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2015. The Company is currently assessing the potential significant
	effects of these changes on the Company's consolidated financial statements. As of December 31, 2015, the total balance of deferred
	debt issuance cost included in &ldquo;Prepaid expenses and other current assets&rdquo; was RMB1,595 (US$ 246) .

	In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-06, Contingent
	Put and Call Options in Debt Instruments. The amendments in this Update apply to all entities that are issuers of or investors
	in debt instruments (or hybrid financial instruments that are determined to have a debt host) with embedded call (put) options.
	The Amendments in this Update clarify the requirements for assessing whether contingent call (put) options that can accelerate
	the payment of principal on debt instruments are clearly and closely related to their debt hosts, which is one of the criteria
	for bifurcating an embedded derivative. An entity performing the assessment under the amendments in this Update is required to
	assess the embedded call (put) options solely in accordance with the four-step decision sequence. Consequently, when a call (put)
	option is contingently exercisable, an entity does not have to assess whether the event that triggers the ability to exercise a
	call (put) option is related to interest rates or credit risks. The amendments are an improvement to GAAP because they eliminate
	diversity in practice in assessing embedded contingent call (put) options in debt instruments. For public companies, the amendments
	in this Update are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within those fiscal
	years. An entity should apply the amendments in this Update on a modified retrospective basis to existing debt instruments as of

	In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-07, Simplifying

	investor must adjust the investment, results of operations, and retained earnings retroactively on a step-by-step basis as if the

	the equity method of accounting recognize through earnings the unrealized holding gain or loss in accumulated other comprehensive

	As part of its ongoing control procedures, management
	monitors the creditworthiness of its customers to which it grants credit terms in the normal course of business. Credit terms are
	normally four months from the date of billing. For certain customers the Company requires an advance payment before the sale is
	made.&nbsp;Such advance payments are reported as &ldquo;advances from customers&rdquo; in the Company&rsquo;s consolidated balance
	sheets and amounted to RMB 935,935 and RMB 725,170 (US$ 111,947) as of December&nbsp;31, 2014 and 2015, respectively.&nbsp;The
	Company also requires certain customers to secure payment by a letter of credit issued by the customers&rsquo; banks.&nbsp;Letters
	of credit have terms less than 90 days. Until the letter of credit is drawn and the amount is paid, the amount due from the customer
	is recorded as accounts receivable. As of December&nbsp;31, 2014 and 2015, 51.5% and 33.5%, respectively, of accounts receivable

	No impairment for property, plant and equipment
	was recognized in 2013 and 2014. Due to the significant decrease in shipment, gross profit margins and lower-than-expected
	utilization of production facilities, the Company determined a two-step impairment analysis was required in the middle of
	2015. In step one impairment analysis, the estimated future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the
	assets over their remaining estimated useful lives were based on certain assumptions, such as forecasts of future operating
	results, gross margin and expected future growth rates. The estimated undiscounted future cash flows generated by the
	equipment used to produce solar products were less than their carrying value, which required the step two impairment test. In
	the step two impairment analysis, the Company estimated the fair value based on discounted cash flow analysis using market
	participants&rsquo; assumptions, such as forecasts of future operating results, discount rates commensurate with the risk
	involved, and expected future growth rates. The carrying value of the equipment was reduced to fair value based on the
	discounted cash flow analysis. As a result, an impairment loss of RMB 3,804,116 (US$587,254) related to buildings, machinery and
	equipment and shared assets in all solar production lines (including production lines of ingot, wafer, cell and module), was
	provided for the year ended December 31, 2015.

	The Company&rsquo;s principal operating subsidiaries, Hainan Yingli New Energy Resources Co., Ltd. (&ldquo;Hainan
	Yingli&rdquo;) and Yingli Energy (China) Co., Ltd. (&ldquo;Yingli China&rdquo;) are located in the PRC with the Renminbi being
	their functional currency, respectively. However, the majority of these two entity&rsquo;s sales are in currencies other than Renminbi,
	primarily the EURO and US$. Any depreciation of the EURO or US$ against the Renminbi will generally result in foreign exchange
	losses and adversely affect the Company&rsquo;s results of operations. With an aim to reduce its risk exposure, the Company, on
	a selected basis, enters into forward contracts with financial institutions to forward sell EURO or US$ when it entered into certain
	sales contracts denominated in EURO or US$ through its PRC operating subsidiaries. Some of these foreign currency forward contracts
	are qualified as foreign currency cash flow hedges at inception, and thus the change in the fair value of these hedge contracts
	were initially recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income and reclassified into the consolidated statements of comprehensive
	loss in the period that the sale of the related hedged item is recognized or when hedge accounting is discontinued if the foreign
	currency forward contracts are no longer effective in offsetting cash flows attributable to the hedged risk. During the year ended
	December 31, 2013, the Company entered into foreign currency forward contracts with a notional amount of EURO 100,690 and US$ 7,000
	against its EURO and US$ denominated sales, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2014, the Company entered into foreign
	currency forward contracts with a notional amount of EURO 31,760, US$ 27,000 and JPY 2,499,200 against its EURO ,US$ and JPY denominated
	sales, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2015, the Company entered into foreign currency forward contracts with
	a notional amount of EURO 80,000, US$ 30,000 and JPY 7,100,000 against its EURO ,US$ and JPY denominated sales, respectively. As
	of December 31, 2014 and 2015, the Company had outstanding foreign currency forward contracts with notional amounts of EURO 3,780

	The Company&rsquo;s exposure to the risk of changes
	in market interest rates primarily relates to its bank borrowings. To finance its business operation and expansion, the Company&rsquo;s
	PRC operating subsidiaries will obtain short-term and long-term bank borrowings. Some of the bank borrowings carry variable interest
	rates. Interest expenses on these banking borrowings may increase as a result of change in market interest rates. With an aim to
	reduce its interest rate exposure, the Company entered into one long-term interest rate swap contract, with notional amount of
	US$70,000, in 2009. As of December 31, 2014 and 2015, the Company didn&rsquo;t have outstanding interest rate swap contracts.

	of JPY 395,000 (RMB 20,580 equivalent, US$ 3,177) to Yingli Japan, which was treated as a capital injection, meanwhile, the other
	two investors made also made capital injection to SPC. After the transaction was made, total investment by Yingli Japan was amounted
	to JPY 546,500 and equity interest owned by Yingli Japan decreased to 37.5%. In July 2015, Yingli Japan together with other two
	investors of SPC, entered into several agreement to transfer 100% of equity interest of SPC to another entity unrelated to the
	Company. Based on the agreements, consideration of 37.5% of equity interest of SPC owned by Yingli Japan was JPY1,287,600 (RMB
	67,086 equivalent). The consideration was based on the fair value of SPC. As of December 31, 2015, due to that the share transfer
	has not completed, partial consideration of PY 815,700 (RMB42,499 equivalent) received was recorded in &ldquo;Other current liabilities

	Tianwei Yingli to issue RMB-denominated unsecured five-year medium-term notes in two tranches on the PRC inter-bank debenture market.
	The First Tranche Issue with RMB 1,000,000 was completed on October&nbsp;13, 2010 and matured on October&nbsp;13, 2015. Tianwei
	Yingli had an option to call the notes at the end of the third year from issuance. Upon exercise of the call option, the re-purchase
	amount equals to the par value of the notes plus any unpaid interest. The First Tranche bore a fixed annual interest rate of 4.3%
	per annum in the first three years, and increased to 5.7% per annum in the remaining two years as Tianwei Yingli chose not to call

	*Prior to FY 2014, Baoding Tianwei Baobian Electric
	Co.,&nbsp;Ltd. (&ldquo;Tianwei Baobian&rdquo;), a third party, held 25.99% equity interest in Tianwei Yingli. In May&nbsp;2014,
	the Company, Baoding Tianwei Group Co.,&nbsp;Ltd.(&ldquo; Tianwei Group&rdquo;), and Tianwei Baobian entered into a new joint venture
	contract and Tianwei Baobian transferred 7% equity interest in Tianwei Yingli to Tianwei Group. Under a Sino-foreign equity joint
	venture company contract with Tianwei Baobian and Tianwei Group, it provides that Tianwei Baobian and/or Tianwei Group will have
	a right to swap the shares of the Company with the all but not part shares of the non-controlling interest in Tianwei Yingli. The
	terms of the swap will be discussed separately at the time of the swap. The Company does not account for such share swap until
	a separate agreement is signed that clearly states the terms and basis of the share swap between the non-controlling shareholders
	and the Company. Tianwei Baobian and/or Tianwei Group may exercise this subscription right after certain conditions are satisfied
	following the completion of the Company&rsquo;s IPO. Tianwei Baobian and/or Tianwei Group&rsquo;s subscription rights to subscribe
	for newly issued ordinary shares of the Company in exchange for all but not part of Tianwei Baobian and/or Tianwei Group&rsquo;s
	equity interest in Tianwei Yingli did not have an effect on earnings per share as these rights are contingent upon Tianwei Baobian
	and/or Tianwei Group obtaining all necessary approvals from relevant PRC government authorities for acquiring our ordinary shares
	in the future. As of December&nbsp;31, 2015, Tianwei Baobian and/or Tianwei Group haven&rsquo;t exercised this subscription right.

	Until the third quarter of 2008, an
	industry-wide shortage of high purity polysilicon coupled with growing demand for PV modules caused the increases of
	polysilicon prices. In order to ensure the adequate supply of polysilicon, the Company entered into several long-term fixed
	price supply contracts from 2006 to 2011 under which the polysilicon would be delivered from 2009 to 2020. However, from the
	second quarter of 2011, the polysilicon price has decreased significantly as the result of increased polysilicon
	manufacturing capacity and the pressure from the decreasing average selling price of PV modules. As a result, the Company
	recognized a provision of RMB 851,694 on its firm purchase commitments under the long-term fixed price polysilicon contracts
	as of December 31, 2011. The provision was determined by applying a methodology similar to that used in the lower of cost or
	market evaluation with respect to inventory. During the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2012, notwithstanding that the firm
	purchase commitments under the long-term fixed price contracts continued to be in effect, through negotiations with the
	vendors the Company was able to obtain various pricing concessions from the vendors which resulted in the actual purchase
	price paid by the Company to be less than the stated contract price. The Company has therefore reclassified the accrual for
	potential losses on inventory firm purchase commitments of RMB 851,694 as of December 31, 2012 to an accrual for loss
	contingency related to the inventory purchase commitments.

	During the year ended December 31, 2013, the
	Company continued to negotiate and execute amendments for current purchases on a monthly or quarterly basis with Supplier B
	and Supplier C(refer to note (2)(c)) and obtained price concessions that allowed the Company to purchase polysilicon at
	renegotiated prices that were in line with the market price and significantly lower than the stated contract prices under the
	long-term fixed price supply contracts with these vendors. In addition, the Company continued to negotiate with these
	Supplier B and Supplier C for an overall amendment to each long-term fixed price supply contract with such vendors to
	eliminate fixed price arrangements. In October 2013, the Company entered into agreements with Supplier B to amend the
	contract and include a price adjustment mechanism that allows the Company and the vendor to renegotiate purchase price on a
	quarterly basis within a specified price range set forth in the amendments based on market price. The Company has not reached
	similar agreement with Supplier C, but continued to renegotiate prices on a quarterly or monthly basis to purchase at close
	to market prices. The Company failed however, to purchase from Supplier C the stated quantities for a total of six months in
	2012 and 2013 under the long-term fixed price supply contracts as the Company&rsquo;s management determined after taking into
	consideration all relevant factors that it would be in the Company&rsquo;s best interest not to accept those deliveries when
	they were due. As a result, because the contract has been substantially executed, Supplier C claimed that the Company had
	forfeited certain advance payments made by the Company (see below for discussion of provision recorded in 2013 against these
	advances). Notwithstanding the Company&rsquo;s failure to accept deliveries for six months and Supplier C&rsquo;s claim as
	described above, the Company and Supplier C continued their monthly or quarterly negotiations and the Company has

	In connection with the preparation of
	the Company&rsquo;s consolidated financial statements for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2013, management reassessed the
	loss contingency under the long-term fixed price polysilicon contracts taking into account the developments described above
	as well as considerations related to the more recent long-term fixed price polysilicon contracts with another supplier,
	Supplier A, the Company recognized an additional provision of RMB 393,048 on the firm purchase commitments under the
	long-term fixed price polysilicon contracts as of December&nbsp;31, 2013.&nbsp; The provision was determined by applying a
	methodology similar to that used in the lower of cost or market evaluation with respect to inventory, using
	management&rsquo;s best estimates of future purchase prices over the remaining terms of the contracts and applying such
	estimated purchase prices in the lower of cost or market evaluation.&nbsp; In estimating the renegotiated purchase prices,
	the Company considered the pertinent terms of each of the long-term supply contracts, the history and progress of
	renegotiation with the relevant vendors and the actual price concessions granted, the polysilicon market development based on
	available industry research data and the likelihood of achieving different levels of renegotiated prices for future
	periods.&nbsp; In addition to the estimated renegotiated purchase price, certain other key assumptions were used in measuring
	the loss accrual, which included but were not limited to (i)&nbsp;the estimated net realizable value of the PV modules
	manufactured from the polysilicon expected to be purchased under the long-term supply contracts; and (ii)&nbsp;the normal
	profit margin of the PV modules for purposes of estimating the replacement cost or market price under the lower of cost or
	market evaluation. The Company also considered the quantities that were required to be purchased and amounts due on take or
	pay arrangements, as well as the history and progress of renegotiation with the relevant vendors and the actual concessions
	granted in developing the amount of the estimated loss contingencies.

	In 2015, after management&rsquo;s assessment by using
	same methodology mentioned above, no additional contingency losses for inventory firm purchase commitment with Supplier A was determined
	to be required in 2015. However, due to significant fluctuation in the foreign exchange rates between the RMB and US$ and given
	that the inventory purchase commitment to Supplier A is dominated in US dollar, which is different from the related entities&rsquo;
	functional currency, a foreign exchange re-measurement loss of RMB 77,705 (US$ 11,996) was recorded as additional provision and
	was recorded in &ldquo;Provision for reserve for inventory purchase commitments&rdquo;. No such provision was needed in 2014 since
	the foreign exchange rate was stable and the provision caused by the foreign exchange rate fluctuation was immaterial.

	In entering into its inventory purchase
	contracts with Supplier A, the Company made prepayments as described in note 2(c). As of December 31, 2014 and 2015, total
	balance of prepayments made to Supplier A was RMB 224,029 (US$34,584). In 2014 and 2015, due to the anti-dumping duty and
	anti-subsidy investigation against Solar-Grade Polysilicon launched by the Ministry of Commerce of the People&rsquo;s
	Republic of China, the Company did not make any purchases from the Supplier A under the above-mentioned long-term fixed price
	supply contract, which was entered into in 2011 and was effective from 2013 to 2020. The Company received invoices from
	Supplier A under its take-or-pay obligation for failing to take the shipments from 2013 to 2015 and is currently in
	discussion with the Supplier A to seek an acceptable solution to both parties in accordance with the long-term supply
	contract. According to the long-term supply contracts entered into between the Company and Supplier A, the minimum purchase
	amount approximates US$1.6 billion in total. The Company believes that, it is probable the Company will execute
	the agreements due to the &ldquo;take or pay&rdquo; obligation, which requires the Company to pay full amount to Supplier
	A according to the purchase and payment schedule listed in the agreements with Supplier A, regardless of whether the
	Company actually purchases raw materials from Supplier A. In addition, the Company also believes that based upon the status
	of the negotiations with Supplier A, as of December 31, 2014 and 2015, it is reasonably assured that i) these prepayments are
	not legally forfeited; ii) these prepayments could be utilized for deliveries once the Company starts purchasing from
	Supplier A. As a result, the Company believes that the total these prepayments could be utilized for deliveries once the
	Company starts purchasing from Supplier A, therefore there was no need to make a reserve against the prepayments to Supplier
	A in either 2014 or 2015.

	As described in note 2(c), the Company also has
	prepayments with respect to another supplier, Supplier C, for the purchase of polysilicon. In 2015, the Company failed to
	purchase from Supplier C the stated quantities under the long-term fixed price supply contracts as the Company&rsquo;s
	management determined after taking into consideration all relevant factors that it would be in the Company&rsquo;s best
	interest not to accept those deliveries when they were due (In 2014, the Company purchased the required amounts of
	polysilicon from Supplier C and utilized the portion of prepayments related to 2014). As a result, because the contract has
	been substantially executed, the vendor claimed that certain advance payments had been forfeited.&nbsp;Unlike the take or pay
	obligation for Supplier A described in Note 18(a), if the Company fails to take the full amount of the agreed annual quantity
	in any calendar year, the Company does not have to pay for the remaining annual commitment, but rather only forfeits the
	unutilized portion of the prepayment related to that year. Further, the Company does not have the right to utilize this
	prepayment for deliveries in the following years. For years ended December 31, 2013, 2014 and 2015, impairment provided against the forfeited advance

	In late 2015, the Company contracted with several
	vendors to allow them to operate certain of the Company&rsquo;s polysilicon ingot and wafer production facilities with a term
	of one year. These vendors pay the Company a monthly fee to operate these production facilities, reimburse the Company the salaries
	of the Company&rsquo;s staff members employed at such facilities and utilities incurred for the operation of the facilities, and
	cover all other manner of operating, ancillary, and raw material expenses of such production. As part of the arrangement, the
	Company agrees to purchase all of the wafers so produced by the vendors. For the year ended December 31, 2015, total amounts received
	for the use of the production facilities and the reimbursements of the salaries of the Company&rsquo;s staff members employed
	at such facilities and utilities incurred for the operation of the facilities were RMB 180million (US$ 28million). Considering

	In assessing the realization of deferred income tax

	periods in which those temporary differences become deductible.&nbsp;Management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax
	liabilities (including the impact of available carryforward periods), projected future taxable income, and tax planning strategies

	As of December 31, 2014, the Company recognized net deferred income tax assets of RMB665,644, primarily
	relate to the tax benefits of (i) RMB199,782 in provision for inventory purchase commitment, which expire in varying amounts upon
	the settlement of the contingency on the long term purchase commitment provision with the major polysilicon suppliers; (ii) RMB428,790

	provision with the major polysilicon suppliers, a full allowance was provided due to that the Company believes it is more likely

	For each of the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2013,
	2014 and 2015, the Company did not have any unrecognized tax benefits and thus no interest and penalties related to unrecognized
	tax benefits were recorded.&nbsp;In addition, the Company does not expect that the amount of unrecognized tax benefits will change
	significantly within the next 12 months. According to the PRC Tax Administration and Collection Law, the statute of limitations
	is three years if the underpayment of taxes is due to computational errors made by the taxpayer or the withholding agent.&nbsp;The
	statute of limitations is extended to five years under special circumstances where the underpayment of taxes is more than RMB 100

	On December&nbsp;28, 2006, the Company adopted the
	2006 Stock Incentive Plan (the &ldquo;Plan&rdquo;).&nbsp;The Plan provides for both the granting of stock options and other stock-based
	awards such as restricted shares to key employees, directors and consultants of the Company. The Plan was subsequently amended
	by the Company&rsquo;s board of directors and shareholders to increase the number of ordinary shares that the Company is authorized
	to issue. The amendment did not change any other provisions of 2006 Stock Incentive Plan. As of December&nbsp;31, 2015, the Company
	was authorized to issue 12,745,438 shares under the 2006 Stock Incentive Plan. Among these shares, up to 2,715,243 shares may be
	issued for the purposes of granting awards of unvested shares and up to 10,030,195 shares may be issued for the purpose of granting
	stock option.

	From July&nbsp;2009 through March&nbsp;2013, the Company
	signed several agreements and amendments with a supplier to provide recovery service of exhausted slurry for the Company.&nbsp;According
	to the series of agreements and amendments with the supplier, the Company guaranteed a minimum annual supply volume of exhausted
	slurry.&nbsp;Starting from late 2011, due to certain quality control issues related to the supplier and substantial changes in
	the slurry processing market, we and this supplier had disputes over the performance of the supply contracts and payments of accounts
	receivable.&nbsp;In May&nbsp;2013, the supplier informed the Company that it would like to cease the recovery service and claimed
	compensation. In July 2014, the Company filed litigation against this supplier for breach of contract and claimed damages against
	this supplier.&nbsp;In September 2015, the supplier also filed litigation against the Company for the default in performance of
	contract and claimed compensation. The court consolidated these two disputes in January 2016, in accordance with the Company&rsquo;s
	request. While it is premature at this stage to evaluate the final outcome, the Company believes that the supplier&rsquo;s claims
	lack merits.&nbsp;In accordance with ASC Topic 450, no accrual of loss contingency was accrued as of December&nbsp;31, 2015 since

	In October&nbsp;2013, the Company received notice of

	alleges a wide-ranging conspiracy among the Company and other two Chinese photovoltaic panel manufacturers, their suppliers, banks
	and the Chinese government to destroy ECD and the U.S. solar industry by flooding the market with cheap photovoltaic panels.&nbsp;On
	October&nbsp;31, 2014, the Court granted our joint motion to dismiss the case. In November 2014, the plaintiff filed a motion for
	reconsideration and a second motion to amend or alter the judgement and for leave to file an amended complaint, both of which were
	denied by the Court in September 2015. ECD has appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, and that appeal remains
	pending. While it is premature at this stage of the litigations to evaluate the likelihood of favorable or unfavorable outcomes,
	we believe that ECD&rsquo;s claims lack merits. We intend to defend vigorously against those allegations. In accordance with ASC

	In May and June 2015, two individual plaintiffs respectively
	filed purported class action securities fraud lawsuits against us, our chairperson and chief executive officer, Mr. Liansheng Mao,
	and the Company&rsquo;s director and chief executive officer, Mr. Yiyu Wang, in the U.S. District Court for the Central District
	of California, both alleging, among other things, that the Company made false and misleading statements and failed to disclose
	certain material financial information. In October 2015, the cases were consolidated and the court appointed lead plaintiffs and
	lead counsel. In November 2015, lead plaintiffs filed a consolidated amended complaint. The amended complaint contends that we
	and certain of our officers and directors made false or misleading statements between December 2, 2010 and May 15, 2015 regarding
	(i) the Chinese government&rsquo;s Golden Sun program, which provided subsidies for solar projects in China; and (ii) the Company&rsquo;s
	accounts receivable attributable to Chinese customers. The sole claim against the Company is for violation of Section 10(b) of
	the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. In December 2015, the Company filed a motion to dismiss the consolidated suit. Plaintiffs
	filed an opposition to the motion on January 15, 2016, and we filed a reply on January 29, 2016. The court heard oral argument

	contingency was accrued as of December&nbsp;31, 2015 since it is not probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount
	of loss cannot be reasonably estimated.

	In October 2012, the Company received notice of an
	antitrust and unfair competition lawsuit filed by Solyndra, LLC (&ldquo;Solyndra&rdquo;, a U.S.-based solar company) against the
	Company and two other China-based photovoltaic panel manufacturers in the U.S. District Court of the Northern District of California.
	The Company filed its joint motion to dismiss all of Solyndra&rsquo;s claims with the co-defendants in March 2013. On April 9,
	2014, the Company received an order denying defendants&rsquo; joint motion to dismiss Solyndra&rsquo;s claims. In February 2016,
	the Company entered into an agreement to settle these claims (&ldquo;the Settlement Agreement&rdquo;). According to the Settlement
	Agreement, i) the Company together with Yingli Green Energy Americas, Inc. (&ldquo;Yingli Americas&rdquo;, one subsidiaries of
	the Company), shall pay US$7.5 million to settle Solyndra&rsquo;s claims; ii) the Company shall be obligated to pay to Solyndra
	additional cash of US$10 million, if the annual total sales of PV modules from the Company and its subsidiaries to the United States
	and Canada equals or exceeds 800 megawatts in any single calendar year from 2016 to 2018. The aforementioned lawsuit against the
	Company will be dismissed with prejudice, and under the Settlement Agreement, Solyndra has released the Company and all of its
	affiliates from any further claims based on the same or any related facts or allegations. This settlement is subject to approval
	by the bankruptcy court handling Solyndra&rsquo;s bankruptcy case. Therefore, provision of settlement fee of US$ 7.5 million (RMB
	48.7 million) has been provided as of December 31, 2015 and was recorded in &ldquo;Payables due to settlement of claims&rdquo;
	and &ldquo;General and administrative expenses&rdquo; to the &ldquo;Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Loss&rdquo;, no provision
	was made against the additional of US$10 million (RMB 64.8 million) since it is not probable that a liability has been incurred.

	The estimated fair values of short-term and long-term
	supply agreements were determined based on the present values of the after-tax cost savings of the Company&rsquo;s short-term and
	long-term supply agreements. The after-tax cost savings of the Company&rsquo;s short-term and long-term supply agreements were
	based on the difference of price of polysilicon between the agreed purchase price per the supply contracts and the forecasted spot
	market price at time of the forecasted inventory acquisition. The after-tax costs savings also considered the interest impact of
	making the pre-payments in accordance with the supply agreements payment terms. Management estimated the useful life of the short-term
	and long-term supply agreements based upon the contractual delivery periods specified in each agreement. The long-term supply agreements
	relate to four long-term polysilicon supply agreements with delivery period commencing in 2009.

	In accordance with Section 802.01C of the NYSE's Listed Company

	ADSs have a closing share price of at least $1.00 per ADS on the last trading day of any calendar month during the period and also
	have an average closing price of at least $1.00 per ADS over the 30 trading-day period ending on the last trading day of that month.
	The Company can also regain compliance if at the expiration of the six-month Cure Period, both a $1.00 or above closing price per

	of its American Depositary Shares (&ldquo;ADSs&rdquo;) to ordinary shares from one (1) ADS representing one (1) ordinary share

	business on December 28, 2015 was required to exchange every ten ADSs then held for one new ADS. The ratio change brought the Company
	back into compliance with all NYSE listing standards. The historical and present loss per share for the periods presented herein

	Relevant PRC laws and regulations permit PRC companies
	to pay dividends only out of their retained earnings. if any, as determined in accordance with PRC accounting standards and regulations.
	In addition, PRC companies can only distribute dividends upon approval of the shareholders after they have met the PRC requirements
	for appropriation to statutory reserves. Relevant rules require annual appropriations of 10% of net after-tax income to be set
	aside prior to payment of any dividends. As a result of these and other restrictions under PRC laws and regulations, the PRC subsidiaries
	are restricted in their ability to transfer a portion of their net assets to the Company either in the form of dividends, loans
	or advances, which restricted portion amounted to approximately RMB 9,493 million, or 202% of the Group&rsquo;s total consolidated
	net deficits as of December 31, 2015. Even though the Company currently does not require any such dividends, loans or advances
	from the PRC subsidiaries for working capital and other funding purposes, the Company may in the future require additional cash
	resources from the PRC subsidiaries due to changes in business conditions, to fund future acquisitions and developments, or merely
	declare and pay dividends to or distributions to the Company&rsquo;s shareholders.
