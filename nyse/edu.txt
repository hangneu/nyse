	The success of our business depends primarily on the number of student enrollments in our courses and the amount of course fees that our students are willing
	to pay. Therefore, our ability to continue to attract students to enroll in our courses without a significant decrease in course fees is critical to the continued success and growth of our business. This in turn will depend on several factors,
	including our ability to develop new programs and enhance existing programs to respond to changes in market trends and student demands, expand our geographic reach, manage our growth while maintaining the consistency of our teaching quality,
	effectively market our programs to a broader base of prospective students, develop and license additional high-quality educational content and respond to competitive pressures. If we are unable to continue to attract students to enroll in our
	courses without a significant decrease in course fees, our revenue may decline and we may not be able to maintain profitability.

	Our teachers are critical to maintaining the quality of our programs, services and products and
	maintaining our brand and reputation. It is critical for us to continue to attract qualified teachers who have a strong command of the subject areas to be taught and meet our qualification. We also need to hire teachers who are capable of delivering
	innovative and inspirational instruction. The number of teachers in China with the necessary experience and language proficiency to teach our courses is limited and we must provide competitive compensation packages to attract and retain qualified
	teachers. In addition, criteria such as commitment and dedication are difficult to ascertain during the recruitment process, in particular as we continue to expand and add teachers to meet rising student enrollments. We must also provide continuous
	training to our teachers so that they can stay up to date with changes in student demands, admissions and assessment tests, admissions standards and other key trends necessary to effectively teach their respective courses. We may not be able to
	hire, train and retain enough qualified teachers to keep pace with our anticipated growth while maintaining consistent teaching quality across many different schools, learning centers and programs in different geographic locations. Shortages of
	qualified teachers or decreases in the quality of our instruction, whether actual or perceived, in one or more of our markets may have a material and adverse effect on our business.

	Adverse publicity concerning our failure or perceived failure to comply with legal and regulatory requirements,

	allegations about us on July&nbsp;18, 2012, the trading price of our ADSs declined sharply and we were inundated by numerous investor inquiries. The negative publicity and the resulting decline of the trading price of our ADSs also led to the filing

	Our business could be materially and adversely affected by the outbreak of avian influenza, severe acute respiratory
	syndrome, or SARS, Ebola or other epidemics. For example, the influenza A (H1N1) outbreak from 2009 to 2010 adversely affected our business and results of operations in the first and second fiscal quarters of 2010 as we experienced slower-than-usual
	student enrollment growth and large numbers of cancellations and deferments in enrollments from registered students. In addition, we had to cancel classes whenever an enrolled student was diagnosed with influenza A (H1N1), as required by applicable
	health regulations. Starting from March 2013, H7N9 bird flu, a new strain of animal influenza, has been spreading in China and has infected more than a hundred people. While the spread of the avian virus H7N9 has not materially affected our student
	enrollments as of the date of this annual report, any future outbreak of avian influenza, SARS, the influenza A (H1N1), H7N9 bird flu or other adverse public health developments in China may have a material and adverse effect on our business
	operations. These occurrences could cause cancellations or deferments of student enrollments and require the temporary closure of our schools, learning centers and bookstores while we remain obligated to pay rent and other expenses for these
	facilities, thus severely disrupting our business operations and materially and adversely affecting our liquidity, financial condition and results of operations.

	continue to result, in substantial demands on our management, faculty and operational, technological and other resources. Our expansion will also place significant demands on us to maintain the consistency of our teaching quality and our culture to
	ensure that our brand does not suffer as a result of any decreases, whether actual or perceived, in our teaching quality. To manage and support our growth, we must continue to improve our existing operational, administrative and technological

	learning centers because we and/or our competitors already have extensive operations in these cities. In recently developed and developing cities, demand for our programs, services and products may not increase as rapidly as we expect. Furthermore,

	As part of our business strategy, we have pursued and intend to continue to pursue selective strategic
	acquisitions of businesses that complement our existing businesses. Acquisitions expose us to potential risks, including risks associated with the diversion of resources from our existing businesses, difficulties in successfully integrating the
	acquired businesses, failure to achieve expected growth by the acquired businesses and an inability to generate sufficient revenue to offset the costs and expenses of acquisitions. If the revenue and cost synergies that we expect to achieve from our
	acquisitions do not materialize, we may have to recognize impairment charges. For example, in September 2010, we completed the acquisition of a 100% equity interest in Newave Education, a K-12 English language school in Shanghai. Due to the breach
	of contract by the seller of Newave Education, we submitted a request for arbitration to the China International Economic and Trade Arbitration Commission for full refund of the purchase consideration which we had paid. The case was closed in
	December 2011, and we received the full refund by the end of the fiscal year ended May&nbsp;31, 2012.

	We may be subject to claims by educational institutions and organizations, content providers and publishers, competitors and others on the ground of
	intellectual property rights infringement, defamation, negligence or other legal theories based on the content of the materials that we or our teachers author and/or distribute as course materials. These types of claims have been brought, sometimes
	successfully, against print publications and educational institutions in the past, including ourselves. For example, in January 2001, the Graduate Management Admission Council, or GMAC, and Educational Testing Service, or ETS, filed three separate
	lawsuits against us in the Beijing No.&nbsp;1 Intermediate People&#146;s Court, alleging that we had violated the copyrights and trademarks relating to the GMAT test owned by GMAC and relating to the GRE and TOEFL tests owned by ETS by duplicating,
	selling and distributing their test materials without their authorization. In September 2003, the trial court found that we had violated GMAC&#146;s and ETS&#146; respective copyrights and trademarks in connection with those admissions tests. The
	trial court&#146;s judgment was partially affirmed in a final judgment issued by the Beijing Higher People&#146;s Court in December 2004. The Beijing Higher People&#146;s Court held that we had not misused the trademarks of GMAC or ETS. However, it
	also found that the TOEFL and GRE tests were the original works of ETS and the GMAT test was the original work of GMAC, all of which are protected under the PRC Copyright Law. The Beijing Higher People&#146;s Court held that our duplication, sale
	and distribution of the test materials relating to these tests without ETS&#146; and GMAC&#146;s prior permission were not a &#147;reasonable use&#148; of the test materials under the PRC Copyright Law, and that we, therefore, had infringed upon
	ETS&#146; and GMAC&#146;s respective copyrights. We were ordered to pay damages in an aggregate of approximately RMB6.5 million, cease all infringing activities and destroy all copyright-infringing materials in our possession, all of which we have
	done. Since the Beijing Higher People&#146;s Court issued the final judgment in 2004, we have endeavored to comply with the court order and applicable PRC laws and regulations relating to intellectual property, and we have adopted policies and
	procedures to prohibit our employees and contractors from engaging in any copyright, trademark or trade name infringing activities. However, we cannot assure you that every teacher or other personnel will strictly comply with these policies at our

	trade name infringement, particularly in China, is difficult, costly and time-consuming and continued unauthorized use of our trademarks and trade name by unrelated third parties may damage our reputation and brand. In addition, we have spent
	significant time and expense developing or licensing and localizing the content of certain educational materials, such as books, software, CD-ROMs, magazines and other periodicals, to enrich our product offerings and meet students&#146; needs. The
	measures we take to protect our trademarks, copyrights and other intellectual property rights, which presently are based upon a combination of trademark, copyright and trade secret laws, may not be adequate to prevent unauthorized use by third
	parties. Furthermore, the application of laws governing intellectual property rights in China and abroad is uncertain and evolving, and could involve substantial risks to us. If we are unable to adequately protect our trademarks, copyrights and

	The private

	For example, we face nationwide competition for our IELTS preparation courses from Global IELTS School, which offers IELTS preparation courses in many cities in China. We face regional competition for our English for children program from several
	competitors that focus on children&#146;s English training in specific regions, including English First. We face competition from companies that focus on providing international and/or PRC test preparation courses in specific geographic markets in

	use of the internet and advances in internet- and computer-related technologies, such as web video conferencing and online testing simulators, are eliminating geographic and cost-entry barriers to providing private educational services. As a result,
	many of our international competitors that offer online test preparation and language training courses may be able to more effectively penetrate the China market. Many of these international competitors have strong education brands, and students and

	Admissions and assessment tests undergo continuous change, in terms of the focus of the subjects and
	questions tested, the format of the tests and the manner in which the tests are administered. For example, certain admissions and assessment tests in the United States now include an essay component, which required us to hire and train teachers to
	be able to analyze written essays that tend to be more subjective in nature and require a higher level of English proficiency. In addition, some admissions and assessment tests that were previously offered in paper format only are now offered in a
	computer-based testing format. These changes require us to continually update and enhance our test preparation materials and our teaching methods. Further, the Chinese Ministry of Education, or the MOE, promulgated new curriculum standards on
	December&nbsp;28, 2011 for primary and secondary schools in China covering 19 subjects, including mathematics, Chinese and English. These new curriculum standards took effect in the fall semester of 2012, and we finished adapting our tutoring
	programs and materials to these changes in curriculum standards in July 2013. In September 2014, the government announced plans to change policies relating to the gaokao, or college entrance exam, that will change the format of English exam in the
	coming years. In December 2014, the MOE issued the Implementation Opinions on Scholastic Standard Test of Senior Secondary Schools and the Opinions on Strengthening and Improving the Comprehensive Aptitude Assessment of High School Students, both of
	which reform the policies relating to the college entrance exam, including but not limited to the subject, format and content of the exam. These policies will be implemented on a province-by-province basis and some provinces such as Beijing,
	Shanghai, Zhejiang have promulgated relevant regulations on reformation of the college entrance exam. Any inability to track and respond to these changes in a timely and cost-effective manner would make our programs, services and products less
	attractive to students, which may materially and adversely affect our reputation and ability to continue to attract students without a significant decrease in course fees.

	We provide preparation courses for both overseas and domestic admissions and assessment tests. The success of our test preparation courses depends on the
	continued use of admissions and assessment tests as a requirement for admission or graduation. However, the use of admissions tests in China may decline or fall out of favor with educational institutions and government authorities. For example,
	educational institutions and government authorities in China have recently initiated discussions and conducted early experiments in China on school admissions. Generally, these discussions and experiments exhibit a trend of basing admissions
	decisions less on entrance exam scores and more on a combination of other factors, such as past academic record, extracurricular activities and comprehensive aptitude evaluations. There have been certain changes in some geographic areas in the way
	the high school entrance exam is administered. If the use of admissions tests in China declines or falls out of favor with educational institutions and government authorities and if we fail to respond to these changes, the demand for certain of our

	Many factors may cause our gross and net margins to decline. For example, there is a recent trend that the short-term language training and test preparation
	markets are moving towards smaller class sizes, especially for students between the ages of 5 and 12. This may have resulted from discretionary income increases for families in China, which cause students to be more willing and able to pay higher
	course fees for the more individualized attention that smaller classes can offer. The average class size for our short-term language training and test preparation courses started to decrease since the fiscal year ended May&nbsp;31, 2009. In our
	fiscal year ended May&nbsp;31, 2016, the average class size was approximately eight students per class, compared to approximately 30 students per class for fiscal year ended May&nbsp;31, 2009. Although our smaller-sized classes are highly
	profitable, they are marginally less profitable on average than our large classes. In addition, new investments and acquisitions may cause our margins to decline before we successfully integrate the acquired businesses into our operations and
	realize the full benefits of these investments and acquisitions. There is a risk that our margins could continue to decline in the future due to these factors.

	We have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, seasonal fluctuations in our revenues and results of operations, primarily due to seasonal changes
	in student enrollments. Historically, our courses tend to have the largest student enrollments in our first fiscal quarter, which runs from June&nbsp;1 to August&nbsp;31 of each year, primarily because many students enroll in our courses during the
	summer vacation to enhance their foreign language skills and/or prepare for admissions and assessment tests in subsequent school terms. In addition, we have generally experienced larger student enrollments in our third fiscal quarter, which runs
	from December&nbsp;1 to February&nbsp;28 of each year, primarily because many students enroll in our language training and other courses during the winter school holidays. However, our expenses vary, and certain of our expenses do not necessarily

	Historically, our core businesses have been English language training for adults and test preparation courses for college and graduate students. We have

	restrictions. However, if any disputes arise between any of our senior executives or key personnel and us, it may be difficult to successfully pursue legal actions against these individuals because of the uncertainties of China&#146;s legal systems.

	PRC laws and regulations currently require any foreign entity that invests in the education business in China to be an educational institution with relevant
	experience in providing educational services outside China. Our offshore holding companies are not educational institutions and do not provide educational services outside China. In addition, in the PRC, foreign ownership of high schools for

	China. We conduct substantially all of our education business in China through a series of contractual arrangements with New Oriental China and its schools and subsidiaries and New Oriental China&#146;s shareholder. These contractual arrangements

	It is uncertain whether any new PRC laws, rules or regulations relating to variable interest entity structures will be adopted or if adopted,
	what they would provide. In particular, in January 2015, the Ministry of Commerce published a discussion draft of the proposed Foreign Investment Law for public review and comments. Among other things, the draft Foreign Investment Law expands the
	definition of foreign investment and introduces the principle of &#147;actual control&#148; in determining whether a company is considered a foreign-invested enterprise. Under the draft Foreign Investment Law, variable interest entities would also
	be deemed as foreign-invested enterprises if they are ultimately &#147;controlled&#148; by foreign investors, and be subject to restrictions on foreign investments. However, the draft law has not taken a position on what actions will be taken with
	respect to the existing companies with the &#147;variable interest entity&#148; structure, whether or not these companies are controlled by Chinese parties. It is uncertain when the draft would be signed into law and whether the final version would
	have any substantial changes from the draft. See &#147;Risks Related to Doing Business in China&#151;Substantial uncertainties exist with respect to the enactment timetable, final content, interpretation and implementation of draft PRC Foreign
	Investment Law published for public comments and how it may impact the viability of our current corporate structure, corporate governance and business operations.&#148;

	Pursuant to the equity pledge agreements among New Oriental China, Century
	Friendship and five of our wholly-owned subsidiaries in China, Century Friendship, as New Oriental China&#146;s sole shareholder, agrees to pledge its equity interests in New Oriental China to our subsidiaries to secure New Oriental China&#146;s and
	its schools and subsidiaries&#146; performance of their obligations under the relevant contractual arrangements. The equity pledges of Century Friendship under these equity pledge agreements have been registered with the relevant local branch of the
	State Administration for Industry and Commerce, or SAIC. According to the PRC Property Law and PRC Guarantee Law, the pledgee and the pledgor are prohibited from making an agreement prior to the expiration of the debt performance period to transfer
	the ownership of the pledged equity to the pledgee when the obligor fails to pay the debt due. However, under the PRC Property Law, when an obligor fails to pay its debt when due, the pledgee may choose to either conclude an agreement with the
	pledgor to obtain the pledged equity or seek payments from the proceeds of the auction or sell-off of the pledged equity. If New Oriental China or its shareholder fails to perform its obligations secured by the pledges under the equity pledge
	agreements, one remedy in the event of default under the agreements is to require the pledgor to sell the equity interests of New Oriental China in an auction or private sale and remit the proceeds to our wholly-owned subsidiaries in China, net of
	related taxes and expenses. Such an auction or private sale may not result in our receipt of the full value of the equity interests in New Oriental China. We consider it very unlikely that the public auction process would be undertaken since, in an
	event of default, our preferred approach is to ask Shanghai Smart Words Software Technology Co., Ltd., or Shanghai Smart Words, which is one of our PRC wholly-owned subsidiaries and a party to the option agreement with New Oriental China&#146;s
	shareholder, to designate another PRC person or entity to replace the existing shareholder of New Oriental China pursuant to the direct transfer option we have under the option agreement.

	In addition, in the registration forms of the local branch of State Administration for Industry and Commerce for the pledges over the equity interests under
	the equity pledge agreements, the amount of registered equity interests pledged to our wholly-owned subsidiaries was stated as RMB3,000,000, RMB18,500,000, RMB9,500,000, RMB14,000,000 and RMB5,000,000, respectively, which in aggregate represent 100%
	of the registered capital of New Oriental China. The equity pledge agreements with New Oriental China&#146;s shareholder provide that the pledged equity interest shall constitute continuing security for any and all of the indebtedness, obligations
	and liabilities under all of the principal service agreements and the scope of pledge shall not be limited by the amount of the registered capital of New Oriental China. However, it is possible that a PRC court may take the position that the amount
	listed on the equity pledge registration forms represents the full amount of the collateral that has been registered and perfected. If this is the case, the obligations that are supposed to be secured in the equity pledge agreements in excess of the
	amount listed on the equity pledge registration forms could be determined by the PRC court as unsecured debt, which takes last priority among creditors and often does not have to be paid back at all. We do not have agreements that pledge the assets
	of New Oriental China and its schools and subsidiaries for the benefit of us or our wholly-owned subsidiaries.

	New Oriental China is wholly owned by Century Friendship, a PRC domestic company which is beneficially owned by Mr.&nbsp;Michael Minhong Yu, our
	founder and executive chairman. The interests of Mr.&nbsp;Yu as the controlling shareholder of the entity which owns New Oriental China may differ from the interests of our company as a whole, since Mr.&nbsp;Yu is only one of the beneficial owners
	of our company, holding 14.1% of our total common shares issued and outstanding as of September&nbsp;23, 2016. We cannot assure you that when conflicts of interest arise, Mr.&nbsp;Yu will act in the best interests of our company or that conflicts of
	interests will be resolved in our favor. In addition, Mr.&nbsp;Yu may breach or cause New Oriental China and its schools and subsidiaries to breach or refuse to renew the existing contractual arrangements with us. Currently, we do not have existing
	arrangements to address potential conflicts of interest Mr.&nbsp;Yu may encounter in his capacity as a beneficial owner and director of New Oriental China, on the one hand, and as a beneficial owner and director of our company, on the other hand;
	provided that we could, at all times, exercise our option under the option agreement with Century Friendship to cause it to transfer all of its equity ownership in New Oriental China to a PRC entity or individual designated by us, and this new
	shareholder of New Oriental China could then appoint a new director of New Oriental China to replace Mr.&nbsp;Yu. In addition, if such conflicts of interest arise, Beijing Pioneer could also, in the capacity of Century Friendship&#146;s
	attorney-in-fact as provided under the proxy agreement and power of attorney, directly appoint a new director of New Oriental China to replace Mr.&nbsp;Yu. We rely on Century Friendship and Mr.&nbsp;Yu to comply with the laws of China, which protect
	contracts, including the contractual arrangements New Oriental China and its schools and subsidiaries and its shareholder have entered into with us, which provide that directors and executive officers owe a duty of loyalty to our company and require
	them to avoid conflicts of interest and not to take advantage of their positions for personal gains. We also rely on Mr.&nbsp;Yu to abide by the laws of the Cayman Islands, which provide that directors have a duty of care and a duty of loyalty to
	act honestly in good faith with a view to our best interests. However, the legal frameworks of China and the Cayman Islands do not provide guidance on resolving conflicts in the event of a conflict with another corporate governance regime. If we
	cannot resolve any conflicts of interest or disputes between us and Century Friendship and Mr.&nbsp;Yu, we would have to rely on legal proceedings, which could result in disruption of our business and subject us to substantial uncertainty as to the
	outcome of any such legal proceedings.

	We have three major types of chops&#151;corporate chops,

	executing leases and commercial, contracts. We use finance chops generally for making and collecting payments, including, but not limited to issuing invoices. Use of corporate chops and contract chops must be approved by our legal department and
	administrative department, and use of finance chops must be approved by our finance department. The chops of our subsidiaries and New Oriental China and its schools and subsidiaries are generally held by the relevant entities so that documents can
	be executed locally. Although we usually utilize chops to execute contracts, the registered legal representatives of our PRC subsidiaries, New Oriental China and its schools and subsidiaries have the apparent authority to enter into contracts on

	representatives of our PRC subsidiaries and New Oriental China and its schools and subsidiaries, the procedures may not be sufficient to prevent all instances of abuse or negligence. There is a risk that our employees or designated legal
	representatives could abuse their authority, for example, by binding the relevant subsidiary or New Oriental China and its schools and subsidiaries with contracts against our interests, as we would be obligated to honor these contracts if the other
	contracting party acts in good faith in reliance on the apparent authority of our chops or signatures of our legal representatives. If any designated legal representative obtains control of the chop in an effort to obtain control over the relevant
	entity, we would need to have a shareholder or board resolution to designate a new legal representative and to take legal action to seek the return of the chop, apply for a new chop with the relevant authorities, or otherwise seek legal remedies for
	the legal representative&#146;s misconduct. If any of the designated legal representatives obtains and misuses or misappropriates our chops and seals or other controlling intangible assets for whatever reason, we could experience disruption to our

	The principal regulations governing private education in China are The
	Law for Promoting Private Education (2003)&nbsp;and The Implementation Rules for the Law for Promoting Private Education (2004). Under these regulations, a private school may elect to be a school that does not require reasonable returns or a school
	that requires reasonable returns. As of May&nbsp;31, 2016, 23 of our schools elected as schools not requiring reasonable returns, 36 of our schools elected as schools requiring reasonable returns, and the remaining schools are not classified.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	At the end of each fiscal year, every private school is required to allocate a certain amount to its development fund for the construction or maintenance of
	the school or procurement or upgrade of educational equipment. In the case of a private school that requires reasonable returns, this amount shall be no less than 25% of annual net income of the school, while in the case of a private school that
	does not require reasonable returns, this amount shall be equivalent to no less than 25% of the annual increase in the net assets of the school, if any. A private school that requires reasonable returns must publicly disclose such election and
	additional information required under the regulations. A private school shall consider factors such as the school&#146;s tuition, ratio of the funds used for education-related activities to the course fees collected, admission standards and
	educational quality when determining the percentage of the school&#146;s net income that would be distributed to the investors as reasonable returns. However, none of the current PRC laws and regulations provides a formula or guidelines for
	determining &#147;reasonable returns.&#148; In addition, none of the current PRC laws and regulations sets forth different requirements or restrictions on a private school&#146;s ability to operate its education business based on such school&#146;s

	In some cities, our schools are registered as
	schools that require reasonable returns, while in other cities, our schools are registered as schools that do not require reasonable returns. The current PRC laws and regulations governing private education may be amended or replaced by new laws and
	regulations that (1)&nbsp;impose significant limitations on the ability of our schools to operate their business, charge course fees or make payments to related parties for services received, (2)&nbsp;specify the formula for calculating
	&#147;reasonable returns,&#148; (3)&nbsp;change the preferential tax treatment policies applicable to private schools, or (4)&nbsp;restrict a private school&#146;s ability to make payments to related parties for services. We cannot predict the
	timing and effects of any such amendments or new laws and regulations. Changes in PRC laws and regulations governing private education or otherwise affecting our schools&#146; operations could materially and adversely affect our business prospects
	and results of operations. For example, if the PRC government imposes additional limitations on private schools&#146; ability to operate their business or restricts private schools from making payments to related parties for services, our ability to
	receive service fees from our affiliated schools may be limited or we may have to reorganize our group structure.

	On July&nbsp;29, 2010, the PRC central
	government promulgated the Outline of China&#146;s National Plan for Medium- and Long-Term Education Reform and Development, which for the first time announced the policy that the government will implement a reform to divide private education
	entities into two categories: (1)&nbsp;for-profit private education entities and (2)&nbsp;not-for-profit private education entities. However, no further national law or regulation has been promulgated to implement the outline. If upon the
	implementation of this reform, our schools choose to be for-profit private education entities, they may be subject to income tax at the rate of 25% and other taxes as if they were enterprises. For the year ended May&nbsp;31, 2016, schools that
	accounted for approximately 60.3% of our consolidated net revenues were subject to a 25% income tax rate. Historically, the effective income tax rates for all our schools were 10.00%, 8.55% and 11.05% in the fiscal years ended May&nbsp;31, 2014,
	2015 and 2016, respectively. Additionally, if our schools choose to be not-for-profit private education entities, our contractual arrangements with New Oriental China and its schools and subsidiaries may be subject to more stringent scrutiny. As a
	result, implementation of this reform policy may adversely affect our results of operations.

	We may also decide to finance our PRC subsidiaries by means of capital contributions. These capital contributions must be

	Foreign Currency Capital of Foreign Invested Enterprises, or SAFE Circular 142, on August&nbsp;29, 2008 to regulate the conversion by a foreign-invested company of its capital contribution in foreign currency into RMB. SAFE Circular 142 requires
	that the paid-in capital of a foreign-invested company settled in RMB converted from foreign currencies shall be used only for purposes within the business scope as approved by the authorities in charge of foreign investment or by other competent
	authorities and as registered with the local branch of the SAIC and, unless set forth in the business scope or in other regulations, may not be used for equity investments within the PRC. In addition, SAFE strengthened its oversight of the flow and
	use of the paid-in capital of a foreign-invested company settled in RMB converted from foreign currencies. The use of such RMB paid-in capital may not be changed without SAFE&#146;s approval. Violations of Circular 142 will result in severe monetary
	or other penalties. In strengthening Circular 142, SAFE promulgated the Circular on Further Clarifying and Regulating Relevant Issues Concerning the Administration of Foreign Exchange under Capital Account, or SAFE Circular 45, on November&nbsp;9,
	2011, which expressly prohibits a foreign invested company from converting registered capital in foreign exchange into RMB for the purpose of equity investment, granting certain loans, repayment of inter-company loans, or repayment of bank loans

	authorization or attempts to distribute the retained earnings or assets of New Oriental China without our prior consent, we may need to resort to legal proceedings to enforce the terms of the contractual agreements. Any such litigation may be costly

	The global financial markets experienced significant disruptions in 2008 and the United
	States, Europe and other economies went into recession. The recovery from the lows of 2008 and 2009 was uneven and it is facing new challenges, including the escalation of the European sovereign debt crisis since 2011 and the slowdown of the Chinese
	economy since 2012. It is unclear whether the European sovereign debt crisis will be contained and when the Chinese economy will resume the high growth rate. There is considerable uncertainty over the long-term effects of the expansionary monetary
	and fiscal policies that have been adopted by the central banks and financial authorities of some of the world&#146;s leading economies, including China&#146;s. There have also been concerns over unrest in the Middle East and Africa, which have
	resulted in higher oil prices and significant market volatility, and over the possibility of a war involving Iran. There have also been concerns about the economic effect of the earthquake, tsunami and nuclear crisis in Japan and the relationship
	between China and Japan.

	The Ministry of Commerce published a discussion draft of the proposed Foreign Investment Law in January&nbsp;2015 aiming to, upon its enactment, replace the
	trio of existing laws regulating foreign investment in China, namely, the Sino-foreign Equity Joint Venture Enterprise Law, the Sino-foreign Cooperative Joint Venture Enterprise Law and the Wholly Foreign-invested Enterprise Law, together with their
	implementation rules&nbsp;and ancillary regulations. The draft Foreign Investment Law embodies an expected PRC regulatory trend to rationalize its foreign investment regulatory regime in line with prevailing international practice and the

	Among other things, the draft Foreign Investment Law expands the definition of foreign investment and
	introduces the principle of &#147;actual control&#148; in determining whether a company is considered a foreign-invested enterprise. The draft Foreign Investment Law specifically provides that entities established in China but &#147;controlled&#148;
	by foreign investors will be treated as foreign-invested enterprises, whereas an entity established in China by an investor from a foreign jurisdiction would nonetheless be, upon market entry clearance by the Ministry of Commerce, treated as a PRC
	domestic investor in a restricted industry as indicated in the &#147;negative list,&#148; provided that the entity is &#147;controlled&#148; by PRC entities and/or citizens. In this connection, &#147;control&#148; is broadly defined in the draft law
	to cover the following summarized categories: (i)&nbsp;holding 50% or more of the shares, voting rights or other similar rights of the subject entity; (ii)&nbsp;holding less than 50% of the shares, voting rights or other similar rights of the
	subject entity but having the power to secure at least 50% of the seats on the board or other equivalent decision making bodies, or having the voting power to exert material influence on the board, the shareholders&#146; meeting or other equivalent
	decision making bodies; or (iii)&nbsp;having the power to exert decisive influence, via contractual or trust arrangements, over the subject entity&#146;s operations, financial matters or other key aspects of business operations. Once an entity is
	determined to be a foreign-invested enterprise, it will be subject to the foreign investment restrictions or prohibitions set forth in a &#147;negative list,&#148; to be separately issued by the State Council at a later date. Unless the underlying
	business of the foreign-invested enterprise falls within the negative list, which calls for market entry clearance by the Ministry of Commerce, prior approval from the government authorities as mandated by the existing foreign investment legal
	regime would no longer be required for establishment of the foreign-invested enterprise.

	The &#147;variable interest entity&#148; structure, or VIE structure, has been adopted by many PRC-based
	companies, including us, to obtain necessary licenses and permits in the industries that are currently subject to foreign investment restrictions in China. See &#147;Item 3 Key Information &#151; D. Risk Factors &#151; Risks Related to Our Corporate

	variable interest entities that are controlled via contractual arrangement would also be deemed as foreign-invested enterprises, if they are ultimately &#147;controlled&#148; by foreign investors. Therefore, for any companies with a VIE structure in
	an industry category that is included in the &#147;negative list&#148; as restricted industry, the VIE structure may be deemed legitimate if the ultimate controlling person(s)&nbsp;is/are of PRC nationality (either PRC companies or PRC citizens) or

	has solicited comments from the public on this point. In addition, it is uncertain whether the online industries of lottery, insurance and other virtual products, in which our variable interest entities operate, will be subject to the foreign
	investment restrictions or prohibitions set forth in the &#147;negative list&#148; that is to be issued. If the enacted version of the Foreign Investment Law and the final &#147;negative list&#148; mandate further actions, such as market entry

	The draft Foreign Investment Law, if enacted as proposed, may
	also materially impact our corporate governance practice and increase our compliance costs. For instance, the draft Foreign Investment Law imposes stringent ad hoc and periodic information reporting requirements on foreign investors and the
	applicable foreign-invested enterprises. Aside from an investment implementation report and an investment amendment report that are required for each investment and alteration of investment specifics, an annual report is mandatory, and large
	foreign-invested enterprises meeting certain criteria are required to report on a quarterly basis. Also, the Ministry of Commerce may supervise and examine the foreign investors and the FIEs regularly or irregularly on their compliance with the
	Foreign Investment Law. Any company found to be non-compliant with these information reporting obligations may potentially be subject to fines and/or administrative or criminal liabilities, and the persons directly responsible may be subject to

	The PRC government imposes controls on the convertibility between the RMB and foreign currencies and, in certain cases, the remittance of currency out of

	The value of the Renminbi against the U.S. dollar and other currencies is affected by, among other things, changes in China&#146;s political and economic
	conditions and China&#146;s foreign exchange policies. The conversion of the Renminbi into foreign currencies, including the U.S. dollar, has been based on exchange rates set by the People&#146;s Bank of China. The PRC government allowed the
	Renminbi to appreciate by more than 20% against the U.S. dollar between July 2005 and July 2008. Between July 2008 and June 2010, this appreciation was halted and the exchange rate between the Renminbi and the U.S. dollar remained within a narrow
	band. Since June 2010, the Renminbi has fluctuated against the U.S. dollar, at times significantly and unpredictably. It is difficult to predict how market forces or PRC or U.S. government policy may impact the exchange rate between the Renminbi and

	According to The Implementation Rules for the Law for Promoting Private Education (2004), private schools that do
	not require reasonable returns enjoy the same preferential tax treatment as public schools, while the preferential tax treatment policies applicable to private schools requiring reasonable returns shall be separately formulated by the relevant
	authorities under the State Council. As of May&nbsp;31, 2016, 23 of our schools elected as schools not requiring reasonable returns, 36 of our schools elected as requiring reasonable returns and the remaining schools were not classified. The
	implementing rules of the EIT Law provide certain conditions under which not-for-profit entities may be exempted from enterprise income tax. According to such conditions, our schools may not be entitled to income tax exemption. To date, however, no
	separate specific regulations or policies have been promulgated by the relevant authorities in this regard and whether our schools can be entitled to any preferential income tax treatment remains unclear. In practice, tax treatments for private
	schools vary across different cities in China. For example, private schools in certain cities are subject to a 25% standard enterprise income tax starting from January&nbsp;1, 2008, while in other cities, private schools are subject to a fixed
	amount of enterprise income tax each year as determined by the local tax authority in lieu of the 25% standard enterprise income tax or are not required to pay enterprise income tax. On July&nbsp;8, 2013, Shanghai promulgated the Interim Measures
	for the Registration of Operational Private Training Institutions, or Measure No.&nbsp;5, which requires for-profit private training institutions to register with local administration of industry and commerce bureau. The Measure No.&nbsp;5 came into
	effect on August&nbsp;8, 2013 and expired after two years. However, based on telephone inquiries our PRC counsel made to the Shanghai Municipal education Commission, these provisional measures still apply in practice, since no alternative regulation
	is currently available. Our school in Shanghai has been subject to 25% standard enterprise income tax, and is thus not affected by Measure No.&nbsp;5. However, if similar regulations or policies are promulgated in other cities where we operate, and
	our schools choose to be or are required to be registered as for-profit private training institutions, they may be required to pay 25% standard enterprise income tax, which may be higher than the tax rates they are currently subject to, and our
	results of operations may be materially and adversely affected. Beijing Haidian School was not required by the governing tax bureau to pay any EIT since its establishment through May&nbsp;31, 2016. Preferential tax treatments granted to us by
	governmental authorities are subject to review and may be adjusted or revoked at any time in the future. The discontinuation of any preferential tax treatments currently available to us, especially to those schools in major cities, will cause our
	effective tax rate to increase, which will increase our income tax expenses and in turn decrease our net income.

	Under the EIT Law, enterprises established outside of China whose &#147;de facto management bodies&#148; are located in China are considered &#147;resident
	enterprises,&#148; and will generally be subject to the uniform 25% enterprise income tax rate for their global income. Although the term &#147;de facto management bodies&#148; is defined as &#147;management bodies which has substantial and overall
	management and control power on the operation, human resources, accounting and assets of the enterprise,&#148; the circumstances under which an enterprise&#146;s &#147;de facto management body&#148; would be considered to be located in China are
	currently unclear. A circular issued by the State Administration of Taxation on April&nbsp;22, 2009 provides that a foreign enterprise controlled by a PRC company or a PRC company group will be classified as a &#147;resident enterprise&#148; with
	its &#147;de facto management bodies&#148; located within China if the following requirements are satisfied: (1)&nbsp;the senior management and core management departments in charge of its daily operations function mainly in the PRC; (2)&nbsp;its
	financial and human resources decisions are subject to determination or approval by persons or bodies in the PRC; (3)&nbsp;its major assets, accounting books, company seals, and minutes and files of its board and shareholders&#146; meetings are
	located or kept in the PRC; and (4)&nbsp;at least half of the enterprise&#146;s directors or senior management with voting rights reside in the PRC. In addition, the State Administration of Taxation recently promulgated the Interim Provisions on
	Administration of Income Tax of Chinese-Controlled Resident Enterprise Registered Overseas, effective from September&nbsp;1, 2011, which clarified certain matters concerning the determination of resident status, administrative matters following this
	determination, and competent tax authorities. These interim provisions also specify that when an enterprise which is both Chinese-controlled and incorporated outside of mainland China receives PRC-sourced incomes such as dividends and interests, no
	PRC withholding tax is applicable if such enterprise has obtained a certificate evidencing its status as a PRC resident enterprise which is registered overseas and controlled by Chinese.

	Most members of our management team are based in China and are expected to remain in China. Although our offshore
	holding companies are not controlled by any PRC company or company group, we cannot assure you that we will not be deemed to be a PRC resident enterprise under the EIT Law and its implementation rules. If we are deemed to be a PRC resident
	enterprise, we will be subject to PRC enterprise income tax at the rate of 25% on our global income. In that case, however, dividend income we receive from our PRC subsidiaries may be exempt from PRC enterprise income tax because the EIT Law and its
	implementation rules generally provide that dividends received by a PRC resident enterprise from its directly invested entity that is also a PRC resident enterprise is exempt from enterprise income tax. Accordingly, if we are deemed to be a PRC
	resident enterprise and earn income other than dividends from our PRC subsidiaries, a 25% enterprise income tax on our global income could significantly increase our tax burden and materially and adversely affect our cash flow and profitability.

	In late 2012 this impasse led the SEC to commence administrative proceedings under Rule 102(e) of its Rules of

	accepted that future requests by the SEC for the production of documents will normally be made to the CSRC. The firms will receive matching Section&nbsp;106 requests, and are required to abide by a detailed set of procedures with respect to such
	requests, which in substance require them to facilitate production via the CSRC. If they fail to meet specified criteria, the SEC retains authority to impose a variety of additional remedial measures on the firms depending on the nature of the
	failure. Remedies for any future noncompliance could include, as appropriate, an automatic six-month bar on a single firm&#146;s performance of certain audit work, commencement of a new proceeding against a firm, or in extreme cases the resumption

	In addition, the stock market in general, and the market prices for companies with operations in China in

	law of the Cayman Islands. The common law of the Cayman Islands is derived in part from comparatively limited judicial precedents in the Cayman Islands as well as from English common law, which has persuasive, but not binding, authority on a court
	in the Cayman Islands. The rights of our shareholders and the fiduciary responsibilities of our directors under Cayman Islands law are not as clearly established as they would be under statutes or judicial precedents in the United States. In

	market value of our ADSs, the determination of whether we will be or become a PFIC will depend in large part upon the market value of our ADSs, of which we cannot control. Accordingly, fluctuations in the market price of our ADSs may cause us to
	become a PFIC for the current taxable year or future taxable years. The determination of whether we will be or become a PFIC will also depend, in part, upon the nature of our income and assets over time, which are subject to change from year to
	year. There can be no assurance that our business plans will not change in a manner that will affect the composition of our income and assets and our PFIC status. Because there are uncertainties in the application of the relevant rules and PFIC
	status is a fact-intensive determination made on an annual basis, no assurance can be given that we are not or will not become classified as a PFIC.

	Our first school was established by Michael Minhong Yu, our
	executive chairman, in Beijing, China in 1993 to offer TOEFL test preparation courses to college students. We established New Oriental China in 2001 as a domestic holding company to act as the sponsor of our schools and hold some operating
	subsidiaries. Since our inception, we have grown rapidly and transformed ourselves from primarily a language training and test preparation company to the largest provider of private educational services in China offering a wide range of educational
	programs, services and products to a varied student population throughout China.

	our &#147;New Oriental U-Can All Subjects&#148; training program, which targets middle and high school Chinese students from ages 13 to 18 who are preparing for the high school entrance examination in China, known as the zhongkao and the college

	size tutoring ranging from one to five students per class, in all subjects required for the college and high school entrance examinations, respectively. With this strategy of offering affordable larger classes and higher priced individualized small

	English is a major subject in elementary schools. We established our English for children program in 2002 for children in kindergarten through grade six and it has achieved rapid growth since that time. We designed our English for
	children program based upon the following principles: (1)&nbsp;we use localized materials originally published by international education content providers and publishers while taking into account the local public schools&#146; curricula and the
	skills and abilities of the individual child and adapting to his or her particular needs; (2)&nbsp;we assist students in mastering the basics of the language in various fun ways, including interactive games, activities and cultural studies; and
	(3)&nbsp;we help children develop a passion for learning the language and guide and inspire them to develop their self-learning abilities. In 2008, we launched our &#147;Pop Kids All Subjects&#148; training program, which offered after-school
	tutoring courses in English, math, Chinese, writing, music and arts for children in kindergarten and elementary schools.

	adults to test preparation to continuing professional education, and to encourage our students to introduce their children to the same system and courses. Outside of our organization, we have established cross-promotional relationships with a number

	The private education sector in China is rapidly evolving, highly fragmented and competitive, and we expect competition in this sector to persist and
	intensify. We face competition in each major program we offer and each geographic market in which we operate. For example, we face nationwide competition for our IELTS preparation courses from Global IELTS School, which offers IELTS preparation
	courses in many cities in China. We face regional competition for our English for children program from several competitors that focus on children&#146;s English language training in specific regions, including English First. We face limited
	competition from many competitors that focus on providing international and/or PRC test preparation courses in specific geographic markets in China. We also face competition from companies that focus on providing after-school tutoring services,
	including TAL Education Group and Xueda Education Group.

	more resources than we do. These competitors may be able to devote greater resources than we can to the development, promotion and sale of their programs, services and products and respond more quickly than we can to changes in student demands,
	testing materials, admissions standards, market needs or new technologies. In addition, we face competition from many different smaller sized organizations that focus on some of our targeted markets, which may be able to respond more promptly to

	The increasing use of the internet and advances in internet- and computer-related technologies, such as
	web video conferencing and online testing simulators, are eliminating geographic and cost-entry barriers to providing private educational services. As a result, many of our international competitors that offer online test preparation and language
	training courses may be able to more effectively penetrate the China market. Many of these international competitors have strong education brands, and students and parents in China may be attracted to the offerings of our international competitors
	based in the country that the student wishes to study in or in which the selected language is widely spoken. In addition, many smaller companies are able to use the internet to quickly and cost-effectively offer their programs, services and products

	Historically, our courses tend to have the largest student enrollments in our first fiscal quarter, which runs from June&nbsp;1 to August&nbsp;31 of each year, primarily because many students enroll in our courses during the summer vacation to
	enhance their foreign language skills and/or prepare for admissions and assessment tests in subsequent school terms. In addition, we have generally experienced larger student enrollments in our third fiscal quarter, which runs from December&nbsp;1

	Education Law of the PRC
</I>
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	On March&nbsp;18, 1995, the National People&#146;s Congress enacted the Education Law of the PRC, or the Education Law. The Education Law sets forth provisions
	relating to the fundamental education systems of the PRC, including a school system of pre-school education, primary education, secondary education and higher education, a system of nine-year compulsory education and a system of education
	certificates. The Education Law stipulates that the government should formulate plans for the development of education and establish and operate schools and other institutions of education, and that in principle, enterprises, social organizations
	and individuals are encouraged to operate schools and other types of educational organizations in accordance with PRC laws and regulations. However, no organization or individual may establish or operate a school or any other institution of
	education for profit-making purposes, though private schools may be operated for &#147;reasonable returns,&#148; as described in more detail below.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	On
	December&nbsp;27, 2015, the National People&#146;s Congress amended the Education Law of the PRC, which became effective on June&nbsp;1, 2016. The amended Education Law of the PRC, among other things, deleted the restrictions on organization or
	individual establishing or operating a school or any other institution of education for profit-making purposes, and added a requirement that the schools and other institution of education which are established with governmental fund or donated
	assets may not establish profit-making institutions of education.

	The Law for Promoting Private Education (2003)&nbsp;and the Implementation Rules for
	the Law for Promoting Private Education (2004)
</I>
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The Law for Promoting Private Education became effective on September&nbsp;1, 2003 and was amended on
	June&nbsp;29, 2013, and the Implementation Rules for the Law for Promoting Private Education became effective on April&nbsp;1, 2004. Under these regulations, &#147;private schools&#148; are defined as schools established by social organizations or
	individuals using non-government funds. In addition, private schools providing certifications, pre-school education, education for self-study aid and other academic education shall be subject to approval by the education authorities, while private
	schools engaging in occupational qualification training and occupational skill training shall be subject to approvals from the authorities in charge of labor and social welfare. A duly approved private school will be granted a Permit for Operating a
	Private School, and shall be registered with the Ministry of Civil Affairs or its local counterparts as a privately run non-enterprise institution. Each of our schools has obtained the Permit for Operating a Private School and has been registered
	with the relevant local counterpart of the Ministry of Civil Affairs.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Under the above regulations, private schools have the same status as public
	schools, though private schools are prohibited from providing military, police, political and other kinds of education which are of a special nature. Government-run schools that provide compulsory education are not permitted to be converted into
	private schools. In addition, the operation of a private school is highly regulated. For example, the types and amounts of fees charged by a private school providing certifications shall be approved by the governmental pricing authority and be
	publicly disclosed. A private school that does not provide certifications shall file its pricing information with the governmental pricing authority and publicly disclose such information. Except for our primary and secondary school in Yangzhou and
	a private secondary school in Beijing, which provide graduation certifications to students, none of the schools operated by New Oriental China provides a diploma or certification to students.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Private education is treated as a public welfare undertaking under the regulations. Nonetheless, investors of a private school may choose to require
	&#147;reasonable returns&#148; from the annual net balance of the school after deduction of costs, donations received, government subsidies, if any, the reserved development fund and other expenses as required by the regulations. Private schools are
	divided into three categories: private schools established with donated funds; private schools that require reasonable returns and private schools that do not require reasonable returns.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The election to establish a private school requiring reasonable returns shall be provided in the articles of association of the school. The percentage of the
	school&#146;s annual net balance that can be distributed as reasonable return shall be determined by the school&#146;s board of directors, taking into consideration the following factors: (1)&nbsp;items and criteria for the school&#146;s fees,
	(2)&nbsp;the ratio of the school&#146;s expenses used for educational activities and improving the educational conditions to the total fees collected, and (3)&nbsp;the admission standards and educational quality. The relevant information relating to
	the above factors shall be publicly disclosed before the school&#146;s board determines the percentage of the school&#146;s annual net balance that can be distributed as reasonable returns. Such information and the decision to distribute reasonable
	returns shall also be filed with the approval authorities within 15 days from the decision made by the board. However, none of the current PRC laws and regulations provides a formula or guidelines for determining &#147;reasonable returns.&#148; In
	addition, none of the current PRC laws and regulations sets forth different requirements or restrictions on a private school&#146;s ability to operate its education business based on such school&#146;s status as a school that requires reasonable
	returns or a school that does not require reasonable returns.

	At the end of each fiscal year, every private school is required to allocate a certain amount to its development
	fund for the construction or maintenance of the school or procurement or upgrade of educational equipment. In the case of a private school that requires reasonable returns, this amount shall be no less than 25% of the annual net income of the
	school, while in the case of a private school that does not require reasonable returns, this amount shall be equal to no less than 25% of the annual increase in the net assets of the school, if any. Private schools that do not require reasonable
	returns shall be entitled to the same preferential tax treatment as public schools, while the preferential tax treatment policies applicable to private schools requiring reasonable returns shall be formulated by the finance authority, taxation

	Sponsorship of Private Schools
</I>
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Under the Law for Promoting Private Education and the Implementation Rules for Promoting Private Education, entities and individuals that establish private
	schools are referred to as &#147;sponsors.&#148; As of May&nbsp;31, 2016, New Oriental China was the sponsor of 66 schools, Beijing New Oriental Stars was the sponsor of two kindergartens and Beijing Sincerity Technology Co., Ltd, or Beijing
	Sincerity, was the sponsor of three kindergartens.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The &#147;sponsorship interest&#148; that a sponsor holds in a private school is, for all practical
	purposes, substantially equivalent under PRC law and practice to the &#147;equity interest&#148; a shareholder holds in a company. Pursuant to the Implementation Rules for Promoting Private Education, a sponsor of a private school has the obligation
	to make capital contributions to the school in a timely manner. The contributed capital can be in the form of tangible or non-tangible assets such as materials in kind, land use rights or intellectual property rights. Pursuant to the Law for
	Promoting Private Education, the capital contributed by the sponsor becomes assets of the school and the school has independent legal person status. In addition, pursuant to the Law for Promoting Private Education and the Implementation Rules for
	Promoting Private Education, the sponsor of a private school has the right to exercise ultimate control over the school. Specifically, the sponsor has control over the private school&#146;s constitutional documents and has the right to elect and
	replace the private school&#146;s decision making bodies, such as the school&#146;s board of directors, and therefore controls the private school&#146;s business and affairs.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Before the Law for Promoting Private Education took effect in 2003, the Regulations on Schools Run by Different Sectors of Society had provided that upon
	liquidation, the residual assets of a private school after the original investment had been returned to the sponsor would be used by the relevant PRC government for the development of private education. However, this is no longer the case, as
	Article 68 of the Law for Promoting Private Education expressly abolished the Regulations on Schools Run by Different Sectors of Society. As advised by Tian Yuan Law Firm, our PRC counsel, since the Law for Promoting Private Education became
	effective on September&nbsp;1, 2003, there has been no case in China where a private school became state property or was otherwise appropriated by a government authority upon liquidation.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Furthermore, we are not aware that PRC law provides that upon liquidation of a private school, the sponsor is legally restricted to receive only its invested
	capital and is not allowed to have other return. According to our PRC counsel, there is no national law that addresses this subject one way or the other. In the absence of a national law providing for the sponsor&#146;s rights upon liquidation of a
	private school, provincial regulations and interpretations are ambiguous and inconsistent on this subject. There are local regulations or interpretations that specifically provide that sponsors are entitled to private schools&#146; residual assets
	pro rata based on their respective capital contribution. Nevertheless, there are also local regulations that are less clear in this regard.

	Notwithstanding the legal uncertainties surrounding this issue, we believe that the potential risk that we will
	not receive all of the residual assets upon the liquidation of a school is immaterial. There were no capital contributions made by any PRC governmental authorities to our schools. Nor did any of our schools ever receive donations from any third
	parties, including PRC governmental authorities or any third party enterprises. Since the Law for Promoting Private Education became effective on September&nbsp;1, 2003, we and our PRC counsel are not aware of any case in China where a private
	school became state property or was otherwise appropriated by a government authority upon liquidation without the prior consent of its sponsor. We historically have never liquidated any school that was profitable and we have no plan to do so in the
	future. If, for any reason, we would like to divest a profitable school, a commercially sensible way to do so is to sell the school, rather than to liquidate the school. In this situation, the sponsor is entitled to receive consideration for
	transferring sponsorship, which often exceeds its initial investment in the school.

</I>
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	On July&nbsp;29, 2010, the PRC central government promulgated the Outline of China&#146;s
	National Plan for Medium- and Long-Term Education Reform and Development (2010-2020), which for the first time announced the policy that the government will implement a reform to divide private education entities into two categories:
	(1)&nbsp;for-profit private education entities and (2)&nbsp;not-for-profit private education entities. On October&nbsp;24, 2010, the General Office of the State Council issued the Notices on the National Education System Innovation Pilot. Under this
	notice, the PRC government plans to implement a for-profit and non- profit classified management of the private schools in Shanghai, Zhejiang, Shenzhen and Jilin Huaqiao Foreign Language School. However, the above outline and the innovation pilot is
	still new and no further national law or regulation has been promulgated to implement them and, except in Shanghai, no other local government of the pilot areas has promulgated relevant regulations on differentiated management of the private schools
	and for-profit training institutions. On July&nbsp;8, 2013, Shanghai promulgated the Interim Measures for the Registration of Operational Private Training Institutions, or Measure No.&nbsp;5, which requires for-profit private training institutions
	to register with local administration of industry and commerce bureau. Measure No.&nbsp;5 came into effect on August&nbsp;8, 2013 and expired after two years. However, based on telephone inquiries our PRC counsel made to the Shanghai Municipal
	education Commission, these provisional measures still apply in practice, since no alternative regulation is currently available. If our schools choose to be not-for-profit private education entities, our contractual arrangements with New Oriental
	China and its schools and subsidiaries may be subject to more stringent scrutiny and the education authorities may not allow our schools to pay us services fees under the contractual arrangements as they currently do. As a result, the implementation
	of this reform may adversely affect our results of operations.

</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	According to applicable PRC regulations on foreign-invested enterprises, capital contributions from a foreign holding company to its PRC subsidiaries, which
	are considered foreign-invested enterprises, may only be made when approval by the Ministry of Commerce or its local branch has been obtained. In approving such capital contributions, the Ministry of Commerce or its local branch examines the
	business scope of each foreign invested enterprise under review to ensure it complies with the Foreign-Investment Industrial Guidance Catalog, which classifies industries in China into three categories, namely &#147;encouraged foreign investment
	industries,&#148; &#147;restricted foreign investment industries&#148; and &#147;prohibited foreign investment industries.&#148; Industries not listed in the Foreign-Investment Industrial Guidance Catalog are generally open to foreign investment
	unless specifically restricted by other PRC regulations. On March&nbsp;10, 2015, a new Foreign-Investment Industrial Guidance Catalog was issued to become effective on April&nbsp;10, 2015 and to replace the previous one issued in 2011.

	education, senior high schools and higher education in cooperative ways by the form of a cooperative joint venture in the PRC. Beijing New Oriental Stars Education&nbsp;&amp; Consulting Co., Ltd., or Beijing New Oriental Stars, a subsidiary of New
	Oriental China, is the holding company of our two kindergartens and its expansion will be affected by this updated catalog. Foreign investment is banned from compulsory education, which means grades 1 to 9. Foreign investment is allowed in

	The Draft PRC Foreign Investment Law
</I>
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	In January 2015, the Ministry of Commerce published a discussion draft of the proposed Foreign Investment Law aiming to, upon its enactment, replace the trio
	of existing laws regulating foreign investment in China, namely, the Sino-foreign Equity Joint Venture Enterprise Law, the Sino-foreign Cooperative Joint Venture Enterprise Law and the Wholly Foreign-invested Enterprise Law, together with their
	implementation rules and ancillary regulations.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Among other things, the draft Foreign Investment Law expands the definition of foreign investment and
	introduces the standard of &#147;actual control&#148; in determining whether a company is considered a foreign-invested enterprise, or an FIE. The draft Foreign Investment Law specifically provides that entities established in China but
	&#147;controlled&#148; by foreign investors must be deemed as FIEs, whereas an entity set up in a foreign jurisdiction would nonetheless be, upon market entry clearance by the Ministry of Commerce, treated as a PRC domestic investor provided that
	the entity is &#147;controlled&#148; by PRC entities and/or citizens. In this connection, &#147;control&#148; is broadly defined in the draft law to cover the following summarized categories: (i)holding 50% or more of the voting rights or similar
	equity interest of the subject entity; (ii)holding less than 50% of the voting rights or similar equity interest of the subject entity but having the power to secure at least 50% of the seats on the board or other equivalent decision making bodies,
	or having the voting power to exert material influence on the board, the shareholders&#146; meeting or other equivalent decision making bodies; or (iii)having the power to exert decisive influence, via contractual or trust arrangements, over the
	subject entity&#146;s operations, financial matters or other key aspects of business operations. Once an entity is determined to be an FIE, and its investment amount exceeds certain thresholds or its business operation falls within a &#147;negative
	list,&#148; to be separately issued by the State Council in the future and to replace the Foreign-Investment Industrial Guidance Catalog, market entry clearance by the Ministry of Commerce or its local counterparts will be required. Otherwise, all
	foreign investors may make investments on the same terms as domestic investors without being subject to additional approval from the government authorities as mandated by the existing foreign investment legal regime.

	Under the draft Foreign Investment Law, variable interest entities that are controlled via contractual
	arrangement would also be deemed as FIEs, if they are ultimately &#147;controlled&#148; by foreign investors. Therefore, for any companies with a VIE structure in an industry category that is on the &#147;negative list,&#148; the VIE structure may
	be deemed legitimate only if the ultimate controlling person(s) is/are of PRC nationality (either PRC state-owned enterprises or agencies or PRC citizens). Conversely, if the actual controlling person(s) is/are of foreign nationalities, then the
	variable interest entities will be treated as FIEs and any operation in the industry category on the &#147;negative list&#148; without market entry clearance may be considered as illegal. However, the draft Foreign Investment Law has not taken a
	position on what actions shall be taken with respect to the existing companies with a VIE structure, whether or not these companies are controlled by PRC parties, while it has solicited comments from the public on this point.

	The draft Foreign Investment Law also imposes stringent ad hoc and periodic information reporting requirements on foreign investors and the applicable FIEs.
	Aside from investment implementation report and investment amendment report that are required at each investment and alteration of investment specifics, an annual report is mandatory, and large foreign investors meeting certain criteria are required
	to report on a quarterly basis. Some of the information requested may be sensitive to foreign investors, such as the identity of the actual controller and the source of investment. Any company found to be non-compliant with these information
	reporting obligations may potentially be subject to fines and/or administrative or criminal liabilities, and the persons directly responsible may be subject to criminal liabilities.

	foreign investment or by other competent authorities and as registered with the Administration for Industries and Commerce and, unless set forth in the business scope or in PRC regulations, may not be used for equity investments within the PRC. In

	On March&nbsp;16, 2007,
	the National People&#146;s Congress, the Chinese legislature, passed the EIT Law, which took effect on January&nbsp;1, 2008. The EIT Law applies a uniform 25% enterprise income tax rate to both foreign-invested enterprises and domestic enterprises.
	There is a transition period for the enterprises, whether foreign-invested or domestic, which had received preferential tax treatments granted by relevant tax authorities prior to March&nbsp;16, 2007. Enterprises that had been subject to an
	enterprise income tax rate lower than 25% prior to March&nbsp;16, 2007 may continue to enjoy the lower rate and gradually transfer to the new tax rate within five years after the effective date of the EIT Law. Enterprises that had been entitled to
	exemptions or reductions from the standard income tax rate for a fixed term prior to March&nbsp;16, 2007 may continue to enjoy such treatment until the fixed term expires. Preferential tax treatments will continue to be granted to industries and
	projects that are strongly supported and encouraged by the state, and enterprises otherwise classified as &#147;high and new technology enterprises strongly supported by the state&#148; upon re-examination will be entitled to a 15% enterprise income
	tax rate. The EIT Law empowers the State Council to enact appropriate implementing rules and regulations. The State Council promulgated the implementation rules of the EIT Law in December 2007 and the Ministry of Science and Technology, the Ministry
	of Finance and the State Administration of Taxation promulgated other supplemental rules in April 2008 and July 2008 which were amended in January 2016 and June 2016, respectively, regarding new criteria for the granting of &#147;high and new
	technology enterprises&#148; status. Any enterprises to be granted with &#147;high and new technology enterprises&#148; status shall meet certain requirements, including but not limited to the following: (1)&nbsp;the enterprise has incorporated for
	more than one year before application; (2)&nbsp;the enterprise itself owns the intellectual property right for the core technology of its product or service; (3)&nbsp;the enterprise&#146;s core technology of its product or service falls into the
	ambit of &#147;high-tech fields heavily supported by the government&#148;; (4)&nbsp;technicians has engaged into research and development account for more than 10% of all the staff; (5)&nbsp;in the latest three financial years (actual operating year
	if incorporated less than three years), the research and development expenses account for 3%-6% or more of the latest sales revenue and the research and development expenses incurred within China shall not be less than 60% of the total research and
	development expenses; (6)&nbsp;the revenue in the latest year derived from the high-tech product or service accounts for more 60% of the total revenue; (7)&nbsp;the innovation capability of the enterprise shall meet the relevant evaluation
	standards; and (8)&nbsp;no major security or qualification incident or sever environmental illegal behavior occurred within the previous year before application. To apply for the &#147;high and new technology enterprises&#148; status, an enterprise
	shall file its corporate certificates and supporting documents evidencing the requirements to the relevant government authority. The government authority will examine the filed certificates and documents to determine whether the enterprise meets the
	&#147;high and new technology enterprises&#148; requirements. If the decision is positive, the authority will make a public announcement and grant the enterprise with a &#147;high and new technology enterprises&#148; certificate with a valid term of
	three years. Upon the expiration of the initial term, the enterprise shall file a new application to obtain such status. Loss of any preferential tax treatments previously granted to us could have a material and adverse effect on our financial
	condition and results of operations.

	also specifies that when provided with a copy of a PRC tax resident determination certificate from a resident PRC-controlled offshore incorporated enterprise, the payer should not withhold 10% income tax when paying the PRC-sourced dividends,
	interest and royalties to the PRC-controlled offshore incorporated enterprise. Although both the circular and the bulletin only apply to offshore enterprises controlled by PRC enterprises and not those by PRC individuals, the determination criteria

	PRC laws and regulations currently require any foreign entity that invests in the education business in China to be an educational institution

	schools for students in grades ten to twelve is restricted and foreign ownership of primary and middle schools for students in grades one to nine is prohibited. As a result, our offshore holding companies are not allowed to directly own and operate
	schools in China. We conduct substantially all of our education business in China through contractual arrangements between our wholly-owned subsidiaries in China, and our variable interest entity(ies), their schools and subsidiaries and their

	. Exclusive option agreements were entered into by us and New Oriental China and the shareholders of New Oriental

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	We have benefited significantly from favorable demographic trends, the overall economic growth and the demand for high-quality private education and English
	language training in China. The overall economic growth and the increase in the GDP per capita in China have led to a significant increase in spending on education in China. At the same time, China&#146;s integration into the global economy has
	continued, resulting in more career opportunities for Chinese citizens who are able to communicate effectively in English. We anticipate that the demand for private education and English language training in China will continue to increase as
	China&#146;s economy continues to grow and as disposable income of urban households continues to rise. However, any adverse changes in the economic conditions or regulatory environment in China may have a material adverse effect on the private
	education industry in China, which in turn may harm our business and results of operations.

	Specific Factors Affecting Our Results of Operations
</I>
</B>
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	While our business is influenced by factors affecting the private education industry in China generally and by conditions in each of the
	geographic markets we serve, we believe our business is more directly affected by company-specific factors such as the number of student enrollments, the amount of course fees and our operating costs and expenses. The number of student enrollments
	is in turn largely driven by the demand for our courses, the effectiveness of our marketing and brand promotion efforts, our ability to optimize our comprehensive online and offline integrated education ecosystem in a constant basis, the locations
	of our schools and learning centers, our ability to maintain the consistency and quality of our teaching, and our ability to respond to competitive pressure, as well as seasonal factors. We determine course fees primarily based on demand for our
	courses, the targeted market for our courses, the subject of the course, the geographic location of the school, cost of services, and the course fees charged by our competitors for the same or similar courses.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Our future results of operations will depend significantly upon our ability to increase paying users for our online courses, increase student enrollments at
	existing schools and learning centers and further expand our school network throughout China, as well as offer a greater variety of courses, including smaller-size classes. Our planned expansion may result in substantial demands on our management,
	operational, technological, financial and other resources. To manage and support our growth, we must improve our existing operational, administrative and technological systems and our financial and management controls, and recruit, train and retain
	additional qualified teachers and school management personnel as well as other administrative and sales and marketing personnel, particularly as we grow outside of our existing markets. We will continue to implement additional systems and measures
	and recruit qualified personnel in order to effectively manage and support our growth. If we cannot achieve these improvements, our financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected.

	. Our educational programs and services consist of language training and test preparation courses, primary and
	secondary school education and online education. Revenues from language training courses and test preparation courses accounted for 85.2%, 83.4% and 83.8%, respectively, of our total net revenues in the fiscal years ended May&nbsp;31, 2014, 2015 and

	We recognize revenues from course fees collected for enrollment in our language training and test preparation courses proportionally as we
	deliver the instruction over the period of the course. Course fees are generally paid in advance by students and are initially recorded as deferred revenues. Students are entitled to a short-term trial period which commences on the date the course
	begins. Tuition refunds are provided to students if they decide within the trial period that they no longer want to take the course. After the trial period, if a student withdraws from a class, usually no refunds will be provided and any collected
	but unearned portion of the fee is recognized at that time. We recognize revenues from school fees collected for enrollment in our primary and secondary schools ratably over the corresponding academic year. We sell pre-paid online education cards
	primarily to distributors, who in turn sell them to students. We recognize revenues from sales of pre-paid cards in proportion to the actual time that students spend on our online courses. Course fees and school fees collected and amounts received
	from sales of pre-paid cards are recorded as deferred revenues until they can be recognized as revenues upon their use or expiration. Upon expiration of a prepaid card, which is six months to one year from the date of the sale of the card, we
	recognize the remaining amount of deferred revenues as revenues.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The most significant factors that directly affect our revenues from educational programs
	and services are the number of student enrollments and the amount of course fees. We believe our students are attracted to us primarily because of our established brand and reputation in the private education sector, especially in the areas of
	English language training, overseas admissions and assessment test preparation and K-12 after-school tutoring program, the quality of our instruction and the variety of our programs, services and products. For the past several years, our revenue
	growth has been driven primarily by increased enrollments in our K-12 after-school tutoring courses and overseas test preparation courses and other programs and services. The number of student enrollments for our courses is affected by the demand
	for our courses, the effectiveness of our marketing and brand promotion, the demographic composition of the cities where we have schools and learning centers, our ability to respond to competitive pressure, as well as seasonal factors. To further
	penetrate the K-12 after-school tutoring market, we have expanded the scope of our course offerings to cover non-English subjects, including through our New Oriental U-Can (Non-English) all subjects training program for middle and high school
	students and Pop Kids (Non-English) all subjects training program for elementary school students, and plan to further expand our course offerings and geographic coverage in the future to capture a larger share of the huge after-school training
	market in China. In order to use new technology to reshape our traditional offline classroom-teaching offerings and enhance customers&#146; learning experience, we developed our own O2O two-way interactive learning platform, or the O2O platform, by
	standardizing and digitalizing our education content and user data. We established a database of learning modules for internet-based self-learning practice and assessment. The O2O platform complements and supports students&#146; offline learning
	activities by offering online learning components, such as pushing customized content to students, recommending additional courses based on their online study records and performance, facilitating interaction between students, teachers and parents
	across a variety of devices, including smartphones, tablets and PCs.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Our courses generally have the largest student enrollments in our first fiscal
	quarter, which runs from June&nbsp;1 to August&nbsp;31 of each year, primarily because many students enroll in our courses during the summer vacation to enhance their foreign language skills and/or prepare for admissions and assessment tests in
	subsequent school terms. We expect this seasonality in enrollment pattern to continue, especially for most of our language training courses for college and middle school students and test preparation courses.

	We determine course fees primarily based on demand for our courses, the targeted market for our courses, the
	subject of the course, the geographic location of the school, cost of services, and the course fees charged by our competitors for the same or similar programs. Our test preparation courses are generally delivered in class settings ranging from 1
	student to 150 students per class. Our K-12 after-school tutoring courses and our English language training courses are delivered in class settings generally ranging from 1 student to 100 students per class. In November 2013, we launched an online
	test preparation program on our own online education website koolearn.com, which features live broadcasts of a series of our most popular offline test preparation classes. We typically adjust course fees or school fees based on the market conditions
	of the city where the particular school is located, subject to the relevant local governmental authority&#146;s advance approval, if required. We expect to continue to derive a substantial majority of our revenues from educational programs and
	services.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	A significant portion of our revenues has been derived from test preparation courses. The success of our test preparation courses depends on
	the continued use of admissions and assessment tests by educational institutions and governmental authorities both in China and abroad. If the use of admissions and assessment tests declines or falls out of favor with educational institutions,
	government authorities and other entities, the markets for our test preparation courses will shrink and our business may be materially and adversely affected.

	Books and Others

	. We distribute and sell books and other educational materials developed or licensed by us through our own distribution channels, which
	consist of our bookstores and websites, and also through third-party distributors. We normally provide books and other educational materials that are required for our courses and do not separately charge students for these items. We recognize
	revenues from sales of books and other educational materials when the products are sold to end customers. As we believe successful content development is important to the success of our business, we intend to continuously enhance the quality and
	breadth of our education content offerings and distribute more books and other educational materials through our own bookstores, as well as third-party distributors.

	We rely on our teachers to deliver educational services. Our teachers consist of both full-time teachers and contract
	teachers. Full-time teachers deliver instruction and may also be involved in management, administration and other functions at our schools. Full-time teachers&#146; compensation and benefits primarily consist of teaching fees based on hourly rates,
	performance-linked bonuses based on student evaluations, as well as base salary, annual bonus and standard employee benefits in connection with their services other than teaching. Compensation of our contract teachers is comprised primarily of
	teaching fees based on hourly rates and performance-linked bonuses based on student evaluations and other factors. To attract and retain high-quality teachers, we have granted equity incentives, including restricted shares and share options, to some
	of our teachers. We account for teaching fees and performance-linked bonuses paid to our teachers as cost of revenues as they are directly associated with the provision of educational services, and account for the other compensation and benefits to
	our teachers as general and administrative expenses.

	operating entities in China are subject to a value-added tax (&#147;VAT&#148;) at varying rates ranging from 3% to 17% on their respective net revenues. Our operating entities in China used to be subject to a 3% to 5% business tax on gross revenues
	generated from providing services and related surcharges. According to the then-in-effect Circular No.&nbsp;111 and Circular No.&nbsp;71 issued by the Ministry of Finance and the State Administration of Taxation on November&nbsp;11, 2011 and
	July&nbsp;31, 2012, respectively, the new enrollment system development services and other operating services provided by Beijing Hewstone, Beijing Decision, Shanghai Smart Words, Beijing Smart Wood and Beijing Pioneer which were previously subject
	to business tax before the implementation of Circular No.&nbsp;111 and Circular No.&nbsp;71, have since become subject to value-added tax following the implantation of these two circulars. Pursuant to the same, the operating services provided by
	Beijing Joy Tend and Beijing Right Time, Beijing Top, Beijing Shenghe and Beijing Magnificence are also subject to value-added tax. On May&nbsp;24, 2013, the Ministry of Finance and the State Administration of Taxation promulgated Circular
	No.&nbsp;37, which replaces Circular No.&nbsp;111 and Circular No.&nbsp;71 and expands such practice of replacing business tax with value-added tax to nationwide starting August&nbsp;1, 2013. Following the change from business tax to value-added
	tax, the applicable tax rate for such services increased by 1%, from 5% up to 6%, while the tax payable amount of value-added tax relating to such services was the output tax amount in a tax period minus input tax amount in the same period. Pursuant
	to Circular No.&nbsp;68 which was promulgated on June&nbsp;18, 2016, our operating entities that provide non-academic education services are subject to a simple VAT collection method and apply for a 3% VAT rate since May 2016. VAT is reported as a
	deduction to revenue when incurred. Circular No.&nbsp;37 and the subsequent relevant implementation measures and rules are relatively new, and the interpretation and enforcement of this circular and its implementation measures and rules involve
	uncertainties. To date, the practices instituted under the new circular have had no material adverse effect on the tax positions of our operating entities in China.

	With regard to income tax, according to the Implementation Rules for the Law for Promoting Private Education (2004), private schools that do not require
	reasonable returns enjoy the same preferential tax treatment as public schools, while the preferential tax treatment policies applicable to private schools requiring reasonable returns shall be separately formulated by the relevant authorities under
	the State Council. To date, however, no regulations have been promulgated by the relevant authorities in this regard. As of May&nbsp;31, 2016, 23 of our schools elected as schools not requiring reasonable returns, 36 of our schools elected as
	requiring reasonable returns and the remaining schools were not classified. The implementing rules of the EIT Law provide certain conditions under which not-for-profit entities may be exempted from enterprise income tax. According to such
	conditions, our schools may not be entitled to income tax exemption. To date, however, no separate specific regulations or policies have been promulgated by the relevant authorities in this regard and whether our schools can be entitled to any
	preferential income tax treatment remains unclear. In practice, tax treatments for private schools vary across different cities in China. For example, private schools in certain cities are subject to a 25% standard enterprise income tax starting
	from January&nbsp;1, 2008, while in other cities, private schools are subject to a fixed amount of enterprise income tax each year as determined by the local tax authority in lieu of the 25% standard enterprise income tax or are not required to pay
	enterprise income tax. Among our schools in the four major cities from which we derived a significant portion of our revenues in the fiscal year ended May&nbsp;31, 2016, three schools are subject to the standard 25% enterprise income tax rate and
	one school is not required by the governing tax bureau to pay any EIT since its establishment through May&nbsp;31, 2016.

	Enterprises that qualify as &#147;high and new technology enterprises&#148; are entitled to a 15% enterprise
	income tax rate rather than the 25% uniform statutory tax rate. In December 2008, Beijing Hewstone and Beijing Decision and Xuncheng Network were recertified as &#147;high and new technology enterprises&#148; in Beijing, and Beijing Pioneer was
	added to this list in November 2015 and enjoyed a reduced tax rate of 15% starting January 2015. All of them are entitled to a 15% tax rate as long as they continue to qualify as high and new technology enterprises. The deferred tax balance of
	Beijing Hewstone, Beijing Decision, Beijing Pioneer and Xuncheng Network is calculated at a rate of 15%, as we expect them to continue to be qualified as &#147;high and new technology enterprises.&#148;

	Preferential tax treatments granted
	to our schools by local governmental authorities are subject to review and may be adjusted or revoked at any time. In addition, if the government regulations or authorities were to phase out preferential tax benefits currently granted to &#147;high
	and new technology enterprises,&#148; New Oriental China and our wholly-owned subsidiaries in China would be subject to the 25% uniform statutory tax rate. The discontinuation of any preferential tax treatments currently available to our schools,
	especially those schools in major cities, and to New Oriental China and our wholly-owned subsidiaries, will cause our effective tax rate to increase, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.

	During the years ended May&nbsp;31, 2014 and 2015, we identified six operating segments, including language training and test preparation, primary and

	education, content development and distribution, pre-school education, overseas study consulting services and study tour. Language training and test preparation and primary and secondary school education have been identified as reportable segments.
	Online education, content development and distribution, pre-school education, overseas study consulting services and study tour operating segments were aggregated as others because individually they do not exceed the 10% quantitative threshold.

	We recognize revenues from course fees collected for enrollment in our language training and test preparation courses proportionally as we deliver the instruction over the period of the course. We recognize revenues from school fees collected for

	Educational programs and services

	Educational programs and services consist of language training and test preparation courses, primary and secondary school education and college admission
	examination retaking training services. Tuition is generally paid in advance and is initially recorded as deferred revenue. Tuition revenue for educational programs and services is recognized proportionately as the instructions are delivered, and is
	reported net of business taxes, VAT and related surcharges, and tuition refunds. Students are entitled to a short term course trial period which commences on the date the course begins. Tuition refunds are provided to students if they decide within
	the trial period that they no longer want to take the course. Tuition refunds have been insignificant in the fiscal years ended May&nbsp;31, 2014, 2015 and 2016, respectively. After the trial period, if a student withdraws from a class, usually no
	refunds will be provided and any collected but unearned portion of the fee is recognized at that time.

	We also sell online-learning cards primarily to
	distributors at fixed prices after deducting a pre-determined fixed discount to the face value of the cards. Online-learning card sales represent prepaid service fees received from students for e-learning services. The prepaid service fee is
	recorded as deferred revenue upon receiving the upfront payment. Revenue is recognized upon actual usage of the cards by the students based on the number of minutes the students use the e-learning services, of which the actual usage is tracked by us
	on an individual basis. Upon the expiration of the online-learning card, which ranges from six months to one year from the date of sale of the card to the distributor, we will recognize the remaining unused minutes as revenue.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	PRC laws and regulations currently require any foreign entity that invests in the education business in China to be an educational institution with relevant
	experience in providing educational services outside China. Our offshore holding companies are not educational institutions and do not provide educational services outside China. To comply with the PRC laws and regulations, we conduct substantially
	all of our business through New Oriental China and Xuncheng, our variable interest entities, and their schools and subsidiaries. We have, through our wholly-owned subsidiaries in the PRC, entered into contractual arrangements with New Oriental
	China, its schools and subsidiaries, Xuncheng and its subsidiary, and their shareholders such that New Oriental China and its schools and subsidiaries, Xuncheng and its subsidiary (collectively the &#147;VIEs) are considered variable interest
	entities for which we are considered their primary beneficiary. We believe we have substantive kick-out rights per the terms of the option agreement, which gives us the power to control the shareholder of New Oriental China and Xuncheng. More
	specifically, we believe that the terms of the exclusive option agreement are currently exercisable and legally enforceable under PRC laws and regulations. We also believe that the minimum amount of consideration permitted by the applicable PRC law
	to exercise the option does not represent a financial barrier or disincentive for us to exercise our rights under the exclusive option agreement. A simple majority vote of our board of directors is required to pass a resolution to exercise our
	rights under the exclusive option agreement, for which consent of the shareholder of New Oriental China and Xuncheng is not required. Therefore, we believe this gives us the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the
	VIEs&#146; economic performance. We believe that our ability to exercise effective control, together with the service agreements and the equity pledge agreements, give us the rights to receive substantially all of the economic benefits from the VIEs
	in consideration for the services provided by our wholly-owned subsidiaries in China. Accordingly, as the primary beneficiary of the VIEs and in accordance with U.S. GAAP, we consolidate their financial results and assets and liabilities in our
	consolidated financial statements. In September 2015, the contractual arrangements with Xuncheng Network were terminated, subsequent to which we continued to consolidate Xuncheng Network through voting interest held by New Oriental China.

	In April 2014,
	the Financial Accounting Standards Board (&#147;FASB&#148;) issued a new pronouncement which amends to change the criteria for reporting discontinued operations while enhancing disclosures in this area. It also addresses sources of confusion and
	inconsistent application related to financial reporting of discontinued operations guidance in U.S. GAAP. Under the new guidance, only disposals representing a strategic shift in operations should be presented as discontinued operations. Those
	strategic shifts should have a major effect on the organization&#146;s operations and financial results. Examples include a disposal of a major geographic area, a major line of business, or a major equity method investment. In addition, the new
	guidance requires expanded disclosures about discontinued operations that will provide financial statement users with more information about the assets, liabilities, income, and expenses of discontinued operations. The new guidance also requires
	disclosure of the pre-tax income attributable to a disposal of a significant part of an organization that does not qualify for discontinued operations reporting. This disclosure will provide users with information about the ongoing trends in a
	reporting organization&#146;s results from continuing operations. The amendments are effective for public business entities for fiscal years, and for interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December&nbsp;15, 2014. Early adoption
	is permitted. We adopted this ASU on June&nbsp;1, 2015 and the effects of the pronouncement have been reflected in the consolidated financial statements.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	In November, 2015, the FASB issued a new pronouncement which changes how deferred taxes are classified on organizations&#146; balance sheets. The ASU
	eliminates the current requirement for organizations to present deferred tax liabilities and assets as current and noncurrent in a classified balance sheet. Instead, organizations will be required to classify all deferred tax assets and liabilities
	as noncurrent. The amendments apply to all organizations that present a classified balance sheet. For public companies, the amendments are effective for financial statements issued for annual periods beginning after December&nbsp;15, 2016, and
	interim periods within those annual periods. Earlier application is permitted for all entities as of the beginning of an interim or annual reporting period. This ASU may be applied prospectively to all deferred tax liabilities and assets or
	retrospectively to all periods presented. We elected to early adopt this new guidance on a prospective basis and have applied the changes to all deferred tax liabilities and assets and to the consolidated balance sheet as of May&nbsp;31, 2016. We
	did not retrospectively apply the changes to prior periods.

	In May 2014, FASB issued a new pronouncement which affects any entity using U.S. GAAP that either enters into contracts with customers to transfer goods or
	services or enters into contracts for the transfer of nonfinancial assets unless those contracts are within the scope of other standards (e.g., insurance contracts or lease contracts). This ASU will supersede the revenue recognition requirements in
	Topic 605, Revenue Recognition, and most industry-specific guidance. This ASU also supersedes some cost guidance included in Subtopic 605-35, Revenue Recognition&#151;Construction-Type and Production-Type Contracts. In addition, the existing
	requirements for the recognition of a gain or loss on the transfer of nonfinancial assets that are not in a contract with a customer (e.g., assets within the scope of Topic 360, Property, Plant, and Equipment, and intangible assets within the scope

	In June 2014, the FASB issued a new pronouncement which requires that a performance target that affects vesting and that could be achieved after the requisite
	service period be treated as a performance condition. A reporting entity should apply existing guidance in Topic 718, Compensation&#151;Stock Compensation, as it relates to awards with performance conditions that affect vesting to account for such
	awards. The performance target should not be reflected in estimating the grant-date fair value of the award. Compensation cost should be recognized in the period in which it becomes probable that the performance target will be achieved and should
	represent the compensation cost attributable to the period(s) for which the requisite service has already been rendered. If the performance target becomes probable of being achieved before the end of the requisite service period, the remaining
	unrecognized compensation cost should be recognized prospectively over the remaining requisite service period. The total amount of compensation cost recognized during and after the requisite service period should reflect the number of awards that
	are expected to vest and should be adjusted to reflect those awards that ultimately vest. The requisite service period ends when the employee can cease rendering service and still be eligible to vest in the award if the performance target is
	achieved. The amendments in this ASU are effective for annual periods and interim periods within those annual periods beginning after December&nbsp;15, 2015. Earlier adoption is permitted. Entities may apply the amendments in this ASU either:
	(a)&nbsp;prospectively to all awards granted or modified after the effective date; or (b)&nbsp;retrospectively to all awards with performance targets that are outstanding as of the beginning of the earliest annual period presented in the financial
	statements and to all new or modified awards thereafter. If retrospective transition is adopted, the cumulative effect of applying this ASU as of the beginning of the earliest annual period presented in the financial statements should be recognized
	as an adjustment to the opening retained earnings balance at that date. In addition, if retrospective transition is adopted, an entity may use hindsight in measuring and recognizing the compensation cost. We do not expect the adoption of this
	pronouncement will have a significant effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations.

	In September 2015, the FASB issued a new pronouncement ASU 2015-16, Business Combinations (Topic 805): Simplifying the Accounting for Measurement-Period
	Adjustments. To simplify the accounting for adjustments made to provisional amounts recognized in a business combination, the amendments eliminate the requirement to retrospectively account for those adjustments. Under this ASU, an acquirer must
	recognize adjustments to provisional amounts that are identified during the measurement period in the reporting period in which the adjustment amounts are determined. The ASU also requires acquirers to present separately on the face of the income
	statement, or disclose in the notes, the portion of the amount recorded in current-period earnings by line item that would have been recorded in previous reporting periods if the adjustment to the provisional amounts had been recognized as of the
	acquisition date. For public business entities, the ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December&nbsp;15, 2015, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The ASU must be applied prospectively to adjustments to provisional

	had been held. The amendments require that the equity method investor add the cost of acquiring the additional interest in the investee to the current basis of the investor&#146;s previous held interest and adopt the equity method of accounting as
	of the date the investment becomes qualified for equity method accounting. Therefore, upon qualifying for the equity method of accounting, no retroactive adjustment of the investment is required. The amendments require that an entity that has an
	available-for-sale equity security that becomes qualified for the equity method of accounting recognize through earnings the unrealized holding gain or loss in accumulated other comprehensive income at the date the investment becomes qualified for
	use of the equity method. The amendments are effective for all entities for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December&nbsp;15, 2016. The amendments should be applied prospectively upon their effective date

	In May 2016, the FASB issued
	a new pronouncement ASU 2016-12 which provides clarifying guidance in certain narrow areas and add some practical expedients as discussed below. The amendments clarify the objective of the collectability criterion in Step 1. The objective of this
	assessment is to determine whether the contract is valid and represents a substantive transaction on the basis of whether a customer has the ability and intention to pay the promised consideration in exchange for the goods or services that will be
	transferred to the customer. The amendments also add a new criterion to paragraph 606-10-25-7 to clarify when revenue would be recognized for a contract that fails to meet the criteria in Step 1. That criterion allows an entity to recognize revenue
	in the amount of consideration received when the entity has transferred control of the goods or services, the entity has stopped transferring goods or services (if applicable) and has no obligation under the contract to transfer additional goods or
	services, and the consideration received from the customer is nonrefundable. The amendments permit an entity, as an accounting policy election, to exclude amounts collected from customers for all sales (and other similar) taxes from the transaction
	price. The amendments specify that the measurement date for noncash consideration is contract inception. The amendments also clarify that the variable consideration guidance applies only to variability resulting from reasons other than the form of
	the consideration. The amendments provide a practical expedient that permits an entity to reflect the aggregate effect of all modifications that occur before the beginning of the earliest period presented when identifying the satisfied and
	unsatisfied performance obligations, determining the transaction price, and allocating the transaction price to the satisfied and unsatisfied performance obligations. The amendments clarify that a completed contract for purposes of transition is a
	contract for which all (or substantially all) of the revenue was recognized under legacy GAAP before the date of initial application. Accounting for elements of a contract that do not affect revenue under legacy GAAP are irrelevant to the assessment
	of whether a contract is complete. In addition, the amendments permit an entity to apply the modified retrospective transition method either to all contracts or only to contracts that are not completed contracts. The amendments clarify that an
	entity that retrospectively applies the guidance in Topic 606 to each prior reporting period is not required to disclose the effect of the accounting change for the period of adoption. However, an entity is still required to disclose the effect of
	the changes on any prior periods retrospectively adjusted. The effective date and transition of these amendments is the same as the effective date and transition of ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606). We are in the
	process of evaluating the impact of adoption of this pronouncement on our consolidated financial statements.

	In August 2016, the FASB issued new pronouncements ASU 2016-15, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230):
	Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments. The amendments in this Update provide guidance on the following specific cash flow issues such as:(1) Contingent Consideration Payments Made after a Business Combination;
	(2)&nbsp;Distributions Received from Equity Method Investees. The amendments in this Update are effective for public business entities for fiscal years beginning after December&nbsp;15, 2017, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early
	adoption is permitted, including adoption in an interim period. An entity that elects early adoption must adopt all of the amendments in the same period. We do not expect the adoption of this pronouncement will have a significant effect on its
	consolidated financial position or results of operations.

	Our principal source of liquidity has been cash generated from
	operating activities. As of May&nbsp;31, 2016, we had US$709.2 million in cash and cash equivalents. Our cash and cash equivalents consist of cash on hand and liquid investments that are unrestricted as to withdrawal or use, have maturities of three
	months or less and are placed with banks and other financial institutions. Although we consolidate the results of New Oriental China and its schools and subsidiaries, we do not have direct access to the cash and cash equivalents or future earnings
	of New Oriental China. However, a portion of the cash balances of New Oriental China and its schools and subsidiaries are paid to our wholly-owned subsidiaries in China pursuant to contractual arrangements for the services our subsidiaries provide

	We expect to require cash to fund our ongoing business needs, particularly the rent and other
	costs and expenses relating to opening new schools and learning centers. We opened 109 new learning centers and closed 85 existing centers in fiscal year 2016. We plan to continue to add schools and learning centers in the future with a focus on
	opening new learning centers in fast growing, high profit margin cities. We expect to incur capital expenditures ranging from approximately RMB1.0 million (US$0.1 million) to RMB4.0 million (US$0.6 million) per new school depending primarily on the
	size and geographic location of the school. Other cash needs include acquisitions of businesses and properties that complement our operations when suitable opportunities arise. We have not encountered any difficulties in meeting our cash obligations
	to date. We believe that our current cash and cash equivalents and anticipated cash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for the foreseeable future.

	We are a holding company with no material
	operations of our own. We conduct substantially all of our education business in China through contractual arrangements with New Oriental China, our variable interest entity, and its schools and subsidiaries and shareholder. See &#147;Item 4.
	Information on the Company&#151;C. Organizational Structure&#151;Contractual Arrangements with New Oriental China, Its Schools and Subsidiaries and Its Shareholder&#148; for a summary of these contractual arrangements. In the fiscal year ended
	May&nbsp;31, 2015, we entered into a series of contractual arrangements with Xuncheng Network, a then wholly-owned subsidiary of New Oriental China, its subsidiaries and its shareholder as part of an internal restructuring. Following a change in our
	restructuring strategy, these contractual arrangements were terminated in September 2015. See &#147;Item 4. Information on the Company&#151;C. Organizational Structure&#151;Contractual Arrangements with Xuncheng Network, Its Subsidiary and Its
	Shareholder&#148; for a summary of these contractual arrangements. In the fiscal years ended May&nbsp;31, 2014, 2015 and 2016, our variable interest entity(ies) contributed in aggregate 98.4%, 97.9% and 97.7%, respectively, of our total net
	revenues. Our operations not conducted through contractual arrangements with our variable interest entity(ies) primarily consist of our kindergarten programs and the leasing of our commercial property. As of May&nbsp;31, 2015 and 2016, our variable
	interest entity(ies) accounted for an aggregate of 64.8% and 69.8%, respectively, of our total assets, and 92.7% and 93.7%, respectively, of our total liabilities. The assets not associated with our variable interest entity(ies) primarily consist of
	cash and cash equivalents, term deposits and short-term investments. As of May&nbsp;31, 2015 and 2016, US$90.7 million and US$51.9 million, respectively, of these assets were denominated in U.S. dollars, and $283.3 million and US$317.6 million,
	respectively, of these assets were denominated in RMB.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	As a holding company, our ability to pay dividends and other cash distributions to our
	shareholders depends in part upon dividends and other distributions paid to us by our PRC subsidiaries. The amount of dividends paid by our PRC subsidiaries to us primarily depends on the service fees paid to our PRC subsidiaries from our variable
	interest entity(ies), and, to a lesser degree, our PRC subsidiaries&#146; retained earnings. As of May&nbsp;31, 2014, 2015 and 2016, the total amount of service fees payable to our PRC subsidiaries from our variable interest entity(ies) under the
	service agreements was US$123.7 million, US$29.4 million and US$262.7 million, respectively. Conducting our operations through contractual arrangements with our variable interest entity(ies) entails a risk that we may lose the power to direct the
	activities that most significantly affect the economic performance of our variable interest entity(ies), which may result in our being unable to consolidate their financial results with our results and may impair our access to their cash flow from
	operations and thereby reduce our liquidity. See &#147;Item 3. Risk Factors&#151;D. Risks Related to Our Corporate Structure&#148; for more information, including the risk factors titled &#147;If the PRC government finds that the agreements that
	establish the structure for operating our China business do not comply with applicable PRC laws and regulations, we could be subject to severe penalties&#148; and &#147;We rely on contractual arrangements for our operations in China, which may not
	be as effective in providing operational control as direct ownership.&#148;

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Under PRC law, each of our PRC subsidiaries, New Oriental China and its subsidiaries which is not a school is required to set aside at least 10% of its
	after-tax profits each year, if any, to fund a statutory surplus reserve until such reserve reaches 50% of its registered capital and to further set aside a portion of its after-tax profit to fund the reserve fund at the discretion of our board of
	directors. Although the statutory reserves can be used, among other ways, to increase the registered capital and eliminate future losses in excess of retained earnings of the respective companies, the reserve funds are not distributable as cash
	dividends except in the event of liquidation. In addition, at the end of each fiscal year, each of our schools in China is required to allocate a certain amount out of its annual net income, if any, to its development fund for the construction or
	maintenance of the school or procurement or upgrade of educational equipment. For our schools which have elected to require reasonable returns, this amount shall be no less than 25% of the annual net income of the school, and for our schools which
	have elected not to require reasonable returns, this amount shall be equivalent to no less than 25% of the annual increase in the net assets of the school, if any. Our PRC subsidiaries are permitted to pay dividends to us only out of their retained
	earnings, if any, as determined in accordance with PRC accounting standards and regulations.

	Pursuant to contractual arrangements that our wholly-owned subsidiaries in China have with New Oriental China,

	appropriations for its statutory reserve requirement, the remaining net profits of our PRC subsidiaries would be available for distribution to three Hong Kong-incorporated intermediate holding companies wholly owned by our company, and from these
	three Hong Kong-incorporated intermediate holding companies to our company. See &#147;Item 4. Information on the Company&#151;C. Organizational Structure&#148; for a diagram of our corporate structure. As of May&nbsp;31, 2016, the net assets of our
	PRC subsidiaries and New Oriental China and its schools and subsidiaries which were restricted due to statutory reserve requirements and other applicable laws and regulations, and thus not available for distribution, were in aggregate US$359.0
	million, and the net assets of our PRC subsidiaries and New Oriental China and its schools and subsidiaries which were unrestricted and thus available for distribution were in aggregate US$1,133.2 million. We do not believe that these restrictions
	on the distribution of our net assets will have a significant impact on our ability to timely meet our financial obligations in the future. See &#147;Item 3. Key Information&#151;D. Risk Factors&#151;Risks Related to Doing Business in China&#151;We
	may rely on dividends and other distributions on equity paid by our wholly-owned subsidiaries to fund any cash and financing requirements we may have, and any limitation on the ability of our subsidiaries and New Oriental China and its schools and

	The expansion of our network of

	Our capital expenditures are incurred primarily in connection with facility acquisitions, leasehold improvements and investments in equipment, technology and operating systems. Our capital expenditures for the fiscal year ended May&nbsp;31, 2016
	were primarily due to our investments in facilities, equipment, technology and operating systems to meet the expected growth of our operations. We intend to cost-efficiently allocate our capital resources by leasing most of our new facilities in the
	foreseeable future. We may also make acquisitions of businesses and properties that complement our operations when suitable opportunities arise. We believe that we will be able to fund our capital needs in the foreseeable future through cash
	generated from our operating activities.

	Our board of directors currently consists of six directors, which consist of three
	independent directors and three directors who are, or have been within the past three years, also our executive officers. Section&nbsp;303A.01 of the NYSE Listed Company Manual requires each listed company to have a majority of independent directors
	on the board of directors after the first anniversary of the company&#146;s listing on the NYSE. We are not required under the laws of the Cayman Islands to have a majority of independent directors on our board of directors. Pursuant to the
	exception granted to foreign private issuers under Section&nbsp;303A.00 of the NYSE Listed Company Manual, we have elected to follow our home country practice with respect to our board of directors. A director is not required to hold any shares in
	the company by way of qualification. A director may vote with respect to any contract, proposed contract or arrangement in which he is materially interested. A director may exercise all the powers of the company to borrow money, mortgage its
	undertaking, property and uncalled capital, and issue debentures or other securities whenever money is borrowed or as security for any obligation of the company or of any third party. Our independent directors hold executive sessions, during which
	only the independent directors are present, at least once a year. Depending on the nature of the discussion at an executive session, each of the three independent directors may preside at the executive sessions. In the fiscal year ended May&nbsp;31,
	2016, our board held meetings or passed resolutions by unanimous written consent 15 times.

	On April&nbsp;17, 2012, our board of directors declared a special cash dividend in the amount of US$0.30 per ADS. The cash dividend was paid on
	September&nbsp;28, 2012 to shareholders of record at the close of business on August&nbsp;31, 2012. The aggregate amount of cash dividends paid was US$47.0 million, which was funded by surplus cash on our balance sheet. On July&nbsp;23, 2013, our
	board of directors declared a special cash dividend in the amount of US$0.35 per ADS. The cash dividend was paid on October&nbsp;7, 2013 to shareholders of record at the close of business on September&nbsp;6, 2013. The aggregate amount of cash
	dividends paid was US$54.5 million, which was funded by surplus cash on our balance sheet. On July&nbsp;21, 2015, our board of directors declared a special cash dividend in the amount of US$0.4 per ADS. The cash dividend was paid in October 2015 to
	shareholders of record at the close of business on September&nbsp;4, 2015. The aggregate amount of cash dividends paid was approximately US$62.7 million.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Other than the declaration of the special cash dividend described in the preceding paragraph, we have not declared any dividend since the completion of our
	initial public offering and have no present intention to declare any additional dividends on our shares in the future. We currently intend to retain all of our available funds and any future earnings to operate and expand our business and we have no
	plan to repatriate the remaining undistributed earnings from our subsidiaries in China. For the part of the dividend declared on July&nbsp;23, 2013 that needs to be funded through dividend from our subsidiaries in China, we paid the PRC withholding
	tax.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	We are a holding company incorporated in the Cayman Islands. We rely on dividends from our subsidiaries in China and consulting, license and other
	fees paid to us by New Oriental China and its schools and subsidiaries. Current PRC regulations permit our subsidiaries to pay dividends to us only out of their accumulated profits, if any, determined in accordance with PRC accounting standards and
	regulations. In addition, each of our PRC subsidiaries and New Oriental China and its subsidiaries are required to set aside at least 10% of its after-tax profits each year, if any, to fund a statutory reserve until such reserve reaches 50% of its
	registered capital, and to further set aside a portion of its after-tax profits to fund the employee welfare fund at the discretion of the board. These reserves may not be distributed as cash dividends. Further, if our PRC subsidiaries or New
	Oriental China and its schools and subsidiaries incur debt on their own behalf in the future, the instruments governing the debt may restrict their ability to pay dividends or make other payments to us. Moreover, at the end of each fiscal year,
	every private school in China is required to allocate a certain amount out of its annual net income, if any, to its development fund for the construction or maintenance of the school or procurement or upgrade of educational equipment. In the case of
	a private school that requires reasonable returns, this amount shall be no less than 25% of the annual net income of the school, while in the case of a private school that does not require reasonable returns, this amount shall be equivalent to no
	less than 25% of the annual increase in the net assets of the school, if any.

	Holders of the common shares may affect certain changes by ordinary resolution, including increasing the amount of our authorized share capital, consolidating and dividing all or any of our share capital into shares of a larger amount than our
	existing share capital, and canceling any shares.

	board of directors may reasonably require to show the right of the transferor to make the transfer; (2)&nbsp;the instrument of transfer is in respect of only one class of common shares; (3)&nbsp;the instrument of transfer is duly and properly

	If our directors refuse to register a transfer they shall, within two months after the date on which the instrument of transfer was lodged, send to each of
	the transferor and the transferee notice of such refusal. The registration of transfers may, on 14 days&#146; notice being given by advertisement in such one or more newspapers or by electronic means, be suspended and the register closed at such

	Differences in Corporate Law
</B>
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The Companies Law is derived, to a large extent, from the older Companies Acts of England but does not follow recent statutory enactments in England. In
	addition, the Companies Law differs from laws applicable to United States corporations and their shareholders. Set forth below is a summary of the significant differences between the provisions of the Companies Law applicable to us and the laws
	applicable to companies incorporated in the United States.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
<I>
	Mergers and Similar Arrangements
</I>
	. The Companies Law permits mergers and consolidations
	between Cayman Islands companies and between Cayman Islands companies and non-Cayman Islands companies. For these purposes, (a)&nbsp;&#147;merger&#148; means the merging of two or more constituent companies and the vesting of their undertaking,
	property and liabilities in one of such companies as the surviving company and (b)&nbsp;a &#147;consolidation&#148; means the combination of two or more constituent companies into a combined company and the vesting of the undertaking, property and
	liabilities of such companies to the consolidated company. In order to effect such a merger or consolidation, the directors of each constituent company must approve a written plan of merger or consolidation, which must then be authorized by
	(a)&nbsp;a special resolution of the shareholders of each constituent company, and (b)&nbsp;such other authorization, if any, as may be specified in such constituent company&#146;s articles of association.
<I>
</I>
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The written plan of merger or consolidation must be filed with the Registrar of Companies together with a declaration as to the solvency of the consolidated
	or surviving company, a list of the assets and liabilities of each constituent company and an undertaking that a copy of the certificate of merger or consolidation will be given to the members and creditors of each constituent company and that
	notification of the merger or consolidation will be published in the Cayman Islands Gazette. Dissenting shareholders have the right to be paid the fair value of their shares (which, if not agreed between the parties, will be determined by the Cayman
	Islands court) if they follow the required procedures, subject to certain exceptions. Court approval is not required for a merger or consolidation which is effected in compliance with these statutory procedures.

	In addition, there are statutory provisions that facilitate the reconstruction and amalgamation of companies,
	provided that the arrangement is approved by a majority in number of each class of shareholders and creditors with whom the arrangement is to be made, and who must, in addition, represent 75% in value of each such class of shareholders or creditors,
	as the case may be, that are present and voting either in person or by proxy at a meeting, or meetings, convened for that purpose. The convening of the meetings and subsequently the arrangement must be sanctioned by the Grand Court of the Cayman
	Islands. While a dissenting shareholder has the right to express to the court the view that the transaction ought not to be approved, the Grand Court of the Cayman Islands can be expected to approve the arrangement if it determines that (a)&nbsp;the
	statutory provisions as to the required majority vote have been met; (b)&nbsp;the shareholders have been fairly represented at the meeting in question and the statutory majority are acting bona fide without coercion of the minority to promote
	interests adverse to those of the class; (c)&nbsp;the arrangement is such that may be reasonably approved by an intelligent and honest man of that class acting in respect of his interest; and (d)&nbsp;the arrangement is not one that would more
	properly be sanctioned under some other provision of the Companies Law.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">

	When a takeover offer is made and accepted by holders of 90% of the shares affected within four months, the offeror may, within a two-month period
	commencing on the expiration of such four month period, require the holders of the remaining shares to transfer such shares on the terms of the offer. An objection can be made to the Grand Court of the Cayman Islands but this is unlikely to succeed
	in the case of an offer which has been so approved unless there is evidence of fraud, bad faith or collusion.

	Shareholders&#146; Suits
</I>
	. In
	principle, we will normally be the proper plaintiff and as a general rule a derivative action may not be brought by a minority shareholder. However, based on English authorities, which would in all likelihood be of persuasive authority in the Cayman
	Islands, there are exceptions to the foregoing principle, including when (a)&nbsp;a company acts or proposes to act illegally or ultra vires; (b)&nbsp;the act complained of, although not ultra vires, could only be effected duly if authorized by more
	than a simple majority vote that has not been obtained; and (c)&nbsp;those who control the company are perpetrating a &#147;fraud on the minority&#148;.

	Indemnification of Directors and Executive Officers and Limitation of Liability.
</I>
	Cayman Islands law does not limit the extent to which a company&#146;s
	articles of association may provide for indemnification of officers and directors, except to the extent any such provision may be held by the Cayman Islands courts to be contrary to public policy, such as to provide indemnification against civil
	fraud or the consequences of committing a crime. Our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association permit indemnification of officers and directors for losses, damages, costs and expenses incurred in their capacities as such unless
	such losses or damages arise from dishonesty or fraud which may attach to such directors or officers. This standard of conduct is generally the same as permitted under the Delaware General Corporation Law for a Delaware corporation. In addition, we
	intend to enter into indemnification agreements with our directors and senior executive officers that will provide such persons with additional indemnification beyond that provided in our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association.
<I>
</I>
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Insofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act may be permitted to our directors, officers or persons controlling us
	under the foregoing provisions, we have been informed that, in the opinion of the SEC, such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act and is therefore unenforceable.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
<I>
	Anti-Takeover Provisions in the Memorandum and Articles of Association.
</I>
	Some provisions of our amended and restated memorandum and articles of
	association may discourage, delay or prevent a change in control of our company or management that shareholders may consider favorable, including provisions that authorize our board of directors to issue preference shares in one or more series and
	to designate the price, rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions of such preference shares without any further vote or action by our shareholders.

</I>
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	However, under Cayman Islands law, our directors may only exercise the rights and powers granted to them under our memorandum and articles of association, as
	amended and restated from time to time, for what they believe in good faith to be in the best interests of our company.

	Directors&#146; Fiduciary Duties.
</I>
	As a matter of Cayman Islands law, a director of a Cayman Islands
	company is in the position of a fiduciary with respect to the company and therefore it is considered that he owes the following duties to the company&#151;a duty to act bona fide in the best interests of the company, a duty not to make a profit
	based on his or her position as director (unless the company permits him to do so) and a duty not to put himself in a position
<I>
</I>
	where the interests of the company conflict with his or her personal interest or his or her duty to a third party.
	A director of a Cayman Islands company owes to the company a duty to act with skill and care. It was previously considered that a director need not exhibit in the performance of his or her duties a greater degree of skill than may reasonably be
	expected from a person of his or her knowledge and experience. However, English and Commonwealth courts have moved towards an objective standard with regard to the required skill and care and these authorities are likely to be followed in the Cayman
	Islands.
<I>
</I>
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	In addition, directors of a Cayman Islands company must not place themselves in a position in which there is a conflict between their
	duty to the company and their personal interests. However, this obligation may be varied by the company&#146;s articles of association, which may permit a director to vote on a matter in which he has a personal interest provided that he has
	disclosed that nature of his interest to the board. Our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association provides that a director with an interest (direct or indirect) in a contract or arrangement or proposed contract or arrangement with
	the company must declare the nature of his interest at the meeting of the board of directors at which the question of entering into the contract or arrangement is first considered, if he knows his interest then exists, or in any other case at the
	first meeting of the board of directors after he is or has become so interested.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	A general notice may be given at a meeting of the board of directors to
	the effect that (i)&nbsp;the director is a member/officer of a specified company or firm and is to be regarded as interested in any contract or arrangement which may after the date of the notice in writing be made with that company or firm; or
	(ii)&nbsp;he is to be regarded as interested in any contract or arrangement which may after the date of the notice in writing to the board of directors be made with a specified person who is connected with him, will be deemed sufficient declaration
	of interest. Following the disclosure being made pursuant to our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association and subject to any separate requirement for Audit Committee approval under applicable law or the listing rules of the NYSE,
	and unless disqualified by the chairman of the relevant board meeting, a director may vote in respect of any contract or arrangement in which such director is interested and may be counted in the quorum at such meeting. However, even if a director
	discloses his interest and is therefore permitted to vote, he must still comply with his duty to act bona fide in the best interest of our company.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	In
	comparison, under Delaware corporate law, a director of a Delaware corporation has a fiduciary duty to the corporation and its shareholders. This duty has two components: the duty of care and the duty of loyalty. The duty of care requires that a
	director act in good faith, with the care that an ordinarily prudent person would exercise under similar circumstances. Under this duty, a director must inform himself of, and disclose to shareholders, all material information reasonably available
	regarding a significant transaction. The duty of loyalty requires that a director act in a manner he or she reasonably believes to be in the best interests of the corporation. He or she must not use his or her corporate position for personal gain or
	advantage. This duty prohibits self-dealing by a director and mandates that the best interest of the corporation and its shareholders take precedence over any interest possessed by a director, officer or controlling shareholder and not shared by the
	shareholders generally. In general, actions of a director are presumed to have been made on an informed basis, in good faith and in the honest belief that the action taken was in the best interests of the corporation. However, this presumption may
	be rebutted by evidence of a breach of one of the fiduciary duties. Should such evidence be presented concerning a transaction by a director, a director must prove the procedural fairness of the transaction, and that the transaction was of fair
	value to the corporation.

	Shareholder Proposals.
</I>
	Under the Delaware General Corporation Law, a shareholder has the right to put any proposal
	before the annual meeting of shareholders, provided it complies with the notice provisions in the governing documents. The Delaware General Corporation Law does not provide shareholders an express right to put any proposal before the annual meeting
	of shareholders, but in keeping with common law, Delaware corporations generally afford shareholders an opportunity to make proposals and nominations provided that they comply with the notice provisions in the certificate of incorporation or bylaws.
	A special meeting may be called by the board of directors or any other person authorized to do so in the governing documents, but shareholders may be precluded from calling special meetings.

	There are no statutory requirements under Cayman Islands law allowing our shareholders to requisition a shareholders&#146; meeting. However, under our amended
	and restated articles of association, on the requisition of shareholders representing not less than 33% of the voting rights entitled to vote at general meetings, the board shall convene an extraordinary general meeting. As an exempted Cayman
	Islands company, we are not obliged by law to call shareholders&#146; annual general meetings, and our amended and restated articles of association does not require us to call such meetings every year.

	Cumulative Voting.
</I>
	Under the Delaware General Corporation Law, cumulative voting for elections of
	directors is not permitted unless the corporation&#146;s certificate of incorporation specifically provides for it. Cumulative voting potentially facilitates the representation of minority shareholders on a board of directors since it permits the
	minority shareholder to cast all the votes to which the shareholder is entitled on a single director, which increases the shareholder&#146;s voting power with respect to electing such director. As permitted under Cayman Islands law, our amended and
	restated articles of association do not provide for cumulative voting. As a result, our shareholders are not afforded any less protections or rights on this issue than shareholders of a Delaware corporation.

	Transactions with Interested Shareholders.
</I>
	The Delaware General Corporation Law contains a business combination statute
	applicable to Delaware public corporations whereby, unless the corporation has specifically elected not to be governed by such statute by amendment to its certificate of incorporation or bylaws that is approved by its shareholders, it is prohibited
	from engaging in certain business combinations with an &#147;interested shareholder&#148; for three years following the date that such person becomes an interested shareholder. An interested shareholder generally is a person or a group who or which
	owns or owned 15% or more of the target&#146;s outstanding voting stock or who or which is an affiliate or associate of the corporation and owned 15% or more of the corporation&#146;s outstanding voting stock within the past three years. This has
	the effect of limiting the ability of a potential acquirer to make a two-tiered bid for the target in which all shareholders would not be treated equally. The statute does not apply if, among other things, prior to the date on which such shareholder
	becomes an interested shareholder, the board of directors approves either the business combination or the transaction which resulted in the person becoming an interested shareholder. This encourages any potential acquirer of a Delaware corporation
	to negotiate the terms of any acquisition transaction with the target&#146;s board of directors.
<I>
</I>
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Cayman Islands law has no comparable statute. As
	a result, we cannot avail ourselves of the types of protections afforded by the Delaware business combination statute. However, although Cayman Islands law does not regulate transactions between a company and its significant shareholders, it does
	provide that such transactions must be entered into bona fide in the best interests of the company and for a proper corporate purpose and not with the effect of constituting a fraud on the minority shareholders.

	Dissolution; Winding Up.

	Under the Delaware General Corporation Law, unless the board of directors approves the proposal to dissolve, dissolution must
	be approved by shareholders holding 100% of the total voting power of the corporation. Only if the dissolution is initiated by the board of directors may it be approved by a simple majority of the corporation&#146;s outstanding shares. Delaware law
	allows a Delaware corporation to include in its certificate of incorporation a supermajority voting requirement in connection with dissolutions initiated by the board. Under Cayman Islands law, a company may be wound up by either an order of the
	courts of the Cayman Islands or by a special resolution of its members or, if the company is unable to pay its debts as they fall due, by an ordinary resolution of its members. The court has authority to order winding up in a number of specified
	circumstances including where it is, in the opinion of the court, just and equitable to do so.

	PRC Taxation
</B>
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Under the PRC Enterprise Income Tax Law, or the EIT Law, and its implementation rules that became effective on January&nbsp;1, 2008, a non-resident enterprise
	is generally subject to PRC enterprise income tax with respect to PRC-sourced income. A circular issued by the State Administration of Taxation on April&nbsp;22, 2009 provides that a foreign enterprise controlled by a PRC company or a PRC company
	group will be classified as a &#147;resident enterprise&#148; with its &#147;de facto management body&#148; located within China if the following requirements are satisfied: (i)&nbsp;the senior management and core management departments in charge of
	its daily operations function are mainly in the PRC; (ii)&nbsp;its financial and human resources decisions are subject to determination or approval by persons or bodies in the PRC; (iii)&nbsp;its major assets, accounting books, company seals, and
	minutes and files of its board and shareholders&#146; meetings are located or kept in the PRC; and (iv)&nbsp;at least half of the enterprise&#146;s directors with voting right or senior management reside in the PRC. In addition, the State
	Administration of Taxation issued a bulletin on August&nbsp;3, 2011, effective as of September&nbsp;1, 2011, to provide more guidance on the implementation of the above circular. The bulletin clarified certain matters relating to resident status
	determination, post-determination administration and competent tax authorities. It also specifies that when provided with a copy of a PRC tax resident determination certificate from a resident PRC-controlled offshore incorporated enterprise, the
	payer should not withhold 10% income tax when paying the PRC-sourced dividends, interest and royalties to the PRC-controlled offshore incorporated enterprise. Although both the circular and the bulletin only apply to offshore enterprises controlled
	by PRC enterprises and not those by PRC individuals, the determination criteria set forth in the circular and administration clarification made in the bulletin may reflect the State Administration of Taxation&#146;s general position on how the
	&#147;de facto management body&#148; test should be applied in determining the tax residency status of offshore enterprises and the administration measures should be implemented, regardless of whether they are controlled by PRC enterprises or PRC
	individuals. In addition, the SAT issued a bulletin on January&nbsp;29, 2014, to provide more guidance on the implementation of the above circular. This bulletin further provided that, among other things, an entity that is classified as a
	&#147;resident enterprise&#148; in accordance with the circular shall file the application for classifying its status of residential enterprise with the local tax authorities where its main domestic investors registered. From the year in which the
	entity is determined as a &#147;resident enterprise&#148;, any dividend, profit and other equity investment gain shall be taxed in accordance with the Article 26 of EIT law and the Article 17 and Article 83 of its implementation rules. If we are
	deemed to be a PRC resident enterprise, dividends distributed to our non-PRC enterprise shareholders by us, or the gain our non-PRC enterprise shareholders may realize from the transfer of our common shares or ADSs, may be treated as PRC-sourced
	income and therefore be subject to a 10% PRC withholding tax pursuant to the EIT Law.

	Subject to the passive foreign investment company rules discussed below, a U.S. Holder will recognize taxable gain or loss on any sale, exchange or other
	taxable disposition of an ADS or common share equal to the difference between the amount realized for the ADS or common share and such holder&#146;s tax basis in the ADS or common share. The gain or loss generally will be capital gain or loss. A
	non-corporate U.S. Holder, including an individual, who has held the ADS or common share for more than one year will be eligible for reduced capital gains rates. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations. Any such gain or loss
	generally will be treated as U.S. source income or loss. In the event that we are deemed to be a PRC resident enterprise under the EIT Law and gain from the disposition of the ADSs or common shares is subject to tax in the PRC, a U.S. Holder that is

	Although the law in this regard is unclear, we treat New Oriental China as being owned by us for U.S. federal
	income tax purposes, not only because we control its management decisions but also because we are entitled to substantially all of the economic benefits associated with this entity, and, as a result, we consolidate this entity&#146;s operating
	results in our combined financial statements. If it were determined, however, that we are not the owner of New Oriental China for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we may be or become a PFIC. Assuming that we are the owner of New Oriental China for
	United States federal income tax purposes, and based upon an analysis of the Company&#146;s income and assets in respect of the 2016 taxable year, we do not believe that we were a PFIC, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, for the taxable year
	ended May&nbsp;31, 2016. In light of the amount of our cash balances and because the value of our assets for purposes of the PFIC test will generally be determined by reference to the market value of our ADSs, the determination of whether we will be
	or become a PFIC will depend in large part upon the market value of our ADSs, which we cannot control. Accordingly, fluctuations in the market price of our ADSs may cause us to become a PFIC for the current taxable year or future taxable years. It
	is also possible, that the United States Internal Revenue Service may challenge our classification or valuation of our goodwill and other unbooked intangibles, which may result in our company being, or becoming a PFIC. The determination of whether
	we will be or become a PFIC will also depend, in part, upon the nature of our assets and income over time, which are subject to change from year to year. There can be no assurance our business plans will not change in a manner that will affect the
	composition of our income and assets and our PFIC status. Because there are uncertainties in the application of the relevant rules and PFIC status is a fact-intensive determination made on an annual basis, no assurance can be given that we are not

	A U.S. Holder of &#147;marketable stock&#148; (as defined below) in a PFIC may make a mark-to-market election for
	such stock to elect out of the tax treatment discussed above. If a U.S. Holder makes a mark-to-market election for the ADSs or common shares, such holder will include in income for each year that we are treated as a PFIC with respect to such holder
	an amount equal to the excess, if any, of the fair market value of the ADSs or common shares as of the close of your taxable year over the holder&#146;s adjusted basis in such ADSs or common shares. A U.S. Holder will be allowed a deduction for the
	excess, if any, of the adjusted basis of the ADSs or common shares over their fair market value as of the close of the taxable year. However, deductions will be allowable only to the extent of any net mark-to-market gains on the ADSs or common
	shares included in a U.S. Holder&#146;s income for prior taxable years. Amounts included in a U.S. Holder&#146;s income under a mark-to-market election, as well as gain on the actual sale or other disposition of the ADSs or common shares, will be
	treated as ordinary income. Ordinary loss treatment will also apply to the deductible portion of any mark-to-market loss on the ADSs or common shares, as well as to any loss realized on the actual sale or disposition of the ADSs or common shares, to
	the extent that the amount of such loss does not exceed the net mark-to-market gains previously included for such ADSs or common shares. A U.S. Holder&#146;s basis in the ADSs or common shares will be adjusted to reflect any such income or loss
	amounts. If a U.S. Holder makes a valid mark-to-market election, the tax rules that apply to distributions by corporations which are not PFICs would apply to distributions by us, except that the lower capital gains rate applicable to qualified
	dividend income (discussed above under &#147;&#151;Taxation of Distributions on the ADSs or Common Shares&#148;) would not apply.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The mark-to-market
	election is available only for &#147;marketable stock,&#148; which is stock that is traded in other than de minimis quantities on at least 15 days during each calendar quarter (&#147;regularly traded&#148;) on a qualified exchange or other market,
	as defined in applicable United States Treasury regulations. Our ADSs are listed on the NYSE, which is a qualified exchange or market for these purposes. Consequently, if the ADSs continue to be listed on the NYSE and are regularly traded, and a
	U.S. Holder holds ADSs, we expect that the mark-to-market election would be available to such U.S. Holder were we to be or become a PFIC although there can be no assurance in this regard. Because a mark-to-market election cannot be made for equity
	interests in any lower-tier PFICs that we own, a U.S. Holder may continue to be subject to the PFIC rules with respect to its indirect interest in any investments held by us that are treated as an equity interest in a PFIC for U.S. federal income
	tax purposes. In the case of a U.S. Holder who has held ADSs or common shares during any taxable year in respect of which we were classified as a PFIC and continues to hold such ADSs or common shares (or any portion thereof) and has not previously
	determined to make a mark-to-market election, and who is now considering making a mark-to-market election, special tax rules may apply relating to purging the PFIC taint of such ADSs or common shares.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Alternatively, a U.S. Holder of stock in a PFIC may make a &#147;qualified electing fund&#148; or &#147;QEF&#148; election with respect to such PFIC to elect
	out of the tax treatment discussed above. A U.S. Holder that makes a valid QEF election with respect to a PFIC will generally include in gross income for a taxable year such holder&#146;s pro rata share of the corporation&#146;s earnings and profits
	for the taxable year. However, the qualified electing fund election is available only if the PFIC provides such U.S. Holder with certain information regarding its earnings and profits as required under applicable United States Treasury regulations.
	We do not intend to prepare or provide the information that would enable a U.S. Holder to make a QEF election. Accordingly, U.S. Holders should assume that the QEF Election will not be available.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	If a U.S. Holder holds ADSs or common shares in any year in which we are treated as a PFIC with respect to such U.S. Holder, the U.S. Holder will generally be
	required to file United States Internal Revenue Service Form 8621 and such other form as is required by the United States Treasury Department. U.S. Holders are urged to consult their tax advisor regarding the application of the PFIC rules to their
	ownership or disposition of our ADSs or common shares.

	The United States tax compliance rules generally impose reporting requirements on individual U.S. Holders and other specified entities with respect to their
	beneficial ownership of a non-United States company, including our ADSs or common shares, if such interests are not held on their behalf by a U.S. financial institution and other criteria are met. These rules also impose penalties if an individual
	U.S. Holder is required to submit such information to the United States Internal Revenue Service and fails to do so. In addition, U.S. Holders may be subject to information reporting to the United States Internal Revenue Service with respect to
	dividends on and proceeds from the sale or other disposition of our ADSs or common shares. U.S. Holders are advised to consult their tax advisors regarding the application of the United States information reporting rules to their particular

	used any derivative financial instruments to manage our interest risk exposure. Interest-earning instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk. We have not been exposed, nor do we anticipate being exposed, to material risks due to changes in
	interest rates. However, our future interest income may be lower than expected due to changes in market interest rates. A hypothetical one percentage point decrease in interest rates would have resulted in a decrease of approximately US$14.5 million
	in our interest income for the year ended May&nbsp;31, 2016.

	general, our exposure to foreign exchange risks should be limited, the value of your investment in our ADSs will be affected by the foreign exchange rate between U.S. dollars and RMB because the value of our business is effectively denominated in
	RMB, while the ADSs are traded in U.S. dollars.

	The value of the Renminbi against the U.S. dollar and other currencies is affected by, among other things,
	changes in China&#146;s political and economic conditions and China&#146;s foreign exchange policies. The conversion of the Renminbi into foreign currencies, including the U.S. dollar, has been based on exchange rates set by the People&#146;s Bank
	of China. The PRC government allowed the Renminbi to appreciate by more than 20% against the U.S. dollar between July 2005 and July 2008. Between July 2008 and June 2010, this appreciation was halted and the exchange rate between the Renminbi and
	the U.S. dollar remained within a narrow band. Since June 2010, the Renminbi has fluctuated against the U.S. dollar, at times significantly and unpredictably. It is difficult to predict how market forces or PRC or U.S. government policy may impact
	the exchange rate between the Renminbi and the U.S. dollar in the future. In addition, there remains significant international pressure on the PRC government to adopt a substantial liberalization of its currency policy, which could result in further
	appreciation in the value of the RMB against the U.S. dollar.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	To the extent that we need to convert U.S. dollar-denominated financial assets into RMB for
	our operations, appreciation of the RMB against the U.S. dollar would have an adverse effect on the RMB amount we receive from the conversion. A hypothetical 10% appreciation of the RMB against the U.S. dollar would have resulted in a decrease of
	RMB66.3 million in the value of our U.S. dollar denominated financial assets as of May&nbsp;31, 2016.

	We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United

	understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other
	procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

	board of directors, management, and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting
	principles. A company&#146;s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1)&nbsp;pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and
	dispositions of the assets of the company; (2)&nbsp;provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts

	Pursuant to the exception granted to foreign private issuers under Section&nbsp;303A.00 of the NYSE Listed Company Manual, we have elected to follow our home country practice with respect to our board of directors. Currently, we have six directors
	on our board, consisting of three independent directors and three directors who are, or have been within the past three years, also our executive officers. Nevertheless, we have maintained fully independent audit, compensation and nominating and

	approval for adoption of new equity-compensation plans or amendments to our existing equity incentive plan. Our board amended our 2006 share incentive plan in September 2012 to clarify that the administrator of the plan has the power to reduce the
	exercise price of an outstanding option and also reduce the number of the underlying common shares without seeking shareholders&#146; approval, if such modification would not result in significant additional share-based compensation expenses to be
	incurred by our company. In addition, our board adopted our 2016 share incentive plan in January 2016. We have followed the home country practice and obtained the board approval but not shareholder approval for amending our 2006 share incentive plan
	as well as adopting the 2016 share incentive plan as described above.

	We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of New Oriental Education&nbsp;&amp; Technology
	Group Inc., its subsidiaries, variable interest entities and their schools and subsidiaries (collectively, the &#147;Group&#148;) as of May&nbsp;31, 2015 and 2016, and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, changes
	in equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended May&nbsp;31, 2016. Our audits also included the financial statement schedule included in Schedule I. These consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedule
	are the responsibility of the Group&#146;s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and financial statement schedule based on our audits.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we
	plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the
	financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable
	basis for our opinion.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the
	Group as of May&nbsp;31, 2015 and 2016, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended May&nbsp;31, 2016, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
	America. Also, in our opinion, such financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the consolidated financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the Group&#146;s internal control
	over financial reporting as of May&nbsp;31, 2016, based on the criteria established in Internal Control&#151;Integrated Framework (2013)&nbsp;issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated
	September&nbsp;27, 2016 expressed an unqualified opinion on the Group&#146;s internal control over financial reporting.

</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; MARGIN-LEFT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	PRC laws and regulations currently require any foreign entity that invests in the education business in China to be an educational institution
	with relevant experience in providing educational services outside China. The Company&#146;s offshore holding companies are not educational institutions and do not provide educational services outside China. In addition, in the PRC, foreign
	ownership of high schools for students in grades ten to twelve is restricted and foreign ownership of primary and middle schools for students in grades one to nine is prohibited. Accordingly, the Company&#146;s offshore holding companies are not
	allowed to directly own and operate schools in China. The Company conducts substantially all of its education business in China through contractual arrangements with its VIEs, New Oriental China and its schools and subsidiaries and Xuncheng and its
	subsidiary. Since the operations of New Oriental China and the schools and Xuncheng and its subsidiary are closely interrelated and almost indistinguishable from one another, the risks and rewards associated with their operations are substantially
	the same. In addition, the Company consolidates New Oriental China, its schools and subsidiaries, Xuncheng and its subsidiary as disclosed. Therefore, the Company aggregates the disclosures related to New Oriental China, New Oriental China&#146;s
	schools and subsidiaries, and Xuncheng and its subsidiary as variable interest entities and referred to them as &#147;the VIEs&#148; in the Company&#146;s consolidated financial statements. The VIEs hold the requisite licenses and permits necessary
	to conduct the Company&#146;s education business. In addition, the VIEs hold leases and other assets necessary to operate the Company&#146;s schools and learning centers, employ teachers and generate substantially all of the Company&#146;s revenues.

	VIE Arrangements between New Oriental China and the Company&#146;s PRC subsidiaries
</B>
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; MARGIN-LEFT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries in China (the &#147;WFOEs&#148;) have entered into the following contractual arrangements with
	New Oriental China, New Oriental China&#146;s schools and subsidiaries and New Oriental China&#146;s shareholders that enable the Company to (1)&nbsp;have power to direct the activities that most significantly affects the economic performance of the
	VIE, and (2)&nbsp;receive the economic benefits of the VIE that could be significant to the VIE. Accordingly, the Company is considered the primary beneficiary of the VIE and has consolidated the VIE&#146; financial results of operations, assets and
	liabilities in the Company&#146;s consolidated financial statements. In making the conclusion that the Company is the primary beneficiary of the VIE, the Company believes the Company&#146;s rights under the terms of the exclusive option agreement
	provide it with a substantive kick out right. More specifically, the Company believes the terms of the exclusive option agreement are valid, binding and enforceable under PRC laws and regulations currently in effect. The Company also believes that
	the minimum amount of consideration permitted by the applicable PRC law to exercise the option does not represent a financial barrier or disincentive for the Company to currently exercise its rights under the exclusive option agreement. A simple
	majority vote of the Company&#146;s board of directors is required to pass a resolution to exercise the Company&#146;s rights under the exclusive option agreement, for which Mr.&nbsp;Michael Minhong Yu (&#147;Mr. Yu&#148;)&#146;s consent is not
	required. The Company&#146;s rights under the exclusive option agreement give the Company the power to control the shareholder of New Oriental China and thus the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the schools&#146;
	economic performance given that New Oriental China has the power to direct the activities of the schools via its sponsorship interest. In addition, the Company&#146;s rights under the power of attorney also reinforce the Company&#146;s abilities to
	direct the activities that most significantly impact the VIE&#146;s economic performance. The Company also believes that this ability to exercise control ensures that the VIE will continue to execute and renew service agreements and pay service fees
	to the Company. By charging service fees in whatever amounts the Company deems fit, and by ensuring that service agreements are executed and renewed indefinitely, the Company has the rights to receive substantially all of the economic benefits from

	The Company&#146;s ability to conduct its education business may be negatively affected if
	the PRC government were to carry out of any of the aforementioned actions. As a result, the Company may not be able to consolidate its VIEs in its consolidated financial statements as it may lose the ability to exert effective control over the VIEs
	and their respective shareholders and it may lose the ability to receive economic benefits from the VIEs. The Company, however, does not believe such actions would result in the liquidation or dissolution of the Company, its PRC subsidiaries or
	VIEs.

	Mr.&nbsp;Yu is the controlling shareholder of Century Friendship, which owns all of the equity interests in New Oriental China,
	which in turn owns all of the equity interests in Xuncheng, and Mr.&nbsp;Yu is also a beneficial owner of the Company. The interests of Mr.&nbsp;Yu as the beneficial owner of the VIEs may differ from the interests of the Company as a whole, since
	Mr.&nbsp;Yu is only one of the beneficial shareholders of the company, holding 15.1% of the total common shares outstanding as of May&nbsp;31, 2016. The Company cannot assure that when conflicts of interest arise, Mr.&nbsp;Yu will act in the best
	interests of the Company or that conflicts of interests will be resolved in the Company&#146;s favor. Currently, the Company does not have existing arrangements to address potential conflicts of interest Mr.&nbsp;Yu may encounter in his capacity as
	a beneficial owner and director of the VIEs, on the one hand, and as a beneficial owner and director of the Company, on the other hand. The Company believes Mr.&nbsp;Yu will not act contrary to any of the contractual arrangements and the exclusive
	option agreement provides the Company with a mechanism to remove Mr.&nbsp;Yu as a beneficial shareholder of the VIEs should he act to the detriment of the Company. The Company relies on Mr.&nbsp;Yu, as a director and executive officer of the
	Company, to fulfill his fiduciary duties and abide by laws of the PRC and Cayman Islands and act in the best interest of the Company. If the Company cannot resolve any conflicts of interest or disputes between the Company and Mr.&nbsp;Yu, the
	Company would have to rely on legal proceedings, which could result in disruption of its business, and there is substantial uncertainty as to the outcome of any such legal proceedings.

	In addition, the current sole shareholder of the New Oriental China is also a beneficial owner of the Company and therefore has no current
	interest in seeking to act contrary to the contractual arrangements. However, to further protect the investors&#146; interest from any risk that the shareholders of the New Oriental China may act contrary to the contractual arrangements, the
	Company, through Beijing Pioneer, entered into an irrevocable power of attorney with Century Friendship on December&nbsp;3, 2012, which replaces the powers of attorney executed by Century Friendship on April&nbsp;23, 2012. Through the power of
	attorney, Century Friendship entrusted Beijing Pioneer as its proxy to exercise its rights as the shareholder of New Oriental China with respect to an aggregate of 100% of the equity interests in New Oriental China.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; MARGIN-LEFT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level on an annual basis (May 31 for the Group) and between annual tests if an event
	occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value. These events or circumstances could include a significant change in the stock prices, business climate, legal factors,

	Application of the
	goodwill impairment test requires judgment, including the identification of reporting units, assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units, assignment of goodwill to reporting units, and determination of the fair value of each reporting
	unit. The estimation of fair value of each reporting unit using a discounted cash flow methodology also requires significant judgments, including estimation of future cash flows, which is dependent on internal forecasts, estimation of the long-term
	rate of growth for the Group&#146;s business, estimation of the useful life over which cash flows will occur, and determination of the Group&#146;s weighted average cost of capital. The estimates used to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit
	change from year to year based on operating results and market conditions. Changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value and goodwill impairment for the reporting unit.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; MARGIN-LEFT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	In order to test goodwill for impairment, the Group first assesses qualitative factors to determine whether it is &#147;more likely than
	not&#148; that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the two-step goodwill impairment test. If it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting
	unit is less than its carrying amount, goodwill is then tested following a two-step process. The first step compares the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying amount, including goodwill. If the fair value of each reporting unit exceeds
	its carrying amount, goodwill is not considered to be impaired and the second step will not be required. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the second step compares the implied fair value of goodwill to the carrying
	value of a reporting unit&#146;s goodwill.

	actual usage of the cards by the students based on the number of minutes the students use the e-learning services, of which the actual usage is tracked by the Group on an individual basis. Upon the expiration of the online-learning card, which
	ranges from six months to one year from the date of sale of the card to the distributor, the Group will recognize the remaining unused minutes as revenue.

	Redeemable preferred shares do not have a quoted market rate. For those, the Company measured their fair value based on recent transactions or
	based on the market approach when no recent transactions are available. Recent transactions include the purchase price agreed by an independent third party for an investment with similar terms or a recent transaction agreed by the Company and the
	investee and has been classified as level 2 measurement. When no recent transactions are available, the Company generally adopts a market approach which takes into consideration a number of factors including market multiple and discount rates from
	traded companies in the industry and requires the Company to make certain assumptions and estimates regarding industry factors. Specifically some of the significant unobservable inputs included the investee&#146;s historical earning on sale,
	discount of lack of marketability, investee&#146;s time to IPO as well as related volatility. The Company has classified those as level 3 measurement. The assumptions are inherently uncertain and subjective. Changes in any unobservable inputs may
	have a significant impact on the fair values.

	Specifically, the Company changed its measurement method from recent transactions to a market approach described in the previous paragraph to determine the investment&#146;s fair value as no recent transactions were available as of May 31, 2016.

	Basic net income per share is computed by dividing income attributable to holders of common shares by the weighted average number of common

	determined based on the difference between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates that will be in effect for the period in which the differences are expected to reverse. The effect on deferred taxes
	of a change in tax rates is recognized in the consolidated statements of operations in the period of change. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when it is considered more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred
	tax assets will not be realized.

	examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position. The Group recognizes interest and penalties, if any, related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense.

	options granted and the quoted market price of the Company&#146;s equity shares to measure the fair value of non-vested equity shares (&#147;NES&#148;) granted to employees at each measurement date. The binomial option pricing model is adopted

	In April 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (&#147;FASB&#148;) issued a new pronouncement which amends to change the criteria for
	reporting discontinued operations while enhancing disclosures in this area. It also addresses sources of confusion and inconsistent application related to financial reporting of discontinued operations guidance in U.S. GAAP. Under the new guidance,
	only disposals representing a strategic shift in operations should be presented as discontinued operations. Those strategic shifts should have a major effect on the organization&#146;s operations and financial results. Examples include a disposal of
	a major geographic area, a major line of business, or a major equity method investment. In addition, the new guidance requires expanded disclosures about discontinued operations that will provide financial statement users with more information about
	the assets, liabilities, income, and expenses of discontinued operations. The new guidance also requires disclosure of the pre-tax income attributable to a disposal of a significant part of an organization that does not qualify for discontinued
	operations reporting. This disclosure will provide users with information about the ongoing trends in a reporting organization&#146;s results from continuing operations. The amendments are effective for public business entities for fiscal years, and
	for interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December&nbsp;15, 2014. Early adoption is permitted. The Group adopted this ASU on June&nbsp;1, 2015 and the effects of the pronouncement have been reflected in the consolidated
	financial statements.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; MARGIN-LEFT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	In November, 2015, the FASB issued a new pronouncement which changes how deferred taxes are classified on
	organizations&#146; balance sheets. The ASU eliminates the current requirement for organizations to present deferred tax liabilities and assets as current and noncurrent in a classified balance sheet. Instead, organizations will be required to
	classify all deferred tax assets and liabilities as noncurrent. The amendments apply to all organizations that present a classified balance sheet. For public companies, the amendments are effective for financial statements issued for annual periods
	beginning after December&nbsp;15, 2016, and interim periods within those annual periods. Earlier application is permitted for all entities as of the beginning of an interim or annual reporting period. This ASU may be applied prospectively to all
	deferred tax liabilities and assets or retrospectively to all periods presented. The Group elected to early adopt this new guidance on a prospective basis and have applied the changes to all deferred tax liabilities and assets and to the
	consolidated balance sheet as of May&nbsp;31, 2016. The Group did not retrospectively apply the changes to prior periods.

	In May 2014, FASB issued a new pronouncement which affects any entity using U.S. GAAP
	that either enters into contracts with customers to transfer goods or services or enters into contracts for the transfer of nonfinancial assets unless those contracts are within the scope of other standards (e.g., insurance contracts or lease
	contracts). This ASU will supersede the revenue recognition requirements in Topic 605, Revenue Recognition, and most industry-specific guidance. This ASU also supersedes some cost guidance included in Subtopic 605-35, Revenue
	Recognition&#151;Construction-Type and Production-Type Contracts. In addition, the existing requirements for the recognition of a gain or loss on the transfer of nonfinancial assets that are not in a contract with a customer (e.g., assets within the
	scope of Topic 360, Property, Plant, and Equipment, and intangible assets within the scope of Topic 350, Intangibles&#151;Goodwill and Other) are amended to be consistent with the guidance on recognition and measurement (including the constraint on
	revenue) in this ASU.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; MARGIN-LEFT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The core principle of the guidance is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised
	goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. To achieve that core principle, an entity should apply the following steps:

	In June 2014, the FASB issued a new pronouncement
	which requires that a performance target that affects vesting and that could be achieved after the requisite service period be treated as a performance condition. A reporting entity should apply existing guidance in Topic 718,
	Compensation&#151;Stock Compensation, as it relates to awards with performance conditions that affect vesting to account for such awards. The performance target should not be reflected in estimating the grant-date fair value of the award.
	Compensation cost should be recognized in the period in which it becomes probable that the performance target will be achieved and should represent the compensation cost attributable to the period(s) for which the requisite service has already been
	rendered. If the performance target becomes probable of being achieved before the end of the requisite service period, the remaining unrecognized compensation cost should be recognized prospectively over the remaining requisite service period. The
	total amount of compensation cost recognized during and after the requisite service period should reflect the number of awards that are expected to vest and should be adjusted to reflect those awards that ultimately vest. The requisite service
	period ends when the employee can cease rendering service and still be eligible to vest in the award if the performance target is achieved. The amendments in this ASU are effective for annual periods and interim periods within those annual periods
	beginning after December&nbsp;15, 2015. Earlier adoption is permitted. Entities may apply the amendments in this ASU either: (a)&nbsp;prospectively to all awards granted or modified after the effective date; or (b)&nbsp;retrospectively to all awards
	with performance targets that are outstanding as of the beginning of the earliest annual period presented in the financial statements and to all new or modified awards thereafter. If retrospective transition is adopted, the cumulative effect of
	applying this ASU as of the beginning of the earliest annual period presented in the financial statements should be recognized as an adjustment to the opening retained earnings balance at that date. In addition, if retrospective transition is
	adopted, an entity may use hindsight in measuring and recognizing the compensation cost. The Group does not expect the adoption of this pronouncement will have a significant effect on its consolidated financial position or results of operations.

	transactions). The ASU focuses on the consolidation evaluation for reporting organizations (public and private companies and not-for-profit organizations) that are required to evaluate whether they should consolidate certain legal entities. In
	addition to reducing the number of consolidation models from four to two, the new standard simplifies the FASB Accounting Standards Codification (&#147;Codification&#148;) and improves current GAAP by:

	In September 2015, the FASB issued a new pronouncement ASU 2015-16, Business Combinations (Topic 805): Simplifying the Accounting for
	Measurement-Period Adjustments. To simplify the accounting for adjustments made to provisional amounts recognized in a business combination, the amendments eliminate the requirement to retrospectively account for those adjustments. Under this ASU,
	an acquirer must recognize adjustments to provisional amounts that are identified during the measurement period in the reporting period in which the adjustment amounts are determined. The ASU also requires acquirers to present separately on the face
	of the income statement, or disclose in the notes, the portion of the amount recorded in current-period earnings by line item that would have been recorded in previous reporting periods if the adjustment to the provisional amounts had been
	recognized as of the acquisition date. For public business entities, the ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December&nbsp;15, 2015, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The ASU must be applied prospectively to
	adjustments to provisional amounts that occur after the effective date. Early adoption is permitted for financial statements that have not been issued. The Company does not expect the adoption of this guidance will have a significant effect on its

	In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842). The guidance supersedes existing

	payments. For operating leases with a term of 12 months or less, a lessee is permitted to make an accounting policy election not to recognize lease assets and liabilities. For public business entities, the guidance is effective for fiscal years
	beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early application of the guidance is permitted. In transition, entities are required to recognize and measure leases at the beginning of the earliest period

	In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-07, simplifying the Transition to the Equity
	Method of Accounting. The amendments eliminate the requirement that when an investment qualified for use of the equity method as a result of an increase in the level of ownership interest or degree of influence, an investor must adjust the
	investment, results of operations, and retained earnings retroactively on a step-by-step basis as if the equity method had been in effect during all previous periods that the investment had been held. The amendments require that the equity method
	investor add the cost of acquiring the additional interest in the investee to the current basis of the investor&#146;s previous held interest and adopt the equity method of accounting as of the date the investment becomes qualified for equity method
	accounting. Therefore, upon qualifying for the equity method of accounting, no retroactive adjustment of the investment is required. The amendments require that an entity that has an available-for-sale equity security that becomes qualified for the
	equity method of accounting recognize through earnings the unrealized holding gain or loss in accumulated other comprehensive income at the date the investment becomes qualified for use of the equity method. The amendments are effective for all
	entities for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2016. The amendments should be applied prospectively upon their effective date to increase in the level of ownership interest or degree of
	influence that result in the adoption of the equity method. Earlier application is permitted. The Group is in the process of evaluating the impact that this pronouncements on its consolidated financial statements.

	The amendments
	in this update do not change the core principle of the guidance in Topic 606. Rather, the amendments clarify certain aspects related to identifying the performance obligation in the contract and the licensing implementation guidance while retaining
	the related principles. The Group is in the process of evaluating the impact of adoption of this ASU on its consolidated financial statements.

	In May, 2016, the FASB issued a new pronouncement ASU 2016-12 which provides clarifying
	guidance in certain narrow areas and add some practical expedients as discussed below. The amendments clarify the objective of the collectability criterion in Step 1. The objective of this assessment is to determine whether the contract is valid and
	represents a substantive transaction on the basis of whether a customer has the ability and intention to pay the promised consideration in exchange for the goods or services that will be transferred to the customer. The amendments also add a new
	criterion to paragraph 606-10-25-7 to clarify when revenue would be recognized for a contract that fails to meet the criteria in Step 1. That criterion allows an entity to recognize revenue in the amount of consideration received when the entity has
	transferred control of the goods or services, the entity has stopped transferring goods or services (if applicable) and has no obligation under the contract to transfer additional goods or services, and the consideration received from the customer
	is nonrefundable. The amendments permit an entity, as an accounting policy election, to exclude amounts collected from customers for all sales (and other similar) taxes from the transaction price. The amendments specify that the measurement date for
	noncash consideration is contract inception. The amendments also clarify that the variable consideration guidance applies only to variability resulting from reasons other than the form of the consideration. The amendments provide a practical
	expedient that permits an entity to reflect the aggregate effect of all modifications that occur before the beginning of the earliest period presented when identifying the satisfied and unsatisfied performance obligations, determining the
	transaction price, and allocating the transaction price to the satisfied and unsatisfied performance obligations. The amendments clarify that a completed contract for purposes of transition is a contract for which all (or substantially all) of the
	revenue was recognized under legacy GAAP before the date of initial application. Accounting for elements of a contract that do not affect revenue under legacy GAAP are irrelevant to the assessment of whether a contract is complete. In addition, the
	amendments permit an entity to apply the modified retrospective transition method either to all contracts or only to contracts that are not completed contracts. The amendments clarify that an entity that retrospectively applies the guidance in Topic
	606 to each prior reporting period is not required to disclose the effect of the accounting change for the period of adoption. However, an entity is still required to disclose the effect of the changes on any prior periods retrospectively adjusted.
	The effective date and transition of these amendments is the same as the effective date and transition of ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606). The Group is in the process of evaluating the impact of adoption of this
	pronouncements on its consolidated financial statements.

	In August 2016, the FASB issued new pronouncements ASU 2016-15, Statement of Cash
	Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments. The amendments in this Update provide guidance on the following specific cash flow issues such as: (1)&nbsp;Contingent Consideration Payments Made after a Business
	Combination; (2)&nbsp;Distributions Received from Equity Method Investees. The amendments in this Update are effective for public business entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those fiscal years.
	Early adoption is permitted, including adoption in an interim period. An entity that elects early adoption must adopt all of the amendments in the same period. The Group does not expect the adoption of this pronouncement will have a significant
	effect on its consolidated financial position or results of operations.

	In September 2011, the Group signed a share subscription agreement to invest US$2,000 for 5% equity ownership interest in Dajie.com. The fair value of Dajie.com&#146;s equity ownership interest was not readily
	determinable and the Group did not have the ability to exercise significant influence over the operating and financial policies of Dajie.com. Accordingly, the investment in Dajie.com was accounted for as a cost-method investment. In March 2016, the

	On January&nbsp;20, 2006, the Company adopted 2006 Share Incentive Plan (&#147;2006 Share Incentive Plan&#148;), under which the Company may
	grant share options to purchase up to 8,000,000 common shares of the Group, to its employees, directors and consultants. The number of common shares available for grant under the 2006 Share Incentive Plan may be increased annually by (i)&nbsp;an
	additional 5,000,000 shares on January&nbsp;1, 2007, (ii)&nbsp;an additional 5,000,000 shares on January&nbsp;1, 2008, and (iii)&nbsp;an annual increase in common shares to be added on the first business day of each calendar year beginning in 2009
	equal to the lesser of (x)&nbsp;3,000,000 shares, (y)&nbsp;two percent (2%)&nbsp;of total common shares outstanding as of such date, or (z)&nbsp;a lesser number of shares as determined by the Group&#146;s management. In the event the aggregate
	number of shares that may be issued in any given year under all share compensation plans has reached the maximum number of shares allowed in that year, the Company may grant additional awards up to 2,000,000 shares, or extra shares. The number of

	The exercise price of share options is at least 100% of the fair value of the common shares on the date of the
	grant. The term of a share option is up to ten years from the date of grant. During the year ended May 31, 2016, the Group extended the terms of share options granted on February&nbsp;28, 2006 for another three years. The extension did not have a
	material impact on the Group&#146;s consolidated financial statements. The share options generally vest over three years at six-month vesting increments per year.

	Under the New Income Tax Law effective from January&nbsp;1, 2008, the rules for determining whether an entity is resident in the PRC for tax
	purposes have changed and the determination of residence depends among other things on the &#147;place of actual management&#148;. If the Group, or its non-PRC subsidiaries, were to be determined as a PRC resident for tax purposes, they would be
	subject to a 25% income tax rate on their worldwide income including the income arising in jurisdictions outside the PRC. The Group does not believe that its legal entities organized outside of the PRC are considered PRC residents.

	If the Company were to be a non-resident for PRC tax purposes, dividends paid to it out of profits earned after January&nbsp;1, 2008 would be
	subject to a withholding tax. In the case of dividends paid by PRC schools and subsidiaries to their foreign investors, the withholding tax would be 10%, unless any such foreign investor&#146;s jurisdiction of incorporation has a tax treaty with
	China that provides for a different withholding arrangement. During the year ended May&nbsp;31, 2015, Shanghai Smart Words paid US$5,559 withholding tax when it paid a special dividend to Smart Shine. During the year ended May&nbsp;31, 2016, Beijing
	Hewstone, Shanghai Smart Words and Beijing Decision paid US$7,590 withholding tax when they paid a special dividend to their parent companies, Elite Concept.

	Aggregate undistributed earnings of the Company&#146;s PRC subsidiaries and VIEs that are available for distribution was US$789,338 and
	US$1,133,217 as of May&nbsp;31, 2015 and May&nbsp;31, 2016, respectively. Upon distribution of such earnings, the Company will be subject to PRC EIT taxes, the amount of which is impractical to estimate. The Company did not record any tax on any of
	the aforementioned undistributed earnings because the relevant subsidiaries and VIEs do not intend to declare dividends and the Company intends to permanently reinvest it within the PRC. Additionally, no deferred tax liability was recorded for
	taxable temporary differences attributable to the undistributed earnings because the Company believes the undistributed earnings can be distributed in a manner that would not be subject to income tax.

	The Group did not identify any significant unrecognized tax benefits for the years ended May&nbsp;31, 2014, 2015 and 2016, respectively. The
	Group did not incur any significant interest and penalties related to potential underpaid income tax expenses and also does not anticipate any significant increases or decreases in unrecognized tax benefits in the next twelve months. The Group has
	no material unrecognized tax benefits which would favorably affect the effective income tax rate in future periods.

	According to the PRC
	Tax Administration and Collection Law, the tax authority may require the taxpayer or the withholding agent to make delinquent tax payment within three years if the underpayment of taxes is resulted from the tax authority&#146;s act or error. No late
	payment surcharge will be assessed under such circumstances. The statute of limitation will be three years if the underpayment of taxes is due to the computational errors made by the taxpayer or the withholding agent. Late payment surcharge will be
	assessed in such case. The statute of limitation will be extended to five years under special circumstances which are not clearly defined (but an underpayment of tax liability exceeding US$16 (RMB0.1 million) is specifically listed as a
	&#147;special circumstance&#148;). The statute of limitation for transfer pricing related issue is ten years. There is no statute of limitation in the case of tax evasion. Therefore, the Group&#146;s PRC domiciled entities are subject to examination
	by the PRC tax authorities based on the above.

	In February 2015, Koolearn Corporation issued 5,000,000 ordinary shares to certain employees and received the cash consideration of US$3,752. As the Company still retained a controlling interest in Koolearn Corporation,
	the disposal was accounted as an equity transaction in the Company&#146;s consolidated financial statements and the Company recognized a noncontrolling interest representing the 5.9% equity interest over Koolearn Corporation as of May&nbsp;31, 2015.
	In September 2015, the Group repurchased all these shares from the employees at the original purchase price per share. As the Group retained control over Koolearn before and after the repurchase of the 5.9% interest, the acquisition of this
	additional equity interest was accounted as an equity transaction in the Company&#146;s consolidated financial statements.
