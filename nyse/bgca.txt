	Our History

</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:8%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The voice brokerage business within our Financial Services segment originates from one of the oldest and most established inter-dealer
	franchises in the financial intermediary industry. Cantor started our wholesale intermediary brokerage operations in 1972. In 1996, Cantor launched its eSpeed system, which revolutionized the way government bonds are traded in the inter-dealer
	market by providing a fully electronic trading marketplace. eSpeed, Inc. (&#147;eSpeed&#148;) completed an initial public offering in 1999 and began trading on NASDAQ, yet it remained one of Cantor&#146;s controlled subsidiaries. Following
	eSpeed&#146;s initial public offering, Cantor continued to operate its inter-dealer voice brokerage business separately from eSpeed. In August 2004, Cantor announced the reorganization and separation of its inter-dealer voice brokerage business into
	a subsidiary called &#147;BGC,&#148; in honor of B. Gerald Cantor, the pioneer in screen brokerage services and fixed income market data products. In April 2008, BGC and certain other Cantor assets merged with and into eSpeed, and the combined
	company began operating under the name &#147;BGC Partners, Inc.&#148; In June 2013, BGC sold certain assets relating to its U.S. Treasury benchmark business and the name &#147;eSpeed&#148; to NASDAQ, Inc. (&#147;NASDAQ,&#148; formerly The NASDAQ OMX
	Group, Inc.) (see &#147;NASDAQ Transaction&#148;).
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:8%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Prior to the events of September11, 2001, our financial brokerage business was widely
	recognized as one of the leading full-service wholesale inter-dealer brokers in the world, with a rich history of developing innovative technological and financial solutions. After September&nbsp;11, 2001 and the loss of the majority of our
	U.S.-based employees, our voice financial brokerage business operated primarily in Europe.

	Since the formation of BGC in 2004, we have
	substantially rebuilt our U.S. presence and have continued to expand our global footprint through the acquisition and integration of established brokerage companies and the hiring of experienced brokers. Through these actions, we have been able to

	On February&nbsp;26, 2015, we successfully completed our tender offer to acquire shares of common stock, par value $0.01
	per share, of GFI for $6.10 per share in cash and accepted for purchase 54.3&nbsp;million shares tendered to us pursuant to the offer. The Tendered Shares, together with the 17.1&nbsp;million Shares already owned by us, represented approximately 56%
	of the then outstanding shares of GFI. We issued payment for the Tendered Shares on March&nbsp;4, 2015 in the aggregate amount of $331.1 million.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:8%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	In connection with the tender offer, on February&nbsp;19, 2015, we and one of our subsidiaries entered into a Tender Offer Agreement with GFI
	(the &#147;TO Agreement&#148;). Pursuant to the TO Agreement, the board of directors of GFI unanimously agreed to support our tender offer and to expand GFI&#146;s board and our designation of certain members. The TO Agreement also contained
	provisions with respect to the terms and timing of the back-end mergers of Jersey Partners Inc. (&#147;JPI&#148;), a stockholder of GFI, and with us.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:8%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Pursuant to the TO Agreement, GFI&#146;s then Executive Chairman, Michael Gooch, and its then Chief Executive Officer, Colin Heffron, remained
	as directors of GFI. Mr.&nbsp;Heffron entered into an amended and restated GFI employment agreement that continues to provide him with certain annual cash and equity compensation and severance arrangements. Mr.&nbsp;Gooch entered into a fixed-term
	employment agreement that provides him with certain cash and equity compensation. Pursuant to the TO Agreement, BGC has established a Distributable Earnings Bonus Pool (the &#147;Pool&#148;) program in an amount equal to one times the average annual
	distributable earnings (as defined) of the GFI inter-dealer brokerage business for the three successive 12-month periods beginning on July&nbsp;1, 2015. The Pool is in the form of awards of restricted equity units and preferred restricted equity
	units of BGC Holdings, L.P and will be allocated 35% to Mr.&nbsp;Gooch, 35% to Mr.&nbsp;Heffron and 30% to other GFI employees as mutually agreed by Messrs. Gooch and Heffron and BGC. As a condition to participation in the Pool, each participant
	(including Messrs. Gooch and Heffron) has entered into a non-competition and award agreement containing the terms and conditions of his or her participation, which terms include the participant&#146;s continued employment through July&nbsp;1, 2018

	Following the issuance of such new shares, we owned approximately 67% of GFI&#146;s then-outstanding common stock.

	On August&nbsp;24,
	2015, GFI, Messrs. Gooch and Heffron; JPI; CME Group, Inc. (&#147;CME&#148;), the former members of the GFI Special Committee, BGC; and certain other former officers and affiliates of GFI entered into a memorandum of understanding (the
	&#147;MOU&#148;) with regard to a preliminary settlement (the &#147;Settlement&#148;) of the consolidated class action case pending against GFI in the State of Delaware (the &#147;Consolidated Delaware Action&#148;). Neither GFI nor BGC contributed
	any funds to the Settlement, which will be paid from a combination of insurance proceeds and payments by JPI and Messrs. Gooch and Heffron. The Settlement provides for a settlement fund of $10.75 million for the class of GFI stockholders in the
	Consolidated Delaware Action and payment of attorneys&#146; fees and costs to plaintiffs&#146; counsel in an amount to be established by negotiation, mediation or a fee application to the Court. The final Settlement will also require approval of the
	Court. In connection with the Settlement, on October&nbsp;6, 2015, we advanced $10.75 million to JPI in return for a promissory note (the &#147;JPI Note&#148;). The JPI Note bore interest at the rate of 5.375%&nbsp;per annum and was secured by
	two&nbsp;million shares of GFI common stock owned by JPI. The JPI Note was repaid on the date of the Back-End Mergers. In the MOU, the CME agreed to terminate the restriction prohibiting former executive officers of GFI, JPI and certain other
	stockholders and affiliates of GFI from supporting the Back-End Mergers. In connection with the Settlement, Messrs. Gooch and Heffron, JPI, BGC and GFI entered into a separate agreement providing for certain matters relating to the merger of BGC and
	GFI and allocating certain responsibilities and advancing certain payments (the &#147;Settlement Letter&#148;).The Settlement Letter also included the following agreements: (i)&nbsp;payment of the plaintiffs&#146; attorneys&#146; fees and costs in
	the Consolidated Delaware Action first from insurance proceeds, with any excess to be paid by Messrs. Gooch and Heffron; (ii)&nbsp;indemnification by Messrs. Gooch and Heffron with respect to liabilities and expenses in the Consolidated Delaware
	Action and other cases related to breach of fiduciary duty or other causes of action, the CME Merger Agreement, insurance claims and the tender offer to the extent not covered by insurance; and (iii)&nbsp;indemnification by Mr.&nbsp;Gooch with
	respect to liabilities and expenses in connection with the remaining New York class action case that are not otherwise covered by insurance.

	in consolidation. This figure excludes the $29.0 million gain recorded in the first quarter of 2015 with respect to the appreciation of the 17.1&nbsp;million shares of GFI held by BGC prior to the successful completion of the tender offer. Including
	this gain, the calculation of purchase consideration and noncontrolling interest totaled $779.5 million.

	expenses, and the 14,883,705 shares of NASDAQ common stock will be paid ratably in each of the fifteen years following the closing in which the consolidated gross revenue of NASDAQ, as a whole, is equal to or greater than $25 million. On each of

	CreditMatch. These electronic marketplaces include government bond markets, interest rate derivatives, spot foreign exchange, foreign exchange derivatives, corporate bonds, and credit derivatives. We believe that we offer a comprehensive application

	Through our subsidiaries, we execute matched principal transactions in which we act as a &#147;middleman&#148; by serving as counterparty to
	both a buyer and a seller in matching back-to-back trades. These transactions are then settled through a recognized settlement system or third-party clearing organization. Settlement typically occurs within one to three business days after the trade
	date. Cash settlement of the transaction occurs upon receipt or delivery of the underlying instrument that was traded. We generally avoid settlement of principal transactions on a free-of-payment basis or by physical delivery of the underlying
	instrument. However, free-of-payment transactions may occur on a very limited basis.

</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:8%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Market risk refers to the risk that a change in the level of one or more market prices, rates, indices or other factors will result in losses
	for a specified position. In our Financial Services business, we may allow certain of our desks to enter into unmatched principal transactions in the ordinary course of business and hold long and short inventory positions. These transactions are
	primarily for the purpose of managing proprietary positions, facilitating clients&#146; execution needs, adding liquidity to a market or attracting additional order flow. As a result, we may have market risk exposure on these transactions. Our
	exposure varies based on the size of our overall positions, the risk characteristics of the instruments held and the amount of time the positions are held before they are disposed of. We have limited ability to track our exposure to market risk and
	unmatched positions on an intra-day basis; however, we attempt to mitigate market risk on these positions by strict risk limits, extremely limited holding periods and hedging our exposure. These positions are intended to be held short term to
	facilitate customer transactions. However, due to a number of factors, including the nature of the position and access to the market on which it trades, we may not be able to unwind the position and we may be forced to hold the position for a longer
	period than anticipated. All positions held longer than intra-day are marked to market.

	We also have investments in marketable equity
	securities, which are publicly traded, and which had a fair value of $650.4 million as of December&nbsp;31, 2015. These include the shares of common stock of NASDAQ that we received in exchange for a portion of our electronic benchmark Treasury
	platform and the shares of the common stock of ICE that we received in exchange for Trayport. Investments in marketable securities carry a degree of risk, as there can be no assurance that the marketable securities will not lose value and, in
	general, securities markets can be volatile and unpredictable. As a result of these different market risks, our holdings of marketable securities could be materially and adversely affected. We seek to minimize the effect of price changes on a
	portion of our investments in marketable securities through the use of derivative contracts. However, there can be no assurance that our hedging activities will be adequate to protect us against price risks associated with our investments in
	marketable securities. See Note 10&#151;&#147;Marketable Securities&#148; and Note 12&#151;&#147;Derivatives&#148; to our consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item&nbsp;8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information regarding

	Our risk management procedures and strict limits are designed to monitor and limit the

	downturn or disruption in the markets for these positions could result in a substantial loss. In addition, principal gains and losses resulting from these positions could on occasion have a disproportionate effect, positive or negative, on our
	consolidated financial condition and results of operations for any particular reporting period.

	Although our businesses will often use exchanges to execute transactions brokered in both listed and OTC markets, we believe that exchanges
	have sought and will seek to migrate products traditionally traded in OTC markets by inter-dealer and/or wholesale financial brokers to exchanges. However, we believe that when a product goes from OTC to exchange-traded, the underlying or related
	OTC market often continues to experience growth in line with the growth of the exchange-traded contract. In addition, ICE operates both regulated exchanges and OTC execution services, and in the latter it competes directly with inter-dealer and/or
	wholesale financial brokers in energy, commodities, and credit products. ICE entered these OTC markets primarily by acquiring independent OTC brokers, and we believe that it is likely ICE or other exchange operators may seek to compete with us in
	the future by acquiring other such brokers, by creating futures products designed to mimic OTC products, or through other means. Further, ICE also operates a swap execution facility (&#147;SEF&#148;), as does Tradeweb Markets LLC

	Banks and broker-dealers have in the past created and/or funded consortia to compete with exchanges and inter-dealer brokers.&nbsp;For example,
	ICAP plc&#146;s inter-dealer businesses for fully electronic trading of U.S. Treasuries and spot foreign exchange both began as dealer-owned consortia before being acquired by ICAP plc.&nbsp;An example of a current and similar consortium is
	Tradeweb.&nbsp;Currently, several large banks hold stakes in Tradeweb, an Internet-based market intermediary.&nbsp;Thomson Reuters Corporation is Tradeweb&#146;s single largest shareholder. Although Tradeweb operates primarily as a dealer to
	customer platform, some of its offerings include a voice and electronic inter-dealer platform and a SEF. In addition, Tradeweb&#146;s management has said that it would like to expand into other inter-dealer markets, and as such may compete with us

	In addition, certain investment management firms that traditionally deal with banks and broker-dealers have
	expressed a desire to have direct access to certain parts of the wholesale financial markets via firms such as ours. We believe that over time, interdealer-brokers will therefore gain a small percentage of the sales and trading market currently
	dominated by banks and broker-dealers. Since their collective revenues are many times those of the global inter-dealer market, we believe that our gaining a small share of banks and broker-dealers&#146; revenues would lead to a meaningful increase

	We believe that our partnership structure is one of the unique strengths of our business. Many of our key brokers,
	salespeople and other front office professionals have their own capital invested in our business, aligning their interests with our stockholders. Limited partnership interests in BGC Holdings consist of: (i)&nbsp;&#147;founding/working partner
	units&#148; held by limited partners who are employees; (ii)&nbsp;&#147;limited partnership units,&#148; which consist of a variety of units that are generally held by employees such as REUs, RPUs, PSUs, PSIs, PSEs, LPUs, APSUs, APSIs, APSEs, AREUs,

	designee, NPSUs are expected to be converted into the underlying unit type and will then participate in Partnership distributions, subject to terms and conditions determined by the General Partner of the Partnership in its sole discretion, including
	that the recipient continue to provide substantial services to the Company and comply with his or her partnership obligations. In addition, we have NREUs, NPREUs, NLPUs, NPLPUs and NPPSUs (collectively, the &#147;N Units&#148;) which are
	non-distributing partnership units that may not be allocated any item of profit or loss and may not be made exchangeable into shares of our Class&nbsp;A common stock. Subject to the approval of the Compensation Committee or its designee, the N Units

	We believe that our partnership structure is an effective tool in recruiting, motivating and retaining key employees. Many brokers are
	attracted by the opportunity to become partners because the partnership agreement generally entitles partners to quarterly distributions of income from the partnership. While BGC Holdings limited partnership interests generally entitle our partners
	to participate in distributions of income from the operations of our business, upon leaving BGC Holdings (or upon any other redemption or purchase of such limited partnership interests as described below), any such partners are only entitled to
	receive over time, and provided he or she does not violate certain partner obligations, an amount for his or her BGC Holdings limited partnership interests that reflects such partner&#146;s capital account or compensatory grant awards, excluding any
	goodwill or going concern value of our business unless Cantor, in the case of the founding partners, and we, as the general partner of BGC Holdings, otherwise determine. Our partners can receive the right to exchange their BGC Holdings limited
	partnership interests for shares of our Class&nbsp;A common stock (if, in the case of founding partners, Cantor so determines and, in the case of working partners and limited partnership unit holders, the BGC Holdings general partner, with
	Cantor&#146;s consent, determines otherwise) and thereby realize any higher value associated with our Class&nbsp;A common stock. We believe that, having invested in us, partners feel a sense of responsibility for the health and performance of our
	business and have a strong incentive to maximize our revenues and profitability.

	The SEC is the federal agency primarily responsible for the administration of federal securities
	laws, including adopting rules and regulations applicable to broker-dealers (other than government securities broker-dealers) and enforcing both its rules regarding broker-dealers and the Treasury&#146;s rules regarding government securities
	broker-dealers. In addition, we operate a number of platforms that are governed pursuant to SEC Regulation ATS. Broker-dealers are also subject to regulation by state securities administrators in those states in which they conduct business or have
	registered to do business. In addition, Treasury rules relating to trading government securities apply to such activities when engaged in by broker-dealers. The Commodities Futures Trading Commission (the &#147;CFTC&#148;) is the federal agency
	primarily responsible for the administration of federal commodities future laws and other acts, including the adoption of rules applicable to Futures Commissions Merchants, Designated Contract Markets (&#147;DCM&#148;) such as ELX, and Swap

	Much of the regulation of
	broker-dealers&#146; operations in the United States has been delegated to self-regulatory organizations. These self-regulatory organizations adopt rules (which are subject to approval by the SEC) that govern the operations of broker-dealers and
	government securities broker-dealers and conduct periodic inspections and examinations of their operations. In the case of our U.S. broker-dealer subsidiaries, the principal self-regulatory organization is FINRA. FINRA was formed from the
	consolidation of the NASD&#146;s member regulation operations and the regulatory arm of the NYSE Group to act as the self-regulatory organization for all broker-dealers doing business within the United States. Accordingly, our U.S. subsidiaries are
	subject to both scheduled and unscheduled examinations by the SEC and FINRA. In our futures-related activities, our subsidiaries are also subject to the rules of the CFTC, futures exchanges of which they are members and the National Futures
	Association (&#147;NFA&#148;), a futures self-regulatory organization.

	In light of recent events in the U.S. and global financial markets, regulators and legislators in the U.S. and
	European Union (&#147;EU&#148;) continue to craft new laws and regulations for the global OTC derivatives markets, including the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the &#147;Dodd-Frank Act&#148;), which became law in July
	2010. The Dodd-Frank Act mandates or encourages several reforms regarding derivatives, including new regulations for swaps markets creating impartiality considerations, additional pre- and post-trade transparency requirements, and heightened
	collateral or capital standards, as well as recommendations for the obligatory use of central clearing for most standardized derivatives. The law also requires that standardized OTC derivatives be traded in an open and non-exclusionary manner on a
	DCM or a SEF. The SEC is still in the process of finalizing rules for the implementation of these requirements and it is anticipated that the SEC will release their rule set surrounding SEFs in the first half of 2016. The actual implementation of
	such rules may be phased in over a longer period.

	Similarly, while the recently adopted Volcker Rule will not apply directly to us, the
	Volcker Rule may have a material impact on many of the banking and other institutions with which we do business or compete. There may be continued uncertainty regarding the Volcker Rule, its impact on various affected businesses, how those

	BGC Derivative Markets, L.P.
	(&#147;BGC Derivative Markets&#148;), and GFI Swaps Exchange LLC, our subsidiaries, began operating as SEFs on October&nbsp;2, 2013. Both BGC Derivative Markets and GFI Swaps Exchange received permanent registration approval from the CFTC as SEFs on
	January&nbsp;22, 2016. Mandatory Dodd-Frank Act compliant execution on SEFs by eligible U.S. persons commenced in February 2014 for &#147;made available to trade&#148; products, and a wide range of other rules relating to the execution and clearing
	of derivative products have been finalized with implementation periods in 2016 and beyond. BGC also maintains its ownership stake in ELX, a CFTC-approved DCM. We believe that our relative competitive position is strong in this new environment, and
	that we will gain market share in the U.S. This is because the new rules not only require OTC market execution venues to maintain robust front-end and back-office IT capabilities and to make large and ongoing technology investments, but also because
	recent revisions to the execution methodology rules will allow elements of voice brokerage to flourish. We are a leader in both the breadth and scale of our hybrid and fully electronic trading capability, and we expect to outperform our competitors

	The Financial Conduct Authority (&#147;FCA&#148;) is the relevant statutory regulator for the United Kingdom financial services industry. The
	FCA was established in 2013, and superseded the former regulatory agency, the Financial Services Authority (&#147;FSA&#148;). The FCA&#146;s objectives are to protect customers, maintain the stability of the financial services industry and promote
	competition between financial services providers. It has broad rule-making, investigative and enforcement powers derived from the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 and subsequent and derivative legislation and regulations.

	The FCA has continued to implement the far-reaching reform rules initiated by the FSA, that are designed to enhance firms&#146; liquidity risk
	management practices, based on the lessons learned since the start of the credit crisis in 2007, as well as a regulatory model with a clear internal separation of conduct of business and prudential regulation. Implications of these rules include
	better liquidity risk management capability (including the use of stress testing and contingency funding plans (&#147;CFP&#148;), less reliance on short-term wholesale funding, and a heightened reliance on higher amounts and quality of liquid asset
	securities (such as government securities), leading to an increased likelihood of surviving a severe liquidity stress event with the overarching principles being self-sufficiency and adequacy of liquid resources. Currently, we have subsidiaries and
	branches regulated by the FCA (BGC Brokers L.P., the U.K. branch of Aurel BGC, GFI Securities Ltd. and GFI Brokers Limited).

	10% without first informing and seeking the approval of the FCA in breach of certain U.K. controller requirements. This was a breach of U.K. regulatory law. The FCA had taken the view that it was not appropriate in this specific case for it to take
	any formal action. On November&nbsp;19, 2014, we also announced that we had received approval from the FCA to acquire control of GFI and thereby take control of the U.K. regulated firms within GFI. We have also received similar approvals in Hong
	Kong and Singapore. Additional approvals were granted in connection with the Back-End Mergers in December 2015. See &#147;Acquisition of GFI Group Inc.&#148;

	Increasingly, the FCA has developed a practice of requiring senior officers of regulated firms to provide individual attestations or
	undertakings as to the status of the firm&#146;s control environment, compliance with specific rules and regulations, or the completion of required tasks. Officers of BGC Brokers L.P. and GFI Brokers Limited have given such attestations or
	undertakings in the past and may do so again in the future. Similarly, the FCA can seek a voluntary requirement notice (&#147;VREQ&#148;), which is a voluntary undertaking on behalf of a firm that is made publicly available on the FCA&#146;s
	website. In 2014, the FCA issued industry-wide interpretive guidance on the management of potential conflicts pursuant to the VREQ process.

	The European Market Infrastructure Regulation on OTC derivatives, central counterparties and
	trade repositories (&#147;EMIR&#148;) was adopted in July 2012. EMIR fulfills several of the EU&#146;s G20 commitments to reform OTC derivatives markets. The reforms are designed to reduce systemic risk and bring more transparency to both OTC and
	listed derivatives markets. EMIR derivatives rules will apply initially to financial and non-financial firms that are counterparties to derivatives contracts in the EU and later to those trading outside the EU under certain circumstances.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:8%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The first compliance obligations for EMIR came into force in mid-March 2013 with the adoption of certain regulatory technical standards and
	implementing technical standards which included timely confirmations. Risk mitigation techniques for uncleared OTC derivatives became effective September&nbsp;15, 2013 and comprised ISDA portfolio reconciliation, dispute resolution and disclosure
	protocol. The trade reporting for OTC derivative contracts to be reported to a Trade Repository (&#147;TR&#148;) came into effect in phases during February to August 2014. By February 2017, all OTC derivative contracts entered into before or after
	August&nbsp;16, 2012 and no longer outstanding as of February&nbsp;12, 2014 are to be reported to a TR. In October 2014, the European Commission adopted its first &#147;equivalence&#148; decisions for the regulatory regimes of central counterparties
	in Australia, Hong Kong, Japan and Singapore. The central counterparties in these third country jurisdictions will be able to obtain recognition in the EU and can therefore be used by market participants to clear standardized OTC derivatives as
	required by EU legislation, while remaining subject solely to the regulation and supervision of their home jurisdiction. In July 2013, the European Commission and the CFTC announced the &#147;Path Forward&#148; on the alignment of OTC derivatives
	regulations between the two jurisdictions. For the EU, this involves the implementation of EMIR and proposed amendments to the European Commission&#146;s Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (&#147;MiFID&#148;).

	We are unable to predict how any of these new laws and proposed rules and regulations will be implemented or in what form, or whether any

	fines, sanctions, enhanced oversight, increased financial and capital requirements and additional restrictions or limitations on our ability to conduct or grow our businesses, and could otherwise have an adverse effect on our businesses, financial
	condition, results of operations and prospects. We believe that uncertainty and potential delays around the final form of such new rules and regulations might take may negatively impact our customers and trading volumes in certain markets in which
	we transact. Increased capital requirements may also diminish transaction velocity. While the broad framework of proposed rules and regulations is known, we believe that it remains premature to know conclusively the specific aspects of the U.S. and
	E.U. proposals that may directly affect our businesses, as some proposals have not yet been finalized and others which have been proposed remain subject to supervisory debate. While we generally believe the net impact of the rules and regulations

	In the United States, net capital is essentially defined as net worth (assets minus liabilities), plus qualifying subordinated borrowings and
	less certain mandatory deductions that result from excluding assets that are not readily convertible into cash and from conservatively valuing certain other assets, such as a firm&#146;s positions in securities. Among these deductions are
	adjustments, commonly referred to as &#147;haircuts,&#148; to the market value of securities positions to reflect the market risk of such positions prior to their liquidation or disposition. The Uniform Net Capital Requirements also impose a minimum

	or advance against equity capital for the direct or indirect benefit of certain persons related to the broker-dealer (including partners and affiliates) if the broker-dealer&#146;s net capital is, or would be as a result of such withdrawal,
	distribution, reductions, loan or advance, below specified thresholds of excess net capital. In addition, the SEC&#146;s regulations require certain notifications to be provided in advance of such withdrawals, distributions, reductions, loans and
	advances that exceed, in the aggregate, 30% of excess net capital within any 30-day period. The SEC has the authority to restrict, for up to 20 business days, such withdrawal, distribution or reduction of capital if the SEC concludes that it may be
	detrimental to the financial integrity of the broker-dealer or may expose its customers or creditors to loss. Notice is required following any such withdrawal, distribution, reduction, loan or advance that exceeds, in the aggregate, 20% of excess

	On June 5, 2015, we entered into an agreement with Cantor providing Cantor, CFGM and other Cantor affiliates entitled to hold Class B common
	stock the right to exchange from time to time, on a one-to-one basis, subject to adjustment, up to an aggregate of 34,649,693 shares of Class A common stock now owned or subsequently acquired by such Cantor entities for up to an aggregate of
	34,649,693 shares of Class B common stock. These shares of Class B common stock represent the remaining 34,649,693 authorized but unissued shares of Class B common stock available under our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation. The
	exchange agreement will enable the Cantor entities to acquire the same number of shares of Class B common stock that they are already entitled to acquire without having to exchange their exchangeable limited partnership units in BGC Holdings. Our
	Audit Committee and full Board of Directors determined that it was in the best interests of us and our stockholders to approve the exchange agreement because it will help ensure that Cantor retains its exchangeable limited partnership units in BGC
	Holdings, which is the same partnership in which our partner employees participate, thus continuing to align the interests of Cantor with those of the partner employees. We and Cantor have agreed that any shares of Class B common stock issued in
	connection with the exchange agreement would be deducted from the aggregate number of shares of Class B common stock that may be issued to the Cantor entities upon exchange of exchangeable limited partnership units in BGC Holdings. Accordingly, the

	Units&#148;), which are Working Partner Units. These new N Units carry the same name as the underlying unit with the insertion of an additional &#147;N&#148; to designate them as the N Unit type and are designated as NREUs, NPREUs, NLPUs, NPLPUs and
	NPPSUs. The N Units are not entitled to participate in Partnership distributions, will not be allocated any items of profit or loss and may not be made exchangeable into shares of the Company&#146;s Class&nbsp;A common stock. Subject to the approval
	of the Compensation Committee or its designee, the N Units are expected to be converted into the underlying unit type (i.e. an NREU will be converted into an REU) and will then participate in Partnership distributions, subject to terms and

	Our acquisitions, such as that of GFI or other potential future acquisitions, may lead to a significant increase in the level of our
	indebtedness. On January&nbsp;12, 2016, we completed the merger with GFI by acquiring 100 percent of GFI&#146;s outstanding shares. In December 2014, we issued our 5.375% Senior Notes in anticipation of the tender offer which initiated such
	acquisition. As part of the GFI acquisition, we assumed $240.0 million in aggregate principal amount of GFI 8.375% Senior Notes due July 2018, and $60.0 million in short-term borrowings related to a GFI credit facility, which has since been repaid.
	In addition, on March&nbsp;13, 2015, we entered into a secured loan arrangement of $28.2 million under which we pledged certain fixed assets as security for a loan. This arrangement incurs interest at a fixed rate of 3.70% and matures on
	April&nbsp;1, 2019. Partially offsetting these increases to our indebtedness, on April&nbsp;13, 2015, our $150.0 million of 8.75% Convertible Senior Notes, due April&nbsp;15, 2015, were fully converted into approximately 24.0&nbsp;million shares of
	our Class&nbsp;A common stock, which were issued to Cantor. Further, in December 2015 we completed the sale of our Trayport business in exchange for 2,527,658 shares of Intercontinental Exchange, Inc. (&#147;ICE&#148;) common stock, of which
	2,030,203 shares have been sold as of February&nbsp;22, 2016. We may also enter into other short- or long-term financing arrangements in connection with similar acquisitions which may occur from time to time. In addition, in connection with the GFI
	acquisition, we incurred substantial non-recurring transaction costs, including break-up fees, assumption of liabilities and expenses, and compensation expenses and we would likely incur similar expenses in connection with other

	Protecting our intellectual property rights is costly and time consuming. Many companies, including those in the computer and financial

	proliferation of patents applicable to these industries and a substantial increase in the number of such patent applications filed. Under current law, U.S. patent applications typically remain secret for 18 months or, in some cases, until a patent
	is issued. Because of technological changes in these industries, current extensive patent coverage, and the rapid rate of issuance of new patents, it is possible certain components of our products and services may unknowingly infringe existing

	In recent years, policies undertaken by certain central banks, such as the U.S. Federal Reserve, the European Central Bank, and the Bank of
	England, have involved quantitative easing or the buying and selling of currencies in the foreign exchange market. Quantitative easing involves open market transactions by monetary authorities to stimulate economic activity through the purchase of
	assets of longer maturity and has the effect of lowering interest rates further out on the yield curve.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:8%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	For example, as of
	January&nbsp;1, 2016, the U.S. Federal Reserve held approximately $3.7 trillion worth of long-dated U.S. Treasury and Federal Agency securities which are not being traded or hedged. This compares to $1.7 trillion at the beginning of 2011 and zero
	prior to September 2008. This has reduced volatility and volumes for listed and OTC interest rate products in the U.S. Although the Federal Reserve has ceased purchases, it continues to hold substantially all of the securities purchased. In
	addition, despite the recent increase in interest rates, the Federal Reserve may continue to use traditional methods to keep short-term interest rates low by historical standards.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:8%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Recently, central banks in other jurisdictions, including the EU, Japan and China, have undertaken quantitative easing and other steps aimed
	at reducing interest rates and stimulating their economies through monetary policy. In these jurisdictions also, interest rates are expected to remain low by historical standards for some time to come.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:8%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Similarly, global FX volumes were muted over various periods during the past several years, largely because certain major central banks, such
	as those in Japan and China and, until recently, Switzerland, intervened to keep global currencies from appreciating, and because low interest rates (themselves partially a result of quantitative easing) in most major economies make carry-trade
	strategies less appealing for FX market participants. In addition, increased capital requirements for banks and other financial institutions are likely to result in increased holdings of government securities, which holdings will be less likely to
	be traded or hedged, thus reducing further transaction volumes in those securities. Since the new capital requirements make it more expensive for the banks and other financial institutions to hold assets other than government securities, the new
	requirements may also reduce their trading and hedging activities in corporate and asset-backed fixed income securities as well as in various other OTC cash and derivative instruments. Moreover, many of our large bank customers have faced increasing
	regulatory scrutiny of their rates and FX businesses, and this may negatively impact industry volumes. These central banking policies may materially adversely affect our businesses, particularly our rates and FX operations.

	significant capital requirements. In the U.S., the SEC, FINRA, the CFTC, the NFA and various other regulatory bodies have stringent provisions with respect to capital applicable to the operation of brokerage firms, which vary depending upon the
	nature and extent of these entities&#146; activities. Four of our subsidiaries, BGCF, GFI Securities LLC, Kyte Securities LLC and Mint are registered with the SEC and subject to the Uniform Net Capital Requirements. As Futures Commissions Merchants
	(&#147;FCMs&#148;), BGCF and Mint are also subject to CFTC capital requirements. BGCF is also a member of the FICC, which imposes capital requirements on its members. We also hold a 49% limited partnership interest in Aqua, a U.S. registered
	broker-dealer and ATS. These entities are subject to SEC, FINRA, CFTC and NFA net capital requirements. In addition, our SEFs, BGC Derivative Markets and GFI Swaps Exchange, are required to maintain financial resources to cover operating costs for
	at least one year, keeping at least enough cash or highly liquid securities to cover six months&#146; operating costs.

	requirements established by the FCA. The FCA applies stringent provisions with respect to capital applicable to the operation of these brokerage firms, which vary depending upon the nature and extent of their activities. The provisions relating to

	We expect to continue to maintain levels of capital in excess of regulatory

	of registration or withdrawal of authorization or other disciplinary action from domestic and international regulators, which would have a material adverse effect on us. In addition, should we fail to maintain the capital required by clearing

	In the U.K., the FCA has continued to
	implement far-reaching reform rules initiated by the FSA that are designed to enhance firms&#146; liquidity risk management practices, based on the lessons learned since the start of the recent credit crisis in 2007, as well as a regulatory model
	with a clear internal separation of conduct of business and prudential regulation. Implications of these rules include better liquidity and risk management capability (including the use of stress testing and contingency funding plans), less reliance
	on short-term wholesale funding, and a heightened reliance on higher amounts and quality of liquid asset securities (such as government securities), leading to an increased likelihood of surviving a severe liquidity stress event, the overarching
	principles being self-sufficiency and adequacy of liquid resources. Currently, we have subsidiaries and branches regulated by the FCA (BGC Brokers L.P., the U.K. branch of Aurel BGC, GFI Securities Ltd. and GFI Brokers Limited).

	The commercial soundness of many financial institutions may be closely interrelated as a result of credit, trading,
	clearing or other relationships between the institutions. For example, we rely on Cantor as our clearing agent under the Clearing Agreement for certain securities transactions, primarily U.S. government securities, while we self-clear certain other
	products. A default by one of our customers could lead to liquidity concerns in our business and, to the extent that Cantor or another entity that clears for us has difficulty meeting capital requirements or otherwise meeting its obligations, we may
	need to provide our own liquidity.

	As a result, concerns about, or a default or threatened default by, one institution could lead to
	significant market-wide liquidity problems, losses or defaults by other institutions. This is sometimes referred to as &#147;systemic risk&#148; and may adversely affect financial intermediaries, such as clearing agencies, clearing houses, banks,
	securities firms and exchanges, with which we interact on a daily basis, and therefore could adversely affect us. Similarly, our vendors, including insurance companies and other providers, are subject to normal business risks as well as risks
	related to U.S. and international economic and market conditions. Failure of any of these vendor institutions could also materially adversely affect us.

	The credit ratings and associated outlooks of firms in our financial services industries, including us, may be critical to their reputation
	and operational and financial success. A firm&#146;s credit ratings and associated outlooks are influenced by a number of factors, including but not limited to: operating environment, earnings and profitability trends, the prudence of funding and
	liquidity management practices, balance sheet size/composition and resulting leverage, cash flow coverage of interest, composition and size of the capital base, available liquidity, outstanding borrowing levels, the firm&#146;s competitive position
	in the industry and its relationship with other firms. A credit rating and/or the associated outlook can be revised upward or downward at any time by a rating agency if such rating agency decides that circumstances of that firm or related firms
	warrant such a change. Any reduction in credit ratings and/or the associated outlook could adversely affect the availability of debt financing on acceptable terms, as well as the cost and other terms upon which any such financing can be obtained. In
	addition, credit ratings and associated outlooks may be important to customers or counterparties in certain markets and in certain transactions. Additional collateral may be required in the event of a credit ratings or outlook downgrade.

	Our activities are
	subject to credit and performance risks. For example, our customers may not deliver securities to one of our operating subsidiaries which has sold those securities to another customer. If the securities due to be delivered have increased in value,
	there is a risk that we may have to expend our own funds in connection with the purchase of other securities to consummate the transaction. While we will take steps to ensure that our customers and counterparties have high credit standings and that
	financing transactions are adequately collateralized, the large dollar amounts that may be involved in our broker-dealer and financing transactions could subject us to significant losses if, as a result of customer or counterparty failures to meet
	commitments, we were to incur significant costs in liquidating or covering our positions in the open market.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:8%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	We have adopted policies and
	procedures to identify, monitor and manage credit risk, in both agency and principal transactions, through reporting and control procedures and by monitoring credit standards applicable to our customers and counterparties. These policies and
	procedures, however, may not be fully effective, particularly against fraud, unauthorized trading and similar incidents. Some of these risk management methods depend upon the evaluation of information regarding markets, customers, counterparties or
	other matters that are publicly available or otherwise accessible by us. That information may not, in all cases, be accurate, complete, up-to-date or properly evaluated. If our policies and procedures are not fully effective or we are not always
	successful in monitoring or evaluating the risks to which we are, or may be, exposed, our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and prospects could be materially adversely affected. In addition, our insurance policies do not provide
	coverage for these risks.

	Transactions executed on a matched principal basis where the instrument has the same or similar characteristics
	to the counterparty may expose us to correlation risk. In this case, the counterparty&#146;s inability to meet its obligations will also result in the value of the instrument declining. For example, if we were to enter into a transaction to sell to
	a customer a bond or structured note where the issuer or credit support provider was such customer&#146;s affiliate, the value of the instrument would decline in value in tandem with the default. This correlation has the effect of magnifying the
	credit loss.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:8%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	We are subject to financing risk because, if a transaction does not settle on a timely basis, the resulting unmatched
	position may need to be financed, either directly by us or through one of the clearing organizations, at our expense. These charges may be recoverable from the failing counterparty, but sometimes they are not. In addition, in instances where the
	unmatched position or failure to deliver is prolonged or widespread due to rapid or widespread declines in liquidity for an instrument, there may also be regulatory capital charges required to be taken by us, which, depending on their size and
	duration, could limit our business flexibility or even force the curtailment of those portions of our businesses requiring higher levels of capital. Credit or settlement losses of this nature could materially adversely affect our businesses,
	financial condition, results of operations and prospects.

	Declines in the financial markets have also led to the exposure of several cases of financial
	fraud. If we were to have trading activity on an agency or principal basis with an entity engaged in defrauding investors or counterparties, we could bear the risk that the counterparty would not have the financial resources to meet their
	obligations, resulting in a credit loss. Similarly, we may engage in financial transactions with third parties that have been victims of financial fraud and, therefore, may not have the financial resources to meet their obligations to us.

	In agency transactions, we charge a commission for connecting buyers and sellers and assisting in the negotiation of the price and other

	In certain financial products, we act as a &#147;name

	Some of these litigation risks may be mitigated by any commercial insurance we maintain in

	independently-owned offices in the U.S. and elsewhere in the Americas in return for contractual and referral fees paid to us and/or certain mutually beneficial co-branding and other business arrangements. These independently owned offices generally
	use some variation of Newmark in their names and marketing materials. These agreements are normally multi-year contracts, and generally provide for mutual referrals in their respective markets, generating additional contract and brokerage fees.
	Through these independently owned offices, our clients have access to additional brokers with local market research capabilities as well as other commercial real estate services in locations where we do not have a physical presence. From time to
	time our arrangement with these independent firms may be terminated pursuant to the terms of the individual affiliation agreements. The opening of an owned office to replace an independently-owned office requires us to invest capital, which in some
	cases could be material. In the event our affiliation arrangements are terminated, we may lose our market coverage in such market if we do not enter into a replacement affiliation arrangement or open or acquire an owned office. There can be no

	While we believe that our BGC Holdings partnership structure promotes recruitment and retention and motivation of our
	employee partners, some employee partners may be more attracted to the benefits of working at a privately controlled partnership, or at a public company with a different compensation structure than our own, which may adversely affect our ability to
	recruit, retain, compensate and motivate these persons. While BGC Holdings limited partnership interests entitle founding/working and other limited partners to participate in distributions of income from the operations of our businesses, upon
	leaving BGC Holdings (or upon any other redemption or purchase of such limited partnership interests, as described below), any such founding/working or other limited partners are, unless Cantor, in the case of the founding partners, and us, as the
	general partner of BGC Holdings, otherwise determine, only entitled to receive over time, and provided he or she does not violate certain partner obligations, an amount for his or her BGC Holdings limited partnership interests that reflects such
	partner&#146;s capital account or post-termination amount, if any, and not any goodwill or going concern value of our businesses. Further, certain partner units have no right to a post-termination payment, receive a preferred but fixed distribution
	amount, and/or cannot be made exchangeable into shares of our Class&nbsp;A common stock. Moreover, unless and until units are made exchangeable, limited partners have no unilateral right to exchange their BGC Holdings limited partnership interests

	The BGC Holdings limited partnership interests are also subject to redemption, and subject
	founding/working and other limited partners to non-competition and non-solicitation covenants, as well as other obligations. In addition, the exercise of Cantor&#146;s right to purchase from BGC Holdings exchangeable limited partnership interests
	generally when founding partner units are redeemed or granted exchangeability will result in the share of distributions of income from the operations of our businesses on other outstanding BGC Holdings limited partnership interests, including those
	held by founding/working and other limited partners, to remain the same rather than increasing as would be the case if such interests were redeemed or granted exchangeability without such Cantor right to purchase. In addition, any purchase of
	exchangeable limited partnership units by Cantor from BGC Holdings following Cantor&#146;s decision to grant exchangeability on founding partner units will result in additional dilution to the other partners of BGC Holdings.

	the dilution mitigation under the capped call transactions will be limited based on such capped value, which means there would be dilution with respect to the Class&nbsp;A common stock to the extent that the then volume-weighted average price per

	In connection with hedging the capped call transactions, we believe the hedge counterparties may enter into, or may unwind, various derivative
	transactions with respect to and/or purchase or sell our Class&nbsp;A common stock in secondary market transactions. Such arbitrage and hedging activities could have the effect of causing or avoiding an increase or decrease in the trading price of
	the Class&nbsp;A common stock, including during any cash settlement averaging period relating to a conversion of the notes and following any conversion of the notes and during the period prior to the maturity date. The effect, if any, of any of
	these transactions and activities on our Class&nbsp;A common stock will depend in part on market conditions and cannot be ascertained at this time, but any of these activities could materially adversely affect the market for and trading price of our
	Class&nbsp;A common stock.

	quarter.

	The declaration, payment, timing and amount of any future dividends payable by us will be at the
	sole discretion of our board of directors. We are a holding company, with no direct operations, and therefore we are able to pay dividends only from our available cash on hand and funds received from distributions from BGC U.S. and BGC Global. Our
	ability to pay dividends may also be limited by regulatory considerations as well as by covenants contained in financing or other agreements. In addition, under Delaware law, dividends may be payable only out of surplus, which is our net assets
	minus our capital (as defined under Delaware law), or, if we have no surplus, out of our net profits for the fiscal year in which the dividend is declared and/or the preceding fiscal year. Accordingly, any unanticipated accounting, tax, regulatory
	or other charges against net income may adversely affect our ability to declare dividends. While we intend to declare and pay dividends quarterly, there can be no assurance that our board of directors will declare dividends at all or on a regular
	basis or that the amount of our dividends will not change.

	The performance graph below shows a comparison of the cumulative total stockholder return, on a net dividend reinvestment basis, of $100
	invested on December&nbsp;31, 2010, measured on December&nbsp;31, 2011,&nbsp;December&nbsp;31, 2012,&nbsp;December&nbsp;31, 2013,&nbsp;December&nbsp;31, 2014 and December&nbsp;31, 2015. Peer Group 1 consists of Compagnie Financi&egrave;re Tradition
	SA, ICAP plc and Tullet Prebon plc. Peer Group 2 consists of CBRE Group Inc., Colliers International Group Inc., and Jones Lang Lasalle Inc. On June&nbsp;2, 2015, First Service Corporation became Colliers International Group Inc. and spun off its
	residential property management and property services business into a separately traded public company. The stock performance of Colliers International Group Inc. before June&nbsp;2, 2015 reflects the performance of the combined FirstService
	Corporation. The returns of the peer group companies have been weighted according to their stock market capitalization for purposes of arriving at a peer group average. Total returns are shown on a &#147;net dividend&#148; basis, which tax effects
	dividend reinvestments from companies operating under certain U.K and European tax jurisdictions, according to local tax laws.

	We entered into the commercial real estate business in October 2011 with the acquisition of Newmark&nbsp;&amp; Company Real Estate, Inc.
	(&#147;Newmark&#148;), a leading U.S. commercial real estate brokerage and advisory firm primarily serving corporate and institutional clients. Newmark was founded in 1929 in New York City. In 2000, Newmark embarked upon a national expansion and in
	2006 entered into an agreement with London-based Knight Frank to operate jointly in the Americas as &#147;Newmark Knight Frank.&#148; In the second quarter of 2012, we completed the acquisition of substantially all of the assets of Grubb&nbsp;&amp;
	Ellis Company and its direct and indirect subsidiaries, which we refer to as &#147;Grubb&nbsp;&amp; Ellis.&#148; Grubb&nbsp;&amp; Ellis was formed in 1958 and built a full-service national commercial real estate platform of property management,
	facilities management and brokerage services. Grubb&nbsp;&amp; Ellis was integrated with Newmark Knight Frank to form the resulting brand, Newmark Grubb Knight Frank (&#147;NGKF&#148;). NGKF is a full-service commercial real estate platform that
	comprises our Real Estate Services segment, offering commercial real estate tenants, owners, investors and developers a wide range of services, including leasing and corporate advisory, investment sales, and real estate finance, consulting, project

	We remain confident in
	our future growth prospects as we continue to increase the scale and depth of our Financial Services and Real Estate Services platforms and continue to seek market-driven opportunities to expand our business in numerous financial asset classes. This
	was exemplified by the successful completion of our tender offer for the majority of GFI&#146;s outstanding common shares. Beginning in the first quarter of 2015, BGC began consolidating the results of GFI, which continues to operate as a separately
	branded division of BGC. On January&nbsp;12, 2016, we completed the merger with GFI by acquiring 100 percent of GFI&#146;s outstanding shares (see &#147;Successful Completion of Tender Offer to Acquire GFI Group, Inc.&#148;). We also completed the
	purchase of remaining Apartment Realty Advisers (&#147;ARA&#148;) members, Computerized Facility Integration (&#147;CFI&#148;), Excess Space, Steffner Commercial Real Estate (which operates as Newmark Grubb Memphis), and Cincinnati Commercial Real
	Estate (&#147;CCR&#148;) during this year. By adding these leading companies to our platform, we have greatly broadened the scope and depth of services we can provide to our clients across our consolidated business. We have continued to make key
	hires around the world and integrate other recent acquisitions onto our global platform. We expect these additions to increase our revenues and earnings per share going forward. These investments underscore BGC&#146;s ongoing commitment to make
	accretive acquisitions and profitable hires.

	March&nbsp;4, 2015 in the aggregate amount of $331.1 million. On April&nbsp;28, 2015, we purchased from GFI approximately 43.0&nbsp;million new shares at that date&#146;s closing price of $5.81 per share, for an aggregate purchase price of $250
	million. The purchase price was paid to GFI in the form of a note due on June&nbsp;19, 2018 that bore an interest rate of LIBOR plus 200 basis points. The new shares and the note eliminate in consolidation. Following the issuance of the new shares,
	we owned approximately 67% of GFI&#146;s outstanding common stock, which gave us control over the timing and process for the completion of a back-end merger (the &#147;Back-End Mergers&#148;) pursuant to the tender offer agreement.

	On January&nbsp;12, 2016, we completed our acquisition (the &#147;JPI Merger&#148;) of Jersey Partners, Inc. (&#147;JPI&#148;). The JPI Merger
	occurred pursuant to a merger agreement (the &#147;Merger Agreement&#148;), dated as of December&nbsp;22, 2015. Shortly following the completion of the JPI Merger, a subsidiary of BGC merged with and into GFI pursuant to a short-form merger under
	Delaware law, with GFI continuing as the surviving entity (the &#147;GFI Merger&#148;). The Back-End Mergers allowed BGC to acquire the remaining approximately 33 percent of the outstanding shares of GFI common stock that BGC did not already
	own.&nbsp;Following the closing of the Back-End Mergers, BGC and its affiliates now own 100 percent of the outstanding shares of GFI&#146;s common stock. See Note 4&#151;&#147;Acquisitions&#148; to the consolidated financial statements in Part II,

	In total, approximately
	23.5&nbsp;million shares of BGC Class&nbsp;A Common Stock and $111.3 million in cash were issued or paid with respect to the closing of the Back-End Mergers, inclusive of adjustments.&nbsp;The total purchase consideration for all shares of GFI
	purchased by BGC was approximately $750 million, net of the $250.0 million note previously issued to GFI by BGC, which is eliminated in consolidation.&nbsp;This figure excludes the $29.0 million gain recorded in the first quarter of 2015 with
	respect to the appreciation of the 17.1&nbsp;million shares of GFI held by BGC prior to the successful completion of the tender offer. The excess of total consideration over the fair value of the total net assets acquired, of approximately $453.8
	million, has been recorded to goodwill and was allocated to our Financial Services.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:8%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	We believe the combination of BGC and GFI creates a
	strong and diversified Financial Services business, well positioned to capture future growth opportunities. Through this combination, we expect to deliver substantial benefits to customers of the combined company, and we expect to become the largest
	and most profitable wholesale brokerage company. We also believe this is a highly complementary combination, which will result in meaningful economies of scale. While the front office operations will remain separately branded divisions, the back
	office, technology, and infrastructure of these two companies are integrating in a smart and deliberate way. In the fourth quarter of 2015, we met our target of reducing Financial Services annualized expenses by at least $50 million by the first
	quarter of 2016. We had previously expected a minimum of $40 million in further annualized cost savings by the first quarter of 2017, for a total of at least $90 million in annual savings. We now anticipate achieving a minimum of $100 million in
	annual savings by the end of 2016. The improvement to our pre-tax profitability we expect to achieve with the $100 million in annualized cost savings will be at least 25 percent higher than the full year revenues of Trayport, which we have sold to
	ICE for $650 million on December&nbsp;11, 2015.

	On July&nbsp;10, 2015, the Company guaranteed the obligations of GFI under the 8.375%
	Senior Notes; as a consequence of guaranteeing GFI&#146;s debt, we have substantially improved the credit rating of GFI&#146;s bonds and lowered future interest payments. We have also been able to free up capital set aside for regulatory and
	clearing purposes, allowing us to use our balance sheet more efficiently. As the integration of BGC and GFI continues, we expect to generate increased productivity per broker and to continue converting voice and hybrid broking to more profitable
	fully electronic trading, all of which should lead to increased revenues, profitability and cash flows. In addition, we expect our results to further improve as we invest the net proceeds from the $650 million Trayport sale.

	pursuant to a Stock Purchase Agreement, dated as of November&nbsp;15, 2015. At the closing, we received 2,527,658 shares of ICE common stock issued with respect to the $650 million purchase price, which was adjusted at closing.&nbsp;Trayport, prior
	to its sale, had generated revenues of approximately $80 million over the twelve months ended September&nbsp;30, 2015.&nbsp;BGC expects to pay effective cash taxes of no more than $64 million related to the Trayport purchase price, or an expected
	rate of less than 10 percent.

	The financial intermediary sector has been a competitive area that grew over the first half of the past decade due to several factors. One
	factor was the increasing use of derivatives to manage risk or to take advantage of the anticipated direction of a market by allowing users to protect gains and/or guard against losses in the price of underlying assets without having to buy or sell
	the underlying assets. Derivatives are often used to mitigate the risks associated with interest rates, equity ownership, changes in the value of foreign currency, credit defaults by corporate and sovereign debtors and changes in the prices of
	commodity products. For the period from 1998 through 2007, demand from financial institutions, financial services intermediaries and large corporations has increased volumes in the wholesale derivatives market, thereby increasing the business
	opportunity for financial intermediaries.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:8%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Another key factor in the growth of the financial intermediary sector during the same timeframe
	was the increase in the number of new financial products. As market participants and their customers strive to mitigate risk, new types of equity and fixed income securities, futures, options and other financial instruments have been developed. Most
	of these new securities and derivatives are not immediately ready for more liquid and standardized electronic markets, and generally increase the need for trading and require broker-assisted execution.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:8%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	In recent years, our Financial Services businesses have faced more challenging market conditions. While our foreign exchange (&#147;FX&#148;),
	energy and commodities, and equities and other businesses operated in a generally improved macro environment in recent periods, our credit and rates businesses have continued to face a challenging macro environment that has been part of a greater
	industry trend which has been attributed to a number of cyclical factors, including accommodative monetary policies by several major central banks including the Federal Reserve, Bank of England, Bank of Japan and the European Central Bank. These
	accommodative monetary policies have resulted in historically low levels of volatility and interest rates across most financial markets. The global credit markets have also faced structural issues such as increased bank capital requirements under
	Basel III. Consequently, these factors have contributed to lower trading volumes in our rates and credit asset classes across most geographies in which we operate.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:8%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Regulators in the U.S. have finalized most of the new rules across a range of financial marketplaces, including OTC derivatives, as mandated
	by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (&#147;Dodd-Frank Act&#148;). Many of these rules became effective in prior years, while ongoing phase-ins are anticipated over coming years. Legislators and regulators in Europe and
	the Asia-Pacific region have crafted similar rules, some of which have already been implemented, specifically those falling under the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive II (&#147;MiFID II&#148;), while others are expected to be implemented
	in the future.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:8%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	These OTC-related regulations and proposed rules call for, among other actions, additional pre- and post-trade market
	transparency, heightened collateral and capital standards, the transacting of certain derivatives using authorized venues, central clearing of most standardized derivatives, specific business conduct standards and the delivery of transaction data to
	newly designated trade repositories for public dissemination.

	Act compliant execution on SEFs by eligible U.S. persons commenced in February 2014 for &#147;made available to trade&#148; products, and a wide range of other rules relating to the execution and clearing of derivative products have been finalized
	with implementation periods in 2016 and beyond. We also maintain our ownership stake in ELX, a CFTC-approved designated contract market (&#147;DCM&#148;).

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:8%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	We believe that our relative competitive position is strong in this changing environment, and that we will gain market share. This is because
	the new rules not only require OTC market execution venues to maintain robust front-end and back-office IT capabilities and to make large and ongoing technology investments, but also because recent revisions to the execution methodology rules will
	allow elements of voice brokerage to flourish. We are a leader in both the breadth and scale of our hybrid and fully electronic trading capability, and we expect to outperform our competitors in such an environment.

	Volume is driven by a number of items, including the level of issuance for financial instruments, the price volatility of financial
	instruments, macro-economic conditions, the creation and adoption of new products, the regulatory environment, and the introduction and adoption of new trading technologies. In general, increased price volatility increases the demand for hedging
	instruments, including many of the cash and derivative products that we broker.

	Rates volumes in particular are influenced by market
	volatility, which has recently begun its rise as compared with recent averages. Central bank quantitative easing globally has reduced volumes because it entails the central banks buying government securities or other securities in the open
	market&#151;particularly longer-dated instruments&#151;in an effort to promote increased lending and liquidity and bring down long-term interest rates. When central banks hold these instruments, they tend not to trade or hedge&#151;thus lowering
	rates volumes across cash and derivatives markets industry-wide. Despite the conclusion of its Quantitative Easing program in the fourth quarter of 2014, the U.S. Federal Reserve still had over $3.7 trillion worth of long-dated U.S. Treasury and
	Federal Agency securities as of January&nbsp;1, 2016, compared with $1.7 trillion at the beginning of 2011 and zero prior to September 2008. Additionally, the U.S. Federal Reserve has continued to roll over its existing positions and it is expected
	to keep its balance sheet at elevated levels for the foreseeable future. Other major central banks have also greatly increased the amount of longer-dated debt on their balance sheets over the past few years and have indicated that they may continue
	to do so.

	In addition, the G-20 central banks have agreed to implement the Basel III accord. Basel III was drafted with the intention of
	making banks more stable in the wake of the financial crisis. The accord, which will be phased in over the next few years, will force most large banks in G-20 nations to hold approximately three times as much Tier 1 capital as is required under the
	previous set of rules. These capital rules make it more expensive for banks to hold non-sovereign debt assets on their balance sheets, and as a result, analysts say banks have reduced or will reduce their trading activity in corporate and
	asset-backed fixed income securities as well as in various other OTC cash and derivative instruments. We believe that this has further reduced overall industry volumes in many of the products we broker, particularly in credit.

	During the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2015, industry volumes were generally mixed year-on-year for the OTC and listed products we broker in
	rates, credit, FX, equities, energy and commodities. For example, volumes were generally up within equities, energy and commodities, FX futures, and European interest rate futures, while volumes were generally down within U.S. interest rate futures,

	Our rates business is influenced by a number of factors, including global sovereign issuances, secondary trading and the hedging of these
	sovereign debt instruments. While the amount of global sovereign debt outstanding remains high by historical standards, the level of secondary trading and related hedging activity remains muted. For example, according to the Securities Industry and
	Financial Markets Association (&#147;SIFMA&#148;), the average daily volume of U.S. Treasuries among primary dealers was flat during the fourth quarter of 2015 as compared with a year earlier. Additionally, interest rate volumes were down by
	approximately 18% at CME, and up by 3% at Eurex. In comparison, our fully electronic rates revenues were up by approximately 37.3% from a year earlier, driven largely by the acquisition of GFI. Overall revenues from rates products were up by
	approximately 16.7% during the period to $468.5 million, primarily driven by the addition of GFI and R.P. Martin.

	Our rates revenues are not totally dependent on market volumes and therefore do not always fluctuate consistently with industry metrics. This
	is largely because our voice, hybrid, and fully electronic desks in rates often have volume discounts built into their price structure, which results in our rates revenues being less volatile than the overall industry volumes.

	Overall, analysts and economists expect the absolute level of sovereign debt outstanding to remain at elevated levels for the foreseeable
	future as governments finance their future deficits and roll over their sizable existing debt. For example, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (&#147;OECD&#148;)&#151;which includes almost all of the advanced and developed

	in 2007. Meanwhile, economists expect that the effects of various forms of quantitative easing will continue to negatively impact financial markets, as economic growth remains weak in most OECD countries. As a result, we expect long-term tailwinds
	in our rates business from continuing high levels of government debt, but continued near-term headwinds due to the continued accommodative monetary policy of many major central banks.

	Global FX volumes were generally mixed during 2015, as the fourth quarter reflected the anticipated and eventual rise of U.S. interest rates
	for the first time since 2006. Additionally, FX volumes were impacted by the intervention and support of certain emerging market currencies by their respective central governments. Thus, spot FX at Thomson Reuters was down 6%, while FX futures at

	The cash portion of our credit business is impacted by the level of global corporate bond issuance, while both the cash and credit derivatives
	side of this business are impacted by sovereign and corporate issuance. Global credit derivative market turnover has declined over the last few years due to the introduction of rules and regulation for the clearing of credit derivatives in the U.S.
	and elsewhere, along with non-uniform regulation across different geographies.&nbsp;In addition, many of our large bank customers continue to reduce their inventory of bonds and other credit products in order to comply with Basel III and other

	Historically, technology-based product growth has led to higher margins and greater profits over time for exchanges and wholesale
	financial intermediaries alike, even if overall company revenues remain consistent. This is largely because fewer employees are needed to process the same volume of trades as trading becomes more automated. Over time, electronification of
	exchange-traded and OTC markets has also generally led to volumes increasing faster than commissions decline, and thus often to an overall increase in revenues. We have been a pioneer in creating and encouraging hybrid and fully electronic trading,
	and we continually work with our customers to expand such trading across more asset classes and geographies.

	Outside of U.S. Treasuries
	and spot FX, the banks and broker-dealers that dominate the OTC markets had generally been hesitant in adopting electronically traded products. However, in recent years, hybrid and fully electronic wholesale OTC markets for products, including CDS
	indices, FX options, and most recently interest rate swaps, have been created as banks and dealers have become more open to electronically traded products and as firms like us have invested in the kinds of technology favored by our customers.
	Recently enacted and pending regulation in Asia, Europe and the U.S. regarding banking, capital markets, and OTC derivatives has accelerated the adoption of fully electronic trading and we expect to benefit from the rules and regulation surrounding
	OTC derivatives.&nbsp;Our understanding is that the rules that have been adopted or are being finalized will continue to allow for trading through a variety of means, including voice, and we believe the net impact of these rules and additional bank
	capital requirements will encourage the growth of fully electronic trading for a number of products we broker.

	the strong organic growth generated by our market data and software solutions products. We offer electronically traded products on a significant portion of our Financial Services segment&#146;s hundreds of brokerage desks. The revenues, profits, and
	growth of these products are more than double those of eSpeed, which we sold in the second quarter of 2013 for over $1.2 billion. The financial results and strong momentum of FENICS also compare favorably to other highly valuable electronic trading

	Cornish&nbsp;&amp; Carey, and Excess Space along with strong organic growth. While we benefited from positive industry trends, we believe that NGKF continued to gain market share. Our Real Estate management services and other revenues were up by
	15.0%; and overall revenues improved by 40.9%. Our acquisitions of Cornish&nbsp;&amp; Carey and ARA are expected to continue to drive future growth of our Real Estate Services business, particularly in the higher margin capital markets brokerage

	We expect the overall profitability of our Real Estate Services business to increase as we increase its size and scale. However,
	the pre-tax margins in the segment are also impacted by the mix of revenues generated by NGKF. For example, real estate capital markets, which includes sales, commercial mortgage broking, and other real estate-related financial services, generally
	has larger transactions that occur with less frequency and more seasonality when compared with leasing advisory. However, real estate capital markets tend to have significantly higher pre-tax margins than NGKF as a whole. Leasing advisory revenues
	are generally more predictable than revenues from real estate capital markets, while pre-tax earnings margins tend to be more similar to those of the segment as a whole. Property and facilities management, which together are called &#147;real estate
	management services,&#148; generally have the most predictable and steady revenues, but with pre-tax earnings margins below those for NGKF as a whole. When management services clients agree to give us exclusive rights to provide real estate services
	for their facilities or properties, it is for an extended period of time, which provides us with stable and foreseeable sources of brokerage revenues.

	The U.S commercial property market continues to display considerable strength, posting twenty-three consecutive quarters of gains in commercial
	property prices, as measured by the Commercial Property Price Index, reported by Moody&#146;s Real Capital Analytics (&#147;RCA&#148;). Additionally, U.S. commercial real estate sales volumes have increased year-on-year in twenty-four of the last
	twenty-five quarters, as reported by RCA. If the U.S. economy continues to expand at the moderate pace envisioned by many economists, we would expect this to fuel the continued expansion of demand for commercial real estate.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:8%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	According to CoStar&#146;s Value-Weighted U.S. Composite Index, average prices were up by over 12% year-over-year for the twelve-months ended
	November 2015. During 2015, the dollar volume of significant property sales totaled $533 billion in the U.S., up by 23% from the year ago period according to RCA. In comparison, our real estate capital markets revenue increased approximately 115.0%
	year-over-year, primarily due to growth resulting from the acquisitions of ARA and Cornish&nbsp;&amp; Carey in addition to strong organic growth.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:8%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Although overall industry metrics are not necessarily as correlated to our revenues in Real Estate Services as they are in Financial Services,
	they do provide some indication of the general direction of the business. According to Newmark Grubb Knight Frank Research, the combined average vacancy rate for office, industrial, and retail properties ended the year at 7.9% down from 8.5% a year
	earlier, marking twenty-three consecutive quarters of improving average vacancy rates. Rents for all property types in the U.S. continued to improve modestly. According to NGKF Research, leasing activity during 2015 was roughly flat with the year
	ago period. In comparison, revenues from our leasing and other services business grew by approximately 28.9%.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:8%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	A key driver of our revenue is front-office headcount. We believe that our strong technology platform and unique partnership structure have
	enabled us to use both acquisitions and recruiting to profitably increase our front-office staff at a faster rate than our largest competitors since our formation in 2004.

	We have invested significantly to capitalize on the current business
	environment through acquisitions, technology spending and the hiring of new brokers, salespeople, managers and other front-office personnel. The business climate for these acquisitions has been competitive, and it is expected that these conditions
	will persist for the foreseeable future. We have been able to attract businesses and brokers, salespeople, managers and other front-office personnel to our platform as we believe they recognize that we have the scale, technology, experience and
	expertise to succeed in the current business environment.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:8%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	As of December&nbsp;31, 2015, our front-office headcount was up by 35%
	year-over-year to 3,855 brokers, salespeople, managers and other front-office personnel. This increase was primarily due to the acquisitions made throughout the year. For the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2015, average revenue generated per
	front-office employee increased by 2% from a year ago to approximately $638,000. The increase in overall company revenue per front-office employee was primarily driven by strong performance in our Real Estate Services business.

	BGC&#146;s average revenue per front office employee has historically declined year-over-year for the periods following significant headcount increases, because the additional brokers and
	salespeople generally achieve significantly higher productivity levels in their second year with the Company.

	The laws and regulations
	passed or proposed on both sides of the Atlantic concerning OTC trading seem likely to favor increased use of technology by all market participants, and are likely to accelerate the adoption of both hybrid and fully electronic trading. We believe
	these developments will favor the larger inter-dealer brokers over smaller, non-public inter-dealer brokers, as the smaller ones generally do not have the financial resources to invest the necessary amounts in technology. We believe this will lead
	to further consolidation across the wholesale financial brokerage industry, and thus further allow us to profitably grow our front-office headcount.

	During 2014 in
	our Real Estate Services business we completed the acquisition of members of ARA, the nation&#146;s largest privately held, multi-housing brokerage and the acquisition of Cornish&nbsp;&amp; Carey, the leading commercial real estate services company
	in the Bay Area and Silicon Valley. ARA had approximately 100 brokers with offices nationwide and completed more than $3.3 billion in multi-family sales in the first nine months of 2014. Cornish&nbsp;&amp; Carey had over 275 brokers and generated
	approximately $135 million in revenues in 2013. Accordingly, we have greatly broadened the scope and depth of services we can provide to our clients in Northern California and across the U.S.

	On February&nbsp;26, 2015, we announced the successful completion of our tender offer for the majority of GFI Group, Inc.&#146;s outstanding
	common shares. GFI is a leading intermediary in the global OTC and Listed markets, offering an array of sophisticated trading technologies and products and generated over $880 million in revenues in 2014, which included revenues from their Trayport
	and Kyte businesses, which have since been sold. The acquisition of GFI represented the largest acquisition in our history. On January&nbsp;12, 2016, we completed the merger with GFI by acquiring the approximately 33% of the remaining shares of GFI.
	This combination dramatically increases the scale and scope of the Company and the combined company is now the largest interdealer-broker and wholesale financial broker in the industry.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:8%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">

	systems integration firm that manages over three billion square feet globally for Fortune 500 companies, owner-occupiers, government agencies, healthcare and higher education clients. CFI provides corporate real estate, facilities management, and
	enterprise asset management information consulting and technology solutions that yield hundreds of millions of dollars in cost-savings for its client base on an annual basis. The acquisition is expected to complement and drive future growth

	We earn

	transaction. After all material terms of a transaction are agreed upon, we identify the buyer and seller to each other and leave them to settle the trade directly. Principal transaction revenues are primarily derived from matched principal
	transactions, whereby revenues are earned on the spread between the buy and the sell price of the brokered security, commodity or derivative. Customers either see the buy or sell price on a screen or are given this information over the phone. The
	brokerage fee is then added to the buy or sell price, which represents the spread we earn as principal transactions revenues. On a limited basis, we enter into unmatched principal transactions to facilitate a customer&#146;s execution needs for
	transactions initiated by such customers. We also provide market data products for selected financial institutions.

	As the above table indicates, our brokerage operations in the rates product category produce a
	significant percentage of our total brokerage revenues. We expect that revenues from our rates product brokerage operations will increase in absolute terms, but decline as a percentage of revenues as we continue to invest in expanding in other asset
	classes. These factors have enabled us to provide our client base with robust services across global markets.

	Our position as a leading
	wholesale financial broker is enhanced by our hybrid brokerage platform. We believe that the more complex, less liquid markets on which we focus often require significant amounts of personal and attentive service from our brokers. In more mature
	markets, we offer fully electronic trading capabilities to our customers through our platforms including FENICS and BGC Trader. Our hybrid platform allows our customers to trade on a voice, hybrid or, where available, fully electronic basis,
	regardless of whether the trade is OTC or exchange-based, and to benefit from the experience and market intelligence of our worldwide brokerage network. Our electronic capabilities include clearing, settlement, post-trade, and other back-office
	services as well as straight-through processing for our customers across several products. Furthermore, we benefit from the operational leverage in our fully electronic platform. We believe our hybrid brokerage approach provides a competitive
	advantage over competitors who do not offer this full range of technology.

	The majority of our operating costs consist of cash and non-cash compensation expenses, which include base salaries, broker bonuses based on
	broker production, guaranteed bonuses, other discretionary bonuses, and all related employee benefits and taxes. Our employees consist of brokers, executives and other administrative support. The majority of our brokers receive a base salary and a

	As part of our compensation plans certain employees are granted

	Certain of these limited partnership units entitle the holders to receive post-termination
	payments equal to the notional amount in four equal yearly installments after the holder&#146;s termination. These limited partnership units are accounted for as post-termination liability awards under FASB guidance, which requires that we record an
	expense for such awards based on the change in value at each reporting period and include the expense in our consolidated statements of operations as part of &#147;Compensation and employee benefits.&#148; The liability for limited partnership units
	with a post-termination payout amount is included in &#147;Accrued compensation&#148; on our consolidated statements of financial condition.

	FPUs&#148; in our consolidated statements of operations.

	and distribution of the quarterly partnership distribution for the remaining partnership units. The Preferred Units are not entitled to participate in partnership distributions other than with respect to the Preferred Distribution. Preferred Units

	FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS

</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:8%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	For the year ended December 31, 2015, we had income from operations before income taxes of $388.8 million compared to a loss from operations
	before income taxes of $3.2 million in the year earlier period. Our results include the results of GFI beginning in the first quarter of 2015. Total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2015 increased approximately $787.9 million to $2,575.4
	million primarily due to a $685.4 million increase in brokerage revenues. This significant improvement was driven by the addition of GFI, the ongoing success of NGKF, our Real Estate Services segment and the continued strong double digit growth of
	our high margin FENICS fully electronic businesses. Total expenses increased approximately $874.5 million to $2,706.0 million primarily due to a $696.9 million increase in total compensation and employee benefits. Also contributing to the increase
	was a $177.6 million increase in total non-compensation

	expenses. The absolute increase in expenses was primarily due to the impact of acquisitions. While the front-office operations of GFI and BGC will remain separately branded, we have already begun
	integrating the support functions, technology, and infrastructure of these two companies. We met our target of reducing Financial Services annualized expenses by at least $50 million by the first quarter of 2016. We had previously expected a minimum
	of $40 million in further annualized cost savings by the first quarter of 2017, for a total of at least $90 million in annual savings. We now anticipate achieving a minimum of $100 million in annual savings by the end of 2016. The improvement to our
	pre-tax profitability we expect to achieve with the $100 million in annualized cost savings will be at least 25 percent higher than the full year revenues of Trayport. This excludes the impact of any potential future acquisitions or net increase in
	headcount due to hires made going forward. We also expect to increase productivity per broker and to continue converting voice and hybrid broking to higher margin fully electronic trading, all of which should lead to increased revenues and
	profitability. By freeing up duplicative capital set aside for regulatory and clearing purposes in connection with the GFI integration, we will also be able to use our balance sheet more efficiently.

	On December&nbsp;11, 2015, we completed the sale of all of the equity interests in the entities that make up the Trayport business to
	ICE.&nbsp;At the closing, we received 2,527,658 shares of ICE common stock issued with respect to the $650 million purchase price, which was adjusted at closing.&nbsp;Trayport, prior to its sale, had generated revenues of approximately $80 million
	over the twelve months ended September&nbsp;30, 2015. During December 2015, we recorded an approximately $407 million gain, net of fees, related to the sale of Trayport and the net realized and unrealized gains on the ICE shares. Offsetting this
	gain were approximately $187 million of expenses related to non-cash and/or non-dilutive charges, aside from those that might have been expected as part of the Company&#146;s ordinary operating business. Taking these items together resulted in an
	approximately $220 million net gain. We expect our results to further improve as we invest the net proceeds from the $650 million Trayport sale.

	Our Real Estate Services business (&#147;NGKF&#148;) once again had a very strong year, as the NGKF brokerage revenues increased by
	approximately 48.7%. This significant improvement included an approximately 115.0% increase in revenues from our higher margin real estate capital markets business, 28.9% growth from leasing and other services and 14.6% growth from largely recurring
	management services fees. This impressive outperformance was driven in part by the additions of Cornish&nbsp;&amp; Carey, ARA, Computerized Facility Integration, and Excess Space. In addition, our Real Estate Services business generated strong
	organic growth as we continued to add dozens of high profile and talented brokers and other professionals, won new business, and were aided by solid commercial real estate market fundamentals. NGKF&#146;s revenues have grown at a compounded annual
	rate of approximately 32% over the last two years ended December&nbsp;31, 2015. Given our strong momentum, we expect NGKF to generate top-line growth of approximately 20 percent for year 2016.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:8%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	We believe that BGC&#146;s assets and businesses are independently worth significantly more than what is reflected in our current stock price.
	Based on recent equity market and M&amp;A multiples, we think that the market is undervaluing both NGKF and FENICS. We also believe that the market has yet to properly value the more than $760 million in additional NASDAQ stock (based on the
	February&nbsp;25, 2016 closing price) we anticipate receiving over time, which is not reflected on our balance sheet. Although no decisions have been made, we are considering a number of options designed to unlock substantial amounts of shareholder
	value. We also expect our earnings to continue to grow as we increase the profitability of GFI, add revenues from our highly profitable fully electronic products, and benefit from the strength of our Real Estate Services business. We anticipate
	having substantial resources with which to pay dividends, repurchase shares and/or units of BGC, profitably hire, and make accretive acquisitions, all while maintaining or improving our investment grade rating.

	of NASDAQ stock. The increased income was driven by the year-over-year increase in the share price.

	sale of eSpeed. Our consolidated effective tax rate can vary from period to period depending on, among other factors, the geographic and business mix of our earnings.

	Our
	balance sheet and business model are not capital intensive. Our assets consist largely of cash, marketable securities, collateralized and uncollateralized short-dated receivables and less liquid assets needed to support our business. Longer-term
	capital (equity and notes payable) is held to support the less liquid assets and potential capital intensive opportunities. Total assets at December&nbsp;31, 2015 were $4.0 billion, an increase of 45.1&nbsp;% as compared to December&nbsp;31, 2014.
	The increase in total assets was driven primarily by increases in marketable securities, goodwill and other intangible assets. These increases were primarily related to the acquisitions of GFI, ARA, CFI and Excess Space. We maintain a significant
	portion of our assets in cash and marketable securities, with our liquidity (which we define as cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities and securities owned) at December&nbsp;31, 2015 of $1,026.1 million. See &#147;Liquidity Analysis&#148;

	On June&nbsp;23, 2015, the Audit Committee of the Company authorized management to enter
	into a revolving credit facility with Cantor of up to $150 million in aggregate principal amount pursuant to which Cantor or BGC would be entitled to borrow funds from each other from time to time. The outstanding balances would bear interest at the
	higher of the borrower&#146;s or the lender&#146;s short term borrowing rate then in effect plus 1%. There were no borrowings outstanding under the facility as of December&nbsp;31, 2015.

	Additionally, in August 2013, the Audit Committee authorized us to invest up to $350 million in an asset-backed commercial paper program for
	which certain Cantor entities serve as placement agent and referral agent. The program issues short-term notes to money market investors and is expected to be used from time to time as a liquidity management vehicle. The notes are backed by assets
	of highly rated banks. We are entitled to invest in the program so long as the program meets investment policy guidelines, including relating to ratings. Cantor will earn a spread between the rate it receives from the short-term note issuer and the
	rate it pays to us on any investments in this program. This spread will be no greater than the spread earned by Cantor for placement of any other commercial paper note in the program. As of December&nbsp;31, 2015, we had no investments in the
	program.

	Our funding base consists of longer-term capital (equity and notes payable), shorter-term liabilities and accruals that are a natural outgrowth
	of specific assets and/or our business model, such as matched fails and accrued compensation. We have limited need for short-term unsecured funding in our regulated entities for their brokerage business. Contingent liquidity needs are largely
	limited to potential cash collateral that may be needed to meet clearing bank, clearinghouse, and exchange margins and/or to fund fails. Capital expenditures tend to be cash neutral and approximately in line with depreciation. Current cash balances
	significantly exceed our unsecured letters of credit and our unsecured bank borrowings. We believe that cash in and available to our largest regulated entities, inclusive of financing provided by clearing banks, is adequate for potential cash
	demands of normal operations such as margin or fail financing. We expect our operating activities going forward to generate adequate cash flows to fund normal operations, including any dividends issued pursuant to our dividend policy. However, we
	believe that there are a significant number of capital intensive opportunities for us to maximize our growth and strategic position, including, among other things, acquisitions, strategic alliances and joint ventures potentially involving all types
	and combinations of equity, debt and acquisition alternatives. As a result, we may need to raise additional funds to:

	downgrades to the credit rating of GFI&#146;s 8.375% Senior Notes, the 8.375% Senior Notes were previously subjected to 200 basis points penalty interest. On April&nbsp;28, 2015, a subsidiary of the Company purchased from GFI approximately
	43.0&nbsp;million newly issued shares of GFI&#146;s common stock. This increased BGC&#146;s ownership to approximately 67% of GFI&#146;s outstanding common stock and gave us the ability to control the timing and process with respect to a full

	On February&nbsp;25, 2016, we entered into a committed unsecured credit agreement with Bank of
	America, N.A., as administrative agent, and a syndicate of lenders. Several of our domestic non-regulated subsidiaries are parties to the credit agreement as guarantors. The credit agreement provides for maximum revolving loans of $150 million, with
	the option to increase the aggregate loans to $200 million. The maturity date of the facility is February&nbsp;25, 2018. Borrowings under this facility bear interest at either LIBOR or a defined base rate plus an additional margin which ranges from
	50 basis points to 250 basis points depending on our debt rating as determined by S&amp;P and Fitch and whether such loan is a LIBOR loan or a base rate loan. Contemporaneously with the closing of this credit agreement, the $25 million unsecured
	credit agreement entered into on December&nbsp;24, 2015 with Bank of America, N.A. as lender was terminated. As of February&nbsp;29, 2016, there were no borrowings outstanding under either this $150 million facility or the terminated $25 million
	facility.

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Credit ratings and associated
	outlooks are influenced by a number of factors, including but not limited to: operating environment, earnings and profitability trends, the prudence of funding and liquidity management practices, balance sheet size/composition and resulting
	leverage, cash flow coverage of interest, composition and size of the capital base, available liquidity, outstanding borrowing levels and the firm&#146;s competitive position in the industry. A credit rating and/or the associated outlook can be
	revised upward or downward at any time by a rating agency if such rating agency decides that circumstances warrant such a change. Any reduction in our credit ratings and/or the associated outlook could adversely affect the availability of debt
	financing on terms acceptable to us, as well as the cost and other terms upon which we are able to obtain any such financing. In addition, credit ratings and associated outlooks may be important to customers or counterparties when we compete in
	certain markets and when we seek to engage in certain transactions. In connection with certain agreements, we may be required to provide additional collateral in the event of a credit ratings downgrade.

	As of December&nbsp;31, 2015, the Company had $461.2 million of cash and cash equivalents, and included in this amount was $271.6 million of
	cash and cash equivalents held by foreign subsidiaries.&nbsp;With the exception of the cash proceeds from the sale of Trayport, it is our intention to permanently reinvest undistributed foreign pre-tax earnings in the Company&#146;s foreign
	operations.&nbsp;It is not practicable to determine the amount of additional tax that may be payable in the event these earnings are repatriated due to the fluctuation of the relative ownership percentages of the foreign subsidiaries between the
	Company and BGC Holdings, L.P. With respect to the sale of Trayport, management concluded that the foreign proceeds attributable to the sale of Trayport in the amount of $603.9 million will ultimately be repatriated and will provide U.S. tax on
	those amounts.&nbsp;For these proceeds which are not permanently reinvested, the deferred tax liability of $135.5 million is net of foreign tax credits, which will be generated at the time of repatriation.&nbsp;In addition, certain GFI Group net
	operating loss carryforwards are expected to be utilized to reduce cash taxes.&nbsp;Taking these items together, we therefore expect to pay effective cash taxes of no more than $64 million related to the Trayport purchase price, or an expected rate
	of less than 10 percent.

	The $30.5 million increase in our liquidity position from $795.0 million to $825.5 million as of
	December&nbsp;31, 2014 was primarily driven by the $295.1 in net proceeds from the issuance of the 5.375% Senior Notes in December 2014, partially offset by cash used for the redemption and/or repurchase of 18.9&nbsp;million shares and units at a
	cost of $139.9 million and cash used for acquisitions. The Company&#146;s calculation of liquidity as of December&nbsp;31, 2014, includes the 17.1&nbsp;million shares of GFIG that BGC and its affiliates owned, although the Company and its affiliates
	did not intend to sell these shares at that time.

	Cantor in the amount reasonably requested by Cantor under the clearing capital agreement. Cantor had not requested any cash or other property from us as collateral as of December&nbsp;31, 2015.

</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:8%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Our liquidity
	and available cash resources are restricted by regulatory requirements of our operating subsidiaries. Many of these regulators, including U.S. and non-U.S. government agencies and self-regulatory organizations, as well as state securities
	commissions in the U.S., are empowered to conduct administrative proceedings that can result in censure, fine, the issuance of cease-and-desist orders or the suspension or expulsion of a broker-dealer. In addition, self-regulatory organizations such
	as the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (&#147;FINRA&#148;) and the National Futures Association (&#147;NFA&#148;) along with statutory bodies such as the Financial Conduct Authority (&#147;FCA&#148;), the U.S. Securities and Exchange
	Commission (the &#147;SEC&#148;), and the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (the &#147;CFTC&#148;) require strict compliance with their rules and regulations. The requirements imposed by regulators are designed to ensure the integrity of the
	financial markets and to protect customers and other third parties who deal with broker-dealers and are not designed to specifically protect stockholders. These regulations often serve to limit our activities, including through net capital, customer
	protection and market conduct requirements.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:8%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The FCA is the relevant statutory regulator in the United Kingdom. The FCA was established in
	2013, and superseded the former regulatory agency, the FSA. The FCA&#146;s objectives are to protect customers, maintain the stability of the financial services industry and promote competition between financial services providers. It has broad
	rule-making, investigative and enforcement powers derived from the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 and subsequent and derivative legislation and regulations.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:8%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	In addition, the majority of our other foreign subsidiaries are subject to similar regulation by the relevant authorities in the countries in
	which they do business. Additionally, certain other of our foreign subsidiaries are required to maintain non-U.S. net capital requirements. In Hong Kong, BGC Securities (Hong Kong), LLC and GFI (HK) Securities LLC are regulated by the Securities and
	Futures Commission. BGC Capital Markets (Hong Kong), Limited and GFI (HK) Brokers Ltd, are regulated by The Hong Kong Monetary Authority. All are subject to Hong Kong net capital requirements. In France, Aurel BGC and BGC France Holdings; in
	Australia, BGC Partners (Australia) Pty Limited, BGC (Securities) and GFI Australia Pty Ltd.; in Japan, BGC Shoken Kaisha Limited&#146;s Japanese branch; in Singapore, BGC Partners (Singapore) Limited, BGC Securities (Singapore) Ltd and GFI Group
	PTE Ltd; in Korea, BGC Capital Markets&nbsp;&amp; Foreign Exchange Broker (Korea) Limited and GFI Korea Money Brokerage Limited; and in Turkey, BGC Partners Menkul Degerler AS, all have net capital requirements imposed upon them by local regulators.
	In addition, the LCH (LIFFE/LME) clearing organization, of which BGC LP is a member, also imposes minimum capital requirements. In Latin America, BGC Liquidez Distribuidora De Titulos E Valores Mobiliarios Ltda. (Brazil) has net capital requirements
	imposed upon it by local regulators.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:8%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	In addition, these subsidiaries may be prohibited from repaying the borrowings of their parents or
	affiliates, paying cash dividends, making loans to their parent or affiliates or otherwise entering into transactions, in each case, that result in a significant reduction in their regulatory capital position without prior notification or approval
	from their principal regulator. See Note 22&#151;&#147;Regulatory Requirements,&#148; to our consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item&nbsp;8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, for further details on our regulatory requirements.

	As of December&nbsp;31, 2015, $510.1 million of net assets were held by regulated subsidiaries. As of December&nbsp;31, 2015, these

	In April 2013, our Board of Directors and Audit Committee authorized management to enter into indemnification agreements with Cantor and its
	affiliates with respect to the provision of any guarantees provided by Cantor and its affiliates from time to time as required by regulators. These services may be provided from time to time at a reasonable and customary fee.

	the European Securities and Markets Authority (&#147;ESMA&#148;) in September 2015 where implementation is now expected to commence in January 2018. MiFID II will have a particularly significant impact in a number of key areas, including corporate
	governance, transaction reporting, pre- and post-trade transparency, technology synchronization, best execution and investor protection. MiFID II will also introduce a new regulated execution venue category known as the Organized Trading Facility,
	and there is currently expected to be a joint equivalence assessment by EU and non-EU jurisdictions for granting mutual access to each&#146;s domestic marketplaces.

	Our Board of Directors and Audit Committee have authorized repurchases of our Class&nbsp;A common stock and redemptions of BGC
	Holdings limited partnership interests or other equity interests in our subsidiaries. In February 2014, our Audit Committee authorized such repurchases of stock or units from Cantor employees and partners. On October&nbsp;27, 2015, our Board of
	Directors and Audit Committee increased the Company&#146;s share repurchase and unit redemption authorization to $300 million, which may include purchases from Cantor, its partners or employees or other affiliated persons or entities. From time to
	time, we may actively continue to repurchase shares or redeem units. On February 23, 2016, we purchased from Cantor 5,000,000 shares of our Class A common stock at a price of $8.72 per share, the closing price on the date of the transaction. The
	transaction was included in our stock repurchase authorization. The transaction was approved by the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors. On February&nbsp;23, 2016, we purchased from The Cantor Fitzgerald Relief Fund 970,639 shares of our Class
	A common stock at a price of $8.72 per share, the closing price on the date of the transaction.

	common stock during the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2015. Approximately 6.9&nbsp;million of the 7.6&nbsp;million units above were redeemed using cash from our CEO program, and therefore did not impact the fully diluted number of shares and units

	At the end of the second quarter of 2013, we commenced a Global Partnership Restructuring Program, as a result of which we reduced our fully
	diluted share count by approximately 32&nbsp;million shares. In November 2013, we entered into the Ninth Amendment to the Agreement of Limited Partnership of the Partnership (see &#147;Ninth Amendment to Partnership Agreement&#148; herein), which
	created new preferred partnership units that may not be made exchangeable into our Class&nbsp;A common stock and are only entitled to a distribution each quarter at a rate of either 0.6875% (which is 2.75%&nbsp;per calendar year) or such other

	Amendment created five new classes of non-distributing partnership units (&#147;N Units&#148;), which are Working Partner Units. These new N Units carry the same name as the underlying unit with the insertion of an additional &#147;N&#148; to
	designate them as the N Unit type and are designated as NREUs, NPREUs, NLPUs, NPLPUs and NPPSUs. The N Units are not entitled to participate in Partnership distributions, will not be allocated any items of profit or loss and may not be made
	exchangeable into shares of the Company&#146;s Class&nbsp;A common stock. Subject to the approval of the Compensation Committee or its designee, N Units are expected to be converted into the underlying unit type (i.e. an NREU will be converted into
	an REU) and will then participate in Partnership distributions, subject to terms and conditions determined by the General Partner of the Partnership in its sole discretion, including that the recipient continue to provide substantial services to the
	Company and comply with his or her partnership obligations. The Eleventh Amendment was approved by the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors and by the full Board of Directors.

	Discretionary Bonus: A portion of our compensation and employee benefits expense is comprised of discretionary bonuses, which may be paid in
	cash, equity, partnership awards or a combination thereof. We accrue expense in a period based on revenues in that period and on the expected combination of cash, equity and partnership units. Given the assumptions used in estimating discretionary
	bonuses, actual results may differ.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:8%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Restricted Stock Units: We account for equity-based compensation under the fair value recognition
	provisions of the Financial Accounting Standards Board (&#147;FASB&#148;) guidance. Restricted stock units (&#147;RSUs&#148;) provided to certain employees are accounted for as equity awards, and as per FASB guidance, we are required to record an
	expense for the portion of the RSUs that is ultimately expected to vest. FASB guidance requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates.
	Because significant assumptions are used in estimating employee turnover and associated forfeiture rates, actual results may differ from our estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:8%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The fair value of RSU awards to employees is determined on the date of grant, based on the market value of our Class&nbsp;A common stock.
	Generally, RSUs granted by us as employee compensation do not receive dividend equivalents; as such, we adjust the fair value of the RSUs for the present value of expected forgone dividends, which requires us to include an estimate of expected
	dividends as a valuation input. This grant-date fair value is amortized to expense ratably over the awards&#146; vesting periods. For RSUs with graded vesting features, we have made an accounting policy election to recognize compensation cost on a
	straight-line basis. The amortization is reflected as non-cash equity-based compensation expense in our consolidated statements of operations.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:8%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Restricted Stock: Restricted stock provided to certain employees is accounted for as an equity award, and as per FASB guidance, we are
	required to record an expense for the portion of the restricted stock that is ultimately expected to vest. We have granted restricted stock that is not subject to continued employment or service; however, transferability is subject to compliance
	with our and our affiliates&#146; customary noncompete obligations. Such shares of restricted stock are generally saleable by partners in five to ten years. Because the restricted stock is not subject to continued employment or service, the
	grant-date fair value of the restricted stock is expensed on the date of grant. The expense is reflected as non-cash equity-based compensation expense in our consolidated statements of operations.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:8%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Limited Partnership Units: Limited partnership units in BGC Holdings are generally held by employees. Generally such units receive quarterly
	allocations of net income, which are cash distributed on a quarterly basis and generally contingent upon services being provided by the unit holders. As discussed above, our new Preferred Units are not entitled to participate in partnership
	distributions other than with respect to a distribution at a rate of either 0.6875% (which is 2.75%&nbsp;per calendar year) or such other amount as set forth in the award documentation. As prescribed in FASB guidance, the quarterly allocations of
	net income to such limited partnership units are reflected as a component of compensation expense under &#147;Allocation of net income and grants of exchangeability to limited partnership units and FPUs&#148; in our consolidated statements of
	operations.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:8%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Certain of these limited partnership units entitle the holders to receive post-termination payments equal to the notional
	amount in four equal yearly installments after the holder&#146;s termination. These limited partnership units are accounted for as post-termination liability awards under FASB guidance. Accordingly, we recognize a liability for these units on our
	consolidated statements of financial condition as part of &#147;Accrued compensation&#148; for the amortized portion of the post-termination payment amount, based on the current fair value of the expected future cash payout. We amortize the
	post-termination payment amount, less an expected forfeiture rate, over the vesting period, and record an expense for such awards based on the change in value at each reporting period in our consolidated statements of operations as part of
	&#147;Compensation and employee benefits.&#148;

	Certain limited partnership units are granted exchangeability into Class&nbsp;A common

	exchangeability to limited partnership units and FPUs&#148; in our consolidated statements of operations. During the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, we incurred compensation expense, before associated income taxes of $231.4
	million, $126.5 million and $57.0 million, respectively, related to the grant of exchangeability on partnership units. The 2015 amount includes a conversion of 90% of outstanding REUs and RPUs in December 2015 totaling $114.0&nbsp;million.

	Employee Loans: We have entered into various agreements with certain
	of our employees and partners whereby these individuals receive loans that may be either wholly or in part repaid from distributions that the individuals receive on some or all of their limited partnership interests or may be forgiven over a period
	of time. Cash advance distribution loans are documented in formal agreements and are repayable in timeframes outlined in the underlying agreements. We intend for these advances to be repaid in full from the future distributions on existing and
	future awards granted. The distributions are treated as compensation expense when made and the proceeds are used to repay the loan. The forgivable portion of any loans is recognized as compensation expense in our consolidated statements of
	operations over the life of the loan. We review the loan balances each reporting period for collectability. If we determine that the collectability of a portion of the loan balances is not expected, we recognize a reserve against the loan balances.

</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:8%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Goodwill
	is the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of identifiable net assets acquired in a business combination. As prescribed in FASB guidance, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, goodwill is not amortized, but instead is periodically
	tested for impairment. We review goodwill for impairment on an annual basis during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year or whenever an event occurs or circumstances change that could reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying
	amount.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:8%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	When reviewing goodwill for impairment, we first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that
	the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If the results of the qualitative assessment are not conclusive, or if we choose to bypass the qualitative assessment, we perform a goodwill impairment analysis using a two-step
	process.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:8%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The first step involves comparing each reporting unit&#146;s estimated fair value with its carrying value, including goodwill.
	To estimate the fair value of the reporting units, we use a discounted cash flow model and data regarding market comparables. The valuation process requires significant judgment and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions. These
	assumptions include cash flow projections, estimated cost of capital and the selection of peer companies and relevant multiples. Because significant assumptions and estimates are used in projecting future cash flows, choosing peer companies and
	selecting relevant multiples, actual results may differ from our estimates under different assumptions or conditions. If the estimated fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, goodwill is deemed not to be impaired. If the carrying
	value exceeds estimated fair value, there is an indication of potential impairment and the second step is performed to measure the amount of potential impairment.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:8%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The second step of the process involves the calculation of an implied fair value of goodwill for each reporting unit for which step one
	indicated a potential impairment may exist. The implied fair value of goodwill is determined by measuring the excess of the estimated fair value of the reporting unit as calculated in step one, over the estimated fair values of the individual
	assets, liabilities and identified intangibles. Events such as economic weakness, significant declines in operating results of reporting units, or significant changes to critical inputs of the goodwill impairment test (e.g., estimates of cash flows
	or cost of capital) could cause the estimated fair value of our reporting units to decline, which could result in an impairment of goodwill in the future.

</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:8%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	We
	account for income taxes using the asset and liability method as prescribed in FASB guidance on Accounting for Income Taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to basis differences between
	the consolidated financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis. Certain of our entities are taxed as U.S. partnerships and are subject to the Unincorporated Business Tax (&#147;UBT&#148;) in
	the City of New York. Therefore, the tax liability or benefit related to the partnership income or loss except for UBT rests with the partners (see Note 2&#151;&#147;Limited Partnership Interests in BGC Holdings&#148; for a discussion of partnership
	interests), rather than the partnership entity. As such, the partners&#146; tax liability or benefit is not reflected in our consolidated financial statements. The tax-related assets, liabilities, provisions or benefits included in our consolidated
	financial statements also reflect the results of the entities that are taxed as corporations, either in the U.S. or in foreign jurisdictions. Pursuant to FASB guidance on Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, an interpretation of FASB
	Statement on Accounting for Income Taxes, we provide for uncertain tax positions based upon management&#146;s assessment of whether a tax benefit is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by tax authorities. Management is required to
	determine whether a tax position is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by tax authorities, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits of the position. Because significant
	assumptions are used in determining whether a tax benefit is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by tax authorities, actual results may differ from our estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We recognize interest and
	penalties related to income tax matters in &#147;Interest expense&#148; and &#147;Other expenses,&#148; respectively, in our consolidated statement of operations.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:8%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	A valuation allowance is recorded against deferred tax assets if it is deemed more likely than not that those assets will not be realized. In
	assessing the need for a valuation allowance, we consider all available evidence, including past operating results, the existence of cumulative losses in the most recent fiscal years, estimates of future taxable income and the feasibility of tax
	planning strategies.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:8%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The measurement of current and deferred income tax assets and liabilities is based on provisions of enacted tax laws
	and involves uncertainties in the application of tax regulations in the U.S. and other tax jurisdictions. Because our interpretation of complex tax law may impact the measurement of current and deferred income taxes, actual results may differ from
	these estimates under different assumptions regarding the application of tax law.

	Credit risk arises from potential non-performance by counterparties and customers. BGC Partners has established policies and
	procedures to manage its exposure to credit risk. BGC Partners maintains a thorough credit approval process to limit exposure to counterparty risk and employs stringent monitoring to control the counterparty risk from its matched principal and
	agency businesses. BGC Partners&#146; account opening and counterparty approval process includes verification of key customer identification, anti-money laundering verification checks and a credit review of financial and operating data. The credit
	review process includes establishing an internal credit rating and any other information deemed necessary to make an informed credit decision, which may include correspondence, due diligence calls and a visit to the entity&#146;s premises, as
	necessary.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:8%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Credit approval is granted subject to certain trading limits and may be subject to additional conditions, such as the receipt
	of collateral or other credit support. Ongoing credit monitoring procedures include reviewing periodic financial statements and publicly available information on the client and collecting data from credit rating agencies, where available, to assess
	the ongoing financial condition of the client.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:8%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Through its subsidiaries, BGC Partners executes matched principal transactions in which it
	acts as a &#147;middleman&#148; by serving as counterparty to both a buyer and a seller in matching back-to-back trades. These transactions are then settled through a recognized settlement system or third-party clearing organization. Settlement
	typically occurs within one to three business days after the trade date. Cash settlement of the transaction occurs upon receipt or delivery of the underlying instrument that was traded. BGC Partners generally avoids settlement of principal
	transactions on a free-of-payment basis or by physical delivery of the underlying instrument. However, free-of-payment transactions may occur on a very limited basis.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:8%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The number of matched principal trades BGC Partners executes has continued to grow as compared to prior years. Receivables from
	broker-dealers, clearing organizations, customers and related broker-dealers and Payables to broker-dealers, clearing organizations, customers and related broker-dealers on the Company&#146;s consolidated statements of financial condition primarily
	represent the simultaneous purchase and sale of the securities associated with those matched principal transactions that have not settled as of their stated settlement dates. BGC Partners&#146; experience has been that substantially all of these
	transactions ultimately settle at the contracted amounts.

	In addition, BGC Partners incurs limited credit risk related to certain
	brokerage activities. The counterparty risk relates to the collectability of the outstanding brokerage fee receivables. The review process includes monitoring both the clients and the related brokerage receivables. The review includes an evaluation
	of the ongoing collection process and an aging analysis of the brokerage receivables.

	Market risk refers to the risk that a change in the level of one or more market prices, rates, indices or other factors will result in losses
	for a specified position. BGC Partners may allow certain of its desks to enter into unmatched principal transactions in the ordinary course of business and hold long and short inventory positions. These transactions are primarily for the purpose of
	facilitating clients&#146; execution needs, adding liquidity to a market or attracting additional order flow. As a result, BGC Partners may have market risk exposure on these transactions. BGC Partners&#146; exposure varies based on the size of its
	overall positions, the risk characteristics of the instruments held and the amount of time the positions are held before they are disposed of. BGC Partners has limited ability to track its exposure to market risk and unmatched positions on an
	intra-day basis; however, it attempts to mitigate its market risk on these positions by strict risk limits, extremely limited holding periods and hedging its exposure. These positions are intended to be held short term to facilitate customer
	transactions. However, due to a number of factors, including the nature of the position and access to the market on which it trades, BGC Partners may not be able to unwind the position and it may be forced to hold the position for a longer period
	than anticipated. All positions held longer than intra-day are marked to market.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:8%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	We also have investments in marketable equity
	securities, which are publicly-traded, and which had a fair value of $650.4&nbsp;million as of December&nbsp;31, 2015. These include the shares of common stock of NASDAQ that we received in exchange for a portion of our electronic benchmark Treasury
	platform and the shares of the common stock of ICE that we received in exchange for Trayport. Investments in marketable securities carry a degree of risk, as there can be no assurance that the marketable securities will not lose value and, in
	general, securities markets can be volatile and unpredictable. As a result of these different market risks, our holdings of marketable securities could be materially and adversely affected. We may seek to minimize the effect of price changes on a
	portion of our investments in marketable securities through the use of derivative contracts. However, there can be no assurance that our hedging activities will be adequate to protect us against price risks associated with our investments in
	marketable securities. See Note 10&#151;&#147;Marketable Securities&#148; and Note 12&#151;&#147;Derivatives&#148; to our consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item&nbsp;8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information regarding

	BGC Partners is exposed to risks associated with changes in foreign exchange rates. Changes in foreign exchange rates create volatility in the

	in the British Pound and Euro, including foreign currency hedge positions related to these currencies, we evaluated the effects of a 10% shift in exchange rates between those currencies and the U.S.&nbsp;Dollar, holding all other assumptions
	constant. The analysis identified the worst case scenario as both the Euro and British Pound strengthening against the U.S. Dollar. If as of December&nbsp;31, 2015, the Euro and British Pound had strengthened against the U.S.&nbsp;Dollar by 10%, the

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards
	require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the
	financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable

	We have audited BGC Partners, Inc.&#146;s (the &#147;Company&#148;) internal control over financial reporting as of December&nbsp;31, 2015, based on criteria

</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	We conducted our audit in
	accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial
	reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating
	effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	A company&#146;s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial
	reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company&#146;s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that
	(1)&nbsp;pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2)&nbsp;provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as
	necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors
	of the company; and (3)&nbsp;provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company&#146;s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of
	effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
</P>

	As indicated in the accompanying&nbsp;Management Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting, management&#146;s assessment of and conclusion on the
	effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting did not include the internal controls of Computerized Facility Integration, LLC and Excess Space Retail Services, Inc., which are included in the&nbsp;2015 consolidated financial statements
	of&nbsp;BGC Partners, Inc. and constituted&nbsp;$97.6 million or 2.5% of total assets as of&nbsp;December 31, 2015&nbsp;and&nbsp;$18.6&nbsp;million or 0.7%&nbsp;of revenues for the year then ended.&nbsp;Our audit of internal control over financial
	reporting of&nbsp;BGC Partners, Inc. also did not include an evaluation of the internal control over financial reporting of Computerized Facility Integration, LLC and Excess Space Retail Services, Inc. In our opinion, BGC Partners Inc. maintained,

	Certain of the limited partnership interests, described above, have been granted exchangeability into Class&nbsp;A common stock on a
	one-for-one basis (subject to adjustment); additional limited partnership interests may become exchangeable for Class&nbsp;A common stock on a one-for-one basis (subject to adjustment). Because they are included in the Company&#146;s fully diluted
	share count, if dilutive, any exchange of limited partnership interests into Class&nbsp;A common shares would not impact the fully diluted number of shares and units outstanding. Because these limited partnership interests generally receive
	quarterly allocations of net income, such exchange would have no significant impact on the cash flows or equity of the Company. Each quarter, net income is allocated between the limited partnership interests and the common stockholders. In quarterly
	periods in which the Company has a net loss, the loss allocation for FPUs, limited partnership units and Cantor units is allocated to Cantor and reflected as a component of &#147;Net income attributable to noncontrolling interest in
	subsidiaries&#148; in the Company&#146;s consolidated statements of operations. In subsequent quarters in which the Company has net income, the initial allocation of income to the limited partnership interests is to &#147;Net income attributable to
	noncontrolling interests in subsidiaries,&#148; to recover any losses taken in earlier quarters, with the remaining income allocated to the limited partnership interests. This income (loss) allocation process has no impact on the net income

	Fixed assets are carried at cost net of accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation is calculated on a straight-line basis over the
	estimated useful lives of the assets. Internal and external direct costs of developing applications and obtaining software for internal use are capitalized and amortized over three years on a straight-line basis. Computer equipment is depreciated
	over three to five years. Leasehold improvements are depreciated over the shorter of their estimated economic useful lives or the remaining lease term. Routine repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred. When fixed assets are retired or
	otherwise disposed of, the related gain or loss is included in operating income. The Company has asset retirement obligations related to certain of its leasehold improvements, which it accounts for using the FASB guidance, Accounting for Asset
	Retirement Obligations, which requires that the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation be recognized in the period in which it is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made. The associated asset retirement cost
	is capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the long-lived asset. The liability is discounted and accretion expense is recognized using the credit-adjusted risk-free interest rate in effect when the liability was initially recognized.

	impairment, the Company first assesses qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. The Company performed impairment evaluations for the years ended

	York City. Therefore, the tax liability or benefit related to the partnership income or loss except for UBT rests with the partners (see Note 2&#151; &#147;Limited Partnership Interests in BGC Holdings&#148; for a discussion of partnership
	interests), rather than the partnership entity. As such, the partners&#146; tax liability or benefit is not reflected in the Company&#146;s consolidated financial statements. The tax-related assets, liabilities, provisions or benefits included in
	the Company&#146;s consolidated financial statements also reflect the results of the entities that are taxed as corporations, either in the U.S. or in foreign jurisdictions. Pursuant to FASB guidance on Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, an
	interpretation of FASB Statement on Accounting for Income Taxes, the Company provides for uncertain tax positions based upon management&#146;s assessment of whether a tax benefit is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by tax

	43.0&nbsp;million new shares at that date&#146;s closing price of $5.81 per share, for an aggregate purchase price of $250 million. The purchase price was paid to GFI in the form of a note due on June&nbsp;19, 2018 that bears an interest rate of

	The following unaudited pro forma summary presents consolidated information of the Company as if the
	acquisition of GFI had occurred on January&nbsp;1, 2014, and as if the Company owns 100% of GFI from the date of acquisition. The unaudited pro forma results are not indicative of operations that would have been achieved, nor are they indicative of
	future results of operations. The unaudited pro forma results do not reflect any potential cost savings or other operations efficiencies that could result from the acquisition. In addition, the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial
	information does not include any adjustments in respect of certain expenses recorded in the GFI financial statements that were associated with non-recurring events unrelated to the acquisition (for example, a $121.6 million charge related to the
	impairment of goodwill) and does not include any adjustments in respect of any potential future sales of assets. However, the unaudited pro forma results below for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2015 do include non-recurring pro forma adjustments
	directly related to the acquisition which mainly consisted of: (a)&nbsp;Prior to the acquisition, GFI had entered into an agreement with the CME Group Inc. (&#147;CME&#148;) for CME to acquire GFI. The CME transaction was terminated and as a result,
	GFI incurred breakage costs of approximately $24.7 million; (b)&nbsp;Severance and compensation restructuring charges of $22.2 million incurred by GFI; (c)&nbsp;The aggregate of BGC&#146;s and GFI&#146;s professional fees incurred which totaled
	$24.9 million; and (d) The $29.0 million gain recorded by the Company upon acquisition of GFI on the 17.1 million shares of GFI common stock owned prior to the completion of the acquisition.

	&#147;Purchased Assets&#148; or &#147;eSpeed&#148;) to NASDAQ. Upon the sale of eSpeed, NASDAQ paid the Company $750 million in cash consideration, adjusted for certain pre-paid amounts and accrued costs and expenses. During the year ended
	December&nbsp;31, 2013, the Company recognized a gain of $723.1 million which was recorded in &#147;Gain on divestiture and sale of investments&#148; in the Company&#146;s consolidated statements of operations. An earn-out of up to 14,883,705 shares
	of NASDAQ common stock will be paid ratably in each of the fifteen years following the closing in which the consolidated gross revenue of NASDAQ is equal to or greater than $25 million. The earn-out was excluded from the initial gain on the
	divestiture and will be recognized in income when it is realized and earned (i.e., when the contingency is met), consistent with the accounting guidance for gain contingencies. During each of the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2015, 2014 and 2013,
	the Company received 992,247 shares of NASDAQ common stock and recognized gains of $68.0 million, $52.8 million and $39.5 million, respectively, related to the earn-out and related mark-to-market movements and/or hedging transactions which are
	included in &#147;Other income&#148; in the Company&#146;s consolidated statements of operations. As of December&nbsp;31, 2015, the Company holds approximately $112.5 million of NASDAQ shares which are included in &#147;Marketable securities&#148;

	Fully diluted EPS is calculated utilizing net income available for common stockholders plus net income
	allocations to the limited partnership interests in BGC Holdings, as well as adjustments related to the interest expense on the Convertible Notes, if applicable (see Note 18&#151;&#147;Notes Payable, Collateralized and Short-Term Borrowings&#148;),
	and expense related to dividend equivalents for certain RSUs, if applicable, as the numerator. The denominator is comprised of the Company&#146;s weighted-average outstanding shares of common stock and, if dilutive, the weighted-average number of
	limited partnership interests and other contracts to issue shares of common stock, including Convertible Notes, stock options and RSUs. The limited partnership interests generally are potentially exchangeable into shares of Class&nbsp;A common stock
	and are entitled to remaining earnings after the deduction for the Preferred Distribution; as a result, they are included in the fully diluted EPS computation to the extent that the effect would be dilutive.

	44.4&nbsp;million and 103.3&nbsp;million potentially dilutive securities were not included in the computation of fully diluted EPS because their effect would have been anti-dilutive. Anti-dilutive securities for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2015
	included, on a weighted-average basis, 56.8&nbsp;million limited partnership interests and 8.6&nbsp;million other securities or other contracts to issue shares of common stock. These 8.6&nbsp;million shares primarily represent the weighted-average
	of the 23.5&nbsp;million shares to be issued for the completion of the Company&#146;s acquisition of GFI. See Note 25&#151;&#147;Subsequent Events&#148; for more information on the completion of the Company&#146;s acquisition of GFI.

	The table above represents the gross unit redemptions and share repurchases of the Company&#146;s
	Class&nbsp;A common stock during the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2015. Approximately 6.9&nbsp;million of the 7.6&nbsp;million units above were redeemed using cash from the Company&#146;s CEO program, and therefore did not impact the fully diluted
	number of shares and units outstanding. The remaining redemptions along with the Class&nbsp;A common stock repurchases resulted in a 2.1&nbsp;million reduction in the fully diluted share count. This net reduction cost the Company approximately $18.1
	million (or $8.53 per share/unit) during the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2015. This reduction partially offset the overall growth in the fully diluted share count which resulted from acquisitions, equity based compensation and front office hires.

	Derivative contracts can be exchange-traded or OTC. Exchange-traded derivatives typically fall within
	Level 1 or Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy depending on whether they are deemed to be actively traded or not. The Company generally values exchange-traded derivatives using their closing prices. OTC derivatives are valued using market

	markets, such as generic forwards, swaps and options, model inputs can generally be verified and model selection does not involve significant management judgment. Such instruments are typically classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.

	As described in Note 18&#151;&#147;Notes Payable, Collateralized and Short-Term Borrowings,&#148; on
	July&nbsp;29, 2011, the Company issued an aggregate of $160.0 million principal amount of 4.50% Convertible Senior Notes due 2016 (the &#147;4.50% Convertible Notes&#148;) containing an embedded conversion feature. The conversion feature meets the
	requirements to be accounted for as an equity instrument, and the Company classifies the conversion feature within &#147;Additional paid-in capital&#148; in the Company&#146;s consolidated statements of financial condition. At the issuance of the
	4.50% Convertible Notes, the embedded conversion feature was measured at approximately $19.0 million on a pre-tax basis ($16.1 million net of taxes and issuance costs) as the difference between the proceeds received and the fair value of a similar
	liability without the conversion feature and is not subsequently remeasured.

	Also in connection with the issuance of the 4.50%
	Convertible Notes, the Company entered into capped call transactions. The capped call transactions meet the requirements to be accounted for as equity instruments, and the Company classifies the capped call transactions within &#147;Additional
	paid-in capital&#148; in the Company&#146;s consolidated statements of financial condition. The purchase price of the capped call transactions resulted in a decrease to &#147;Additional paid-in capital&#148; of $11.4 million on a pre-tax basis ($9.9
	million on an after-tax basis) at the issuance of the 4.50% Convertible Notes, and such capped call transactions are not subsequently remeasured.

	Through the acquisition of GFI, the Company is invested in a limited company that is focused on developing a proprietary trading business. The
	limited company is a VIE and it was determined that the Company is the primary beneficiary of this VIE because the Company, through GFI, was the provider of the majority of this VIE&#146;s start-up capital and has the power to direct the activities
	of this VIE that most significantly impact its economic performance, primarily through its voting percentage and consent rights on the activities that would most significantly influence the entity. The consolidated VIE had total assets of $9.5
	million at December&nbsp;31, 2015, which primarily consisted of clearing margin. There were no material restrictions on the consolidated VIE&#146;s assets. The consolidated VIE had total liabilities of $1.5 million at December&nbsp;31, 2015. The
	Company&#146;s exposure to economic loss on this VIE is approximately $5.8 million.

	The fair value of the 8.75% Convertible Notes was estimated based on a jump-diffusion convertible pricing
	model, which among other inputs incorporates the scheduled coupon and principal payments, the conversion feature inherent in the 8.75% Convertible Notes, the Company&#146;s Class&nbsp;A common stock price and a stock price volatility assumption. The
	stock price volatility assumptions are based on the historic volatility of the Company&#146;s Class&nbsp;A common stock. The fair value measurements of the 8.75% Convertible Notes are based on significant inputs observable in the market and are
	considered Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy. The fair values of the Senior Notes and 4.50% Convertible Notes were determined using observable market prices as these securities are traded and are considered Level 1 and Level 2, respectively,
	within the fair value hierarchy, based on whether they are deemed to be actively traded.

	On April&nbsp;1, 2010, BGC Holdings issued an aggregate of $150.0 million principal amount of the 8.75% Convertible Notes to Cantor in a
	private placement transaction. The Company used the proceeds of the 8.75% Convertible Notes to repay $150.0 million principal amount of Senior Notes that matured on April&nbsp;1, 2010. The 8.75% Convertible Notes were senior unsecured obligations
	and ranked equally and ratably with all existing and future senior unsecured obligations of the Company. The 8.75% Convertible Notes bore an annual interest rate of 8.75%, payable semi-annually in arrears on April&nbsp;15 and October&nbsp;15 of each
	year, beginning on October&nbsp;15, 2010. On April&nbsp;13, 2015, the Company&#146;s 8.75% Convertible Notes were fully converted into 24,042,599 shares of the Company&#146;s Class&nbsp;A common stock, par value $0.01 per share, and issued to Cantor
	Fitzgerald L.P. The Company recorded interest expense related to the 8.75% Convertible Notes of $3.8 million for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2015 and $13.1 million for the years ending December&nbsp;31, 2014 and 2013, respectively.

	On July&nbsp;29, 2011, the Company issued an aggregate of $160.0 million principal amount of 4.50% Convertible Notes due 2016. The 4.50%
	Convertible Notes are general senior unsecured obligations of the Company. The 4.50% Convertible Notes pay interest semiannually at a rate of 4.50%&nbsp;per annum and were priced at par. The 4.50% Convertible Notes will mature on July&nbsp;15, 2016,
	unless earlier repurchased, exchanged or converted. The Company recorded interest expense related to the 4.50% Convertible Notes of $12.0 million, $11.9 million and $11.7 million for the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2015, 2014 and 2013,

	As of December&nbsp;31, 2015, the 4.50% Convertible Notes were convertible, at the holder&#146;s option, at a conversion
	rate of 101.6260 shares of Class&nbsp;A common stock per $1,000 principal amount of notes, subject to adjustment in certain circumstances, including stock dividends and stock splits on the Class&nbsp;A common stock and the Company&#146;s payment of
	a quarterly cash dividend in excess of $0.17 per share of Class&nbsp;A common stock. Upon conversion, the Company will pay or deliver cash, shares of the Company&#146;s Class&nbsp;A common stock, or a combination thereof at the Company&#146;s
	election. As of December&nbsp;31, 2015, the 4.50% Convertible Notes were convertible into approximately 16.3&nbsp;million shares of Class&nbsp;A common stock.

	As prescribed by FASB guidance,
<I>
	Debt
</I>
	, the Company recognized the value of the embedded conversion feature of the 4.50% Convertible
	Notes as an increase to &#147;Additional paid-in capital&#148; of approximately $19.0 million on a pre-tax basis ($16.1 million net of taxes and issuance costs). The embedded conversion feature was measured as the difference between the proceeds
	received and the fair value of a similar liability without the conversion feature. The value of the conversion feature is treated as a debt discount and reduced the initial carrying value of the 4.50% Convertible Notes to $137.2 million, net of debt
	issuance costs of $3.8 million allocated to the debt component of the instrument. The discount is amortized as interest cost and the carrying value of the 4.50% Convertible Notes will accrete up to the face amount over the term of the 4.50%
	Convertible Notes.

	In connection with the offering of the 4.50% Convertible Notes, the Company entered into capped
	call transactions, which are expected to reduce the potential dilution of the Company&#146;s Class&nbsp;A common stock upon any conversion of the 4.50% Convertible Notes in the event that the market value per share of the Company&#146;s Class&nbsp;A
	common stock, as measured under the terms of the capped call transactions, is greater than the strike price of the capped call transactions ($10.78 as of December&nbsp;31, 2015, subject to adjustment in certain circumstances). The capped call
	transactions had a cap price equal to $13.48 per share as of December&nbsp;31, 2015. The purchase price of the capped call transactions resulted in a decrease to &#147;Additional paid-in capital&#148; of $11.4 million on a pre-tax basis ($9.9
	million on an after-tax basis). The capped call transactions cover approximately 14.8&nbsp;million shares of BGC&#146;s Class&nbsp;A common stock as of December&nbsp;31, 2015, subject to adjustment in certain circumstances.

	As part of the GFI acquisition, the Company assumed $240.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 8.375% Senior Notes (the &#147;8.375%
	Senior Notes&#148;) due July 2018. The carrying value of these notes as of December&nbsp;31, 2015 was $255.3 million. Interest on these notes is payable, semi-annually in arrears on the 19th of January and July. Due to the cumulative effect of
	downgrades to the credit rating of GFI&#146;s 8.375% Senior Notes, the 8.375% Senior Notes were subjected to 200 basis points penalty interest. On April&nbsp;28, 2015, a subsidiary of the Company purchased from GFI approximately 43.0&nbsp;million
	new shares of GFI common stock. This increased BGC&#146;s ownership to approximately 67% of GFI&#146;s outstanding common stock and gave us the ability to control the timing and process with respect to a full merger. Also on July&nbsp;10, 2015, the
	Company guaranteed the obligations of GFI under the 8.375% Senior Notes. These actions resulted in upgrades of the credit ratings of GFI&#146;s 8.375% Senior Notes by Moody&#146;s Investors Service, Fitch Ratings Inc. and Standard&nbsp;&amp;
	Poor&#146;s, which reduced the penalty interest to 25 basis points effective July&nbsp;19, 2015. In addition, on January&nbsp;13, 2016, Moody&#146;s further upgraded the credit rating on GFI&#146;s 8.375% Senior Notes, eliminating the penalty
	interest. The Company recorded interest expense related to the 8.375% Senior Notes of $19.2 million for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2015.

	As part of the acquisition of GFI, the Company now maintains a Deferred Cash Award Program which was adopted by GFI on February&nbsp;12, 2013,
	and provides for the grant of deferred cash incentive compensation to eligible employees. The Company may pay certain bonuses in the form of deferred cash compensation awards, which generally vest over a future service period. In addition, prior to
	the completion of the tender offer, GFI&#146;s outstanding RSUs were converted into the right to receive an amount in cash equal to $6.10 per unit, with such cash payable on and subject to the terms and conditions of the original vesting schedule of
	each RSU. The total compensation expense recognized in relation to the deferred cash compensation awards for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2015 was $23.1 million. As of December&nbsp;31, 2015, the total liability for the deferred cash
	compensation awards was $24.5 million, which is included in &#147;Accrued compensation&#148; on the Company&#146;s consolidated statements of financial condition. Total unrecognized compensation cost related to deferred cash compensation prior to
	the consideration of forfeitures, was approximately $32.3 million and is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 1.27 years.

	Cumulative undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries were approximately $325.8 million as of
	December&nbsp;31, 2015. Except for the cash proceeds from the sale of Trayport, it is our intention to permanently reinvest these undistributed foreign pre-tax earnings in the Company&#146;s foreign operations.&nbsp;It is not practicable to
	determine the amount of additional tax that may be payable in the event these earnings are repatriated due to the fluctuation of the relative ownership percentages of the foreign subsidiaries between the Company and BGC Holdings, L.P. With respect
	to the sale of Trayport, management concluded that the foreign proceeds attributable to the sale of Trayport in the amount of $603.9 million will ultimately be repatriated and will provide U.S. tax on those amounts.&nbsp;For these proceeds which are
	not permanently reinvested, the deferred tax liability for $135.5 million is net of foreign tax credits, which will be generated as a result of repatriation.&nbsp;In addition, certain GFI Group net operating loss carryforwards are expected to be
	utilized to reduce cash taxes.&nbsp;Taking these items together, we therefore expect to pay effective cash taxes of no more than $64 million related to the Trayport purchase price, or an expected rate of less than 10 percent.

	Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the consolidated
	financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those
	temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. A valuation allowance is recorded
	against deferred tax assets if it is deemed more likely than not that those assets will not be realized.

	Completion of Back-End Mergers with GFI Group

</B>
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:8%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	On January&nbsp;12, 2016, the Company, JPI, New JP Inc. (&#147;New JPI&#148;), Michael A. Gooch, Colin Heffron, and certain subsidiaries of JPI
	and the Company closed on a previously agreed upon merger. This merger provided for the acquisition of JPI by the Company as provided for by the merger agreement dated December&nbsp;22, 2015. Shortly following the completion of the JPI Merger, a
	subsidiary of the Company merged with and into GFI pursuant to a short-form merger under Delaware law, with GFI continuing as the surviving entity. The Back-End Mergers allowed the Company to acquire the remaining approximately 33 percent of the
	outstanding shares of GFI common stock that it did not already own. Following the closing of the Back-End Mergers, the Company and its affiliates now own 100 percent of the outstanding shares of GFI&#146;s common stock.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:8%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Under the terms of the merger agreement, certain subsidiaries of the Company merged with and into a subsidiary of New JPI, resulting in the
	Company owning all of the shares of GFI common stock previously owned by JPI. In the JPI Merger, each holder of JPI common stock, other than Messrs. Gooch and Heffron, received per JPI share held an amount equal to (a)&nbsp;$6.10 multiplied by the
	number of GFI shares held by JPI, less the principal plus accrued interest on the $10.75 million note issued by JPI to the Company on October&nbsp;6, 2015, divided by (b)&nbsp;the number of outstanding shares of New JPI common stock. This amount was
	paid 30 percent in cash and 70 percent in shares of BGC Class&nbsp;A common stock, valued at a price of $9.46 per share of BGC Class&nbsp;A common stock, which was the closing price of BGC Class&nbsp;A Common Stock on the day prior to the date of
	the Tender Offer Agreement, dated as of February&nbsp;19, 2015, by and among BGC, BGC Partners, L.P. and GFI. Messrs. Gooch and Heffron received the same amount per JPI share held, subject to certain adjustments, but were paid 100 percent in shares
	of BGC Class&nbsp;A common stock. In total, approximately 23.5&nbsp;million shares of BGC Class&nbsp;A common stock and $111.3 million in cash were issued or paid with respect to the closing of the Back-End Mergers, inclusive of adjustments. The
	total purchase consideration for all shares of GFI purchased by the Company was approximately $750 million, net of the $250.0 million note previously issued to GFI by the Company, which is eliminated in consolidation. The approximately $750 million
	purchase consideration excludes the $29.0 million gain recorded in the first quarter of 2015 with respect to the appreciation of the 17.1&nbsp;million shares of GFI held by the Company prior to the successful completion of the tender offer.
	Including this gain, the calculation of purchase consideration and noncontrolling interest totaled $779.5 million.

	On February 25, 2016, the Company entered into a committed unsecured credit agreement with Bank of America, N.A., as administrative agent, and
	a syndicate of lenders. Several of the Company&#146;s domestic non-regulated subsidiaries are parties to the credit agreement as guarantors. The credit agreement provides for maximum revolving loans of $150 million, with the option to increase the
	aggregate loans to $200 million. The maturity date of the facility is February&nbsp;25, 2018. Borrowings under this facility bear interest at either LIBOR or a defined base rate plus an additional margin which ranges from 50 basis points to 250
	basis points depending on the Company&#146;s debt rating as determined by S&amp;P and Fitch and whether such loan is a LIBOR loan or a base rate loan. Contemporaneously with the closing of this credit agreement, the $25 million unsecured credit
	agreement entered into on December&nbsp;24, 2015 with Bank of America, N.A. as lender was terminated. As of February&nbsp;29, 2016, there were no borrowings outstanding under either this $150 million facility or the terminated $25 million facility.

</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:13%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in
	Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f). Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chairman, Chief Executive Officer, and Chief Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our
	internal control over financial reporting as of December&nbsp;31, 2015 based upon criteria set forth in the Internal Control&#151;Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework)
	(COSO). Our internal control over financial reporting includes policies and procedures that provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external reporting purposes in
	accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:13%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Based on the results of our 2015 evaluation, our management concluded
	that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December&nbsp;31, 2015. We reviewed the results of management&#146;s assessment with our Audit Committee.

	Management has excluded BGC Partners&#146; acquisitions of Computerized Facility Integration, LLC (&#147;CFI&#148;) and Excess Space Retail
	Services, Inc. (&#147;Excess Space&#148;), as these acquisitions were completed during the course of 2015, and did not have a material effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows in 2015. However, we anticipate that these
	acquisitions will be included in management&#146;s assessment of internal control over financial reporting and our audit of internal controls over financial reporting for 2016. The aggregate 2015 GAAP revenues, recognized by CFI and Excess Space
	from the dates of acquisition, represented approximately 0.7% or $18.6 million of the Company&#146;s total GAAP revenues for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2015.

	increase to &#147;Additional paid-in capital&#148; of approximately $19.0 million on a pre-tax basis ($16.1 million net of taxes and issuance costs). The embedded conversion feature was measured as the difference between the proceeds received and
