	As a company incorporated under the laws of The Netherlands, we have listed our securities for
	trading on the Australian Securities Exchange, or ASX, through the use of the Clearing House
	Electronic Subregister System, or CHESS, via CHESS Units of Foreign Securities, or CUFS. CUFS are a
	form of depositary security that represents a beneficial ownership interest in the securities of a
	non-Australian corporation. Each of our CUFS represents the beneficial ownership of one share of
	common stock of JHI NV, the legal ownership of which is held by CHESS Depositary Nominees Pty Ltd.
	The CUFS are listed and traded on the ASX under the symbol &#147;JHX.&#148;

	We have also listed our securities for trading on the New York Stock Exchange, or NYSE. We sponsor
	a program, whereby beneficial ownership of five CUFS is represented by one American Depositary
	Share, or ADS, which is issued by The Bank of New York. These ADSs trade on the NYSE in the form of
	American Depositary Receipts, or ADRs, under the symbol &#147;JHX.&#148; Unless the context indicates
	otherwise, when we refer to ADSs, we are referring to ADRs or ADSs and when we refer to our common
	stock we are referring to the shares of our common stock that are represented by CUFS.

	EBITDA is not a measure of financial performance under U.S. GAAP and should not be
	considered an alternative to, or more meaningful than, income from operations, net income or
	cash flows as defined by U.S. GAAP or as a measure of our profitability or liquidity. Not
	all companies calculate EBITDA in the same manner as we have and, accordingly, EBITDA may
	not be comparable with other companies. We have included information concerning EBITDA
	because we believe that this data is commonly used by investors to evaluate the ability of a
	company&#146;s earnings from its core business operations to satisfy its debt, capital
	expenditure and working capital requirements. To permit evaluation of this data on a
	consistent basis from period to period, EBITDA has been adjusted for noncash charges, as
	well as non-operating income and expense items.

	Our wholly owned Australian subsidiary, James Hardie 117 Pty Ltd (which we refer to as the

	On November&nbsp;21, 2006, JHI NV, the AICF, the Government of the State of New South Wales, Australia
	(which we refer to as the NSW Government) and the Performing Subsidiary entered into an amended and
	restated Final Funding Agreement (which we refer to as the Amended FFA) to provide long-term
	funding to the AICF, a special purpose fund that provides compensation for Australian
	asbestos-related personal injury and death claims for which certain former companies of the James
	Hardie Group, including ABN 60 Pty Limited (which we refer to as ABN 60), Amaca Pty Ltd (which we
	refer to as Amaca) and Amaba Pty Ltd (which we refer to as Amaba) (collectively, the Former James
	Hardie Companies) are found liable.

<DIV ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT; MARGIN-TOP: 6PT">
	We have recorded an asbestos liability of $1.3&nbsp;billion in our consolidated financial statements as
	of March&nbsp;31, 2009, relating to our anticipated future payments to the AICF pursuant to the Amended
	FFA. The initial funding contribution of A$184.3&nbsp;million ($145.0&nbsp;million at the time of payment)
	was made to the AICF in February&nbsp;2007. No contribution was required to be made under the Amended
	FFA in fiscal year 2008. Further contributions were made on a quarterly basis in July and October
	2008 and in January and March&nbsp;2009, totaling A$118.0&nbsp;million (inclusive of interest). Under the
	terms of the Amended FFA, we are not required to make a contribution to the AICF in fiscal year
	2010. Future funding for the AICF continues to be linked under the terms of the Amended FFA to our
	long-term financial success, especially our ability to generate net operating cash flow.
</DIV>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT; MARGIN-TOP: 6PT">
	As a result of our obligation to make payments under the Amended FFA, our funds available for
	capital expenditures (either with respect to our existing business or new business opportunities),
	repayments of debt, payments of dividends or other distributions have been, and will be, reduced by
	the funding paid to the AICF, and consequently, our financial position, liquidity, results of
	operations and cash flows have been, and will be, reduced or materially adversely affected. Our

	Potential escalation in proven claims made against, and associated costs of, the AICF could
	increase our annual funding payments required to be made under the Amended FFA, which may cause us
	to have to increase our asbestos liability in the future.
</I>
</B>
</DIV>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT; MARGIN-TOP: 6PT">
	The amount of our asbestos liability is based, in part, on actuarially determined, anticipated
	(estimated), future annual funding payments to be made to the AICF on an undiscounted and
	uninflated basis. Future annual payments to the AICF are based on updated actuarial assessments
	that are to be performed as of March&nbsp;31 of each year to determine expected asbestos-related
	personal injury and death claims to be funded under the Amended FFA for the financial year in which
	the payment is made and the next two financial years. Estimates of actuarial liabilities are based
	on many assumptions, which may not prove to be correct, and which are subject to considerable
	uncertainty, since the ultimate number and cost of claims are subject to the outcome of events that
	have not yet occurred, including social, legal and medical developments as well as future economic
	conditions.
</DIV>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT; MARGIN-TOP: 6PT">
	For instance, it is possible that the categories of payable claims could be extended to include
	claims that are not presently compensable or legally recognized. Further, estimating the future
	extent and pattern of asbestos-related diseases that will arise from past exposure to asbestos and
	the proportion of those claims that will be successful is inherently difficult and therefore could
	materially differ from actual results. In addition, particularly during times of credit market
	downturns, the investments of the AICF could decline in value, as we experienced in fiscal year
	2009.
</DIV>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT; MARGIN-TOP: 6PT">
	If future proven claims are more numerous, the liabilities arising from them are larger than that
	currently estimated by our actuary (currently KPMG Actuaries Pty Ltd (which we refer to as KPMG
	Actuaries)) or if the AICF investments decline in value, it is possible that pursuant to the terms
	of the Amended FFA, we will be required to pay higher annual funding payments to the AICF than
	currently anticipated and on which our asbestos liability is based. If this occurs, we may be
	required to increase our asbestos liability which would be reflected as a charge in our
	consolidated statements of operations at that date. Any such changes to actuarial estimates which
	require us to increase our asbestos liability could have a material adverse effect on our financial
	position, liquidity, results of operations and cash flows.

	Even though the Amended FFA has been implemented, we may be subject to potential additional
	liabilities (including claims for compensation or property remediation outside the arrangements

	Group previously manufactured products that contained asbestos.
</I>
</B>
</DIV>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT; MARGIN-TOP: 6PT">
	Up to 1987, two former subsidiaries of ABN 60, Amaca and Amaba, which are now owned and controlled
	by the AICF, manufactured products in Australia that contained asbestos. In addition, prior to
	1937, ABN 60, which is also now owned and controlled by the AICF, manufactured products in
	Australia that contained asbestos. ABN 60 also held shares in companies that manufactured
	asbestos-containing products in Indonesia and Malaysia, and held minority shareholdings in
	companies that conducted asbestos-mining operations based in Canada and Southern Africa. Former ABN
	60 subsidiaries also exported asbestos-containing products to various countries. The AICF is
	designed to provide compensation only for certain claims and to meet certain related expenses and
	liabilities, and the legislation introduced in New South Wales in connection with the Amended FFA
	seeks to defer all other claims against the Former James Hardie Companies. The funds contributed to
	the AICF will not be available to meet any asbestos-related claims made outside Australia, or
	claims made arising from exposure to asbestos occurring outside Australia, or any claim for pure
	property loss or pure economic loss or remediation of property. In these circumstances, it is
	possible that persons with such excluded claims may seek to pursue those claims directly against
	us. Defending any such litigation could be costly and time consuming, and consequently, our
	financial position, liquidity, results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely

	Prior to 1988, a New Zealand subsidiary in the James Hardie Group manufactured products in New
	Zealand that contained asbestos. In New Zealand, asbestos-related disease compensation claims are
	managed by the state-run Accident Compensation Corporation (which we refer to as the ACC). Our New
	Zealand subsidiary that manufactured products that contained asbestos contributed financially to
	the ACC fund as required by law via payment of an annual levy while it carried on business. All
	decisions relating to the amount and allocation of payments to claimants in New Zealand are made by
	the ACC in accordance with New Zealand law. The Injury Prevention, Rehabilitation and Compensation
	Act 2001 (NZ)&nbsp;bars compensatory damages for claims that are covered by the legislation which may be
	made against the ACC fund. However, we may be subject to potential liability if any of these claims
	are found not to be covered by the legislation and are later brought against us, and consequently,
	our financial position, liquidity, results of operations and cash flows could be materially
	adversely affected.
</DIV>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT; MARGIN-TOP: 6PT">
	Apart from the funding obligations arising out of the Amended FFA, it is possible that we could
	become subject to suits for damages for personal injury or death in connection with the former
	manufacture or sale of asbestos products that have been or may be filed against the Former James
	Hardie Companies. Although the ability of any claimants to initiate or pursue such suits is
	restricted by the legislation enacted by the NSW Government under the terms of the Amended FFA (see
	Item&nbsp;4, &#147;Information on the Company &#151; Commitment to Provide Funding on a Long-Term Basis in
	Respect of Asbestos-Related Liabilities of Former Subsidiaries&#148;), we cannot predict with any
	certainty the outcome of any future claims or allegations that may be made, how the laws of various
	jurisdictions may be applied to the facts or how the laws may change in the future. If a court of
	competent jurisdiction relying on applicable law at the time were to find JHI NV or another James
	Hardie Group subsidiary liable for damages connected with existing or former subsidiaries for their
	past manufacture of asbestos-containing products, we may incur material liabilities in connection
	with any damages that may be awarded in the legal proceedings, in addition to the costs associated
	with defending against such claims. Any such additional liabilities could have a material adverse

	Because our revenues are primarily derived from sales in U.S. dollars and payments pursuant to the
	Amended FFA are made in Australian dollars, we may experience unpredictable volatility in our
	reported results due to changes in the U.S. dollar (and other currencies from which we derive our
	sales) compared to the Australian dollar.
</I>
</B>
</DIV>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT; MARGIN-TOP: 6PT">
	Approximately 16% and 14% of our net sales in fiscal years 2009 and 2008, respectively, were
	derived from sales in Australia. Payments pursuant to the Amended FFA are required to be made to
	the AICF in Australian dollars. In addition, annual payments to the AICF are calculated based on
	various estimates that are denominated in Australian dollars. To the extent that our future
	obligations exceed our Australian dollar cash flows, and we do not hedge this foreign exchange
	exposure, we will need to convert U.S. dollars or other foreign currency into Australian dollars in
	order to meet our obligations pursuant to the Amended FFA. As a result, any unfavorable
	fluctuations in the U.S. dollar (the majority of our revenues is derived from sales in U.S.
	dollars) and other currencies from which we derive our sales compared to the Australian dollar will
	require us to convert more U.S. dollars and other currencies from which we derive our sales to pay
	the same amount of Australian dollar denominated annual payments to the AICF.
</DIV>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT; MARGIN-TOP: 6PT">
	In addition, because our results of operations are reported in U.S. dollars and the asbestos
	liability is based on estimated payments denominated in Australian dollars, unfavorable
	fluctuations in the U.S. dollar compared to the Australian dollar may materially affect our
	reported results of operations since we will be required to expense any such fluctuations in the
	reported period in order to increase the reported value of the asbestos liability on our balance
	sheet.
</DIV>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT; MARGIN-TOP: 6PT">
	Due to the size of the asbestos liability recorded on our balance sheet, fluctuations in the
	exchange rate will cause unpredictable volatility in our reported results for the foreseeable
	future. For example, during fiscal years 2009 and 2008, we recorded a favorable impact of $179.7
	million and an unfavorable impact of $87.2&nbsp;million, respectively, due to fluctuations in the U.S.
	dollar compared to the Australian dollar. Any unfavorable fluctuation in U.S. dollar and the other
	currencies from which we derive our sales compared to the Australian dollar could have a material
	adverse effect on our financial position, liquidity, results of operations and cash flows. See Item

	Under the Amended FFA, we are also subject to certain non-monetary obligations that could prove

	the Performing Subsidiary, in each case such that we and the Performing Subsidiary would cease to

	had the relevant transaction not occurred. Those restrictions apply to dividends and other
	distributions, reorganizations of, or dealings in, share capital which create or vest rights in
	such capital in third parties, or non-arm&#146;s length transactions. While the Amended FFA contains
	certain exemptions from such restrictions (including, for example, exemptions for arm&#146;s length

	On December&nbsp;28, 2004, the United States and The Netherlands amended the U.S.-Netherlands Income Tax
	Treaty (prior to amendment, the &#147;Original U.S.-NL Treaty&#148;; post amendment, the &#147;New U.S.-NL
	Treaty&#148;). We believe that, based on the transitional rules set forth in the New U.S.-NL Treaty, the
	Original U.S.-NL Treaty applied to us and to our Dutch and U.S. subsidiaries until January&nbsp;31,
	2006. We believe that, under the LOB provision of the Original U.S.-NL Treaty, a 5% U.S.
	withholding tax applied to dividends, and no U.S. withholding tax applied to interest or royalties
	that our U.S. subsidiaries paid to JHI NV or our Dutch finance subsidiary. The LOB provision of the
	Original U.S.-NL Treaty had various conditions of eligibility for reduced U.S. withholding tax
	rates and other treaty benefits, all of which we satisfied. If, however, we do not qualify for
	benefits under the New U.S.-NL Treaty, those dividend, interest and royalty payments would be
	subject to a 30% U.S. withholding tax.

<DIV ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT; MARGIN-TOP: 6PT">
	Companies eligible for benefits under the New U.S.-NL Treaty qualify for a zero percent U.S.

	dividends. However, the LOB provision of the New U.S.-NL Treaty has a number of new, more
	restrictive eligibility requirements for eliminating or reducing U.S. withholding taxes and for
	other treaty benefits. We changed our organizational and operational structure as of January&nbsp;1,
	2006 to satisfy the requirements of the LOB provision of the New U.S.-NL Treaty and believe we are

	applying from early 2006. However, on April&nbsp;15, 2009, we announced that the Appeals Division of the
	IRS had entered into a settlement agreement with our subsidiaries in which the IRS agreed to
	concede the government&#146;s position in full with regard to its assertion that we did not qualify for
	benefits under the New U.S.-NL Treaty for calendar years 2006 and 2007. The IRS has concluded that,
	for those years, we are entitled to reduced withholding tax rates under the LOB provision of the

	tax audit or related process, the IRS determines that we are not eligible for continuing benefits
	under the U.S.- NL Tax Treaty, we may not qualify for treaty benefits. As a result, our effective

	We have concentrated our finance and treasury activities in our Dutch finance subsidiary located in
	The Netherlands. In addition to providing financing to our various subsidiaries, the finance
	subsidiary owns and develops intellectual property that it licenses to our operating subsidiaries.
	Under the Dutch International Group Finance Company rules, we have obtained a ruling from the Dutch
	Revenue authority that allows the finance subsidiary to set aside, in a Financial Risk Reserve
	(which we refer to as FRR), a portion of its taxable profits from its financing activity and from
	licensing its intellectual property. The amounts set aside in the FRR are free of current Dutch
	income tax. Consequently, the finance subsidiary will generally incur an effective tax rate of
	approximately 13% to 15% on its qualifying financing and licensing income and is taxable at the
	25.5% statutory rate on all other income received (25.5% is the Dutch statutory rate for calendar
	year 2007 and subsequent years). Such other income includes any amounts involuntarily released from
	the FRR to cover any risks (such as currency losses, bad debt losses and foreign branch losses) for
	which the FRR was established. The effective tax rate on qualifying income may be reduced to as low
	as approximately 5% to 7% depending on the extent to which amounts from the FRR pay for qualifying
	capital contributions that are used to finance capital and other certain qualifying expenditures
	and result in a tax exempt release from the FRR. However, the effective tax rate may also be higher
	than 13% to 15% if (1)&nbsp;the risks for which the FRR was formed materialize or (2)&nbsp;if there are
	insufficient opportunities to obtain tax exempt releases from the FRR. The Dutch revenue ruling
	became effective on July&nbsp;1, 2001 and, when issued, was to apply for 10&nbsp;years so long as we satisfy
	the requirements of the Dutch International Group Finance Company provisions under Dutch tax law.

	Any slow down in the markets we serve could result in decreased demand for our products and cause
	us to experience decreased sales and operating income. In addition, the level of activity in
	construction markets also depends on our ability to grow primary demand for fiber cement and
	convert sales of alternative materials to sales of fiber cement. Historically, in periods of
	economic decline, both new housing starts and residential remodeling also decline. The level of
	activity in the commercial construction market depends largely on vacancy rates and general
	economic conditions. Because residential and commercial construction markets are sensitive to
	cyclical changes in the economy, downturns in the economy or a lack of substantial improvement in
	the economy of any of our geographic markets could materially adversely affect our financial
	position, liquidity, results of operations and cash flows. In addition, during periods of economic
	decline, we may have difficulty retaining our workforce which may, in turn, lead to additional
	costs such as the costs of deferred bonus programs and the training of new workers.

<DIV ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT; MARGIN-TOP: 6PT">
	Some of our competitors have lowered prices of their products to compete for sales. In addition, we
	expect our competitors to continue to expand their manufacturing capacities, to improve the design
	and performance of their products and to introduce new products with competitive price and

</DIV>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT; MARGIN-TOP: 6PT">
	Fiber cement product prices in the United States, Australia and New Zealand have fluctuated for a
	number of years due to the entry into the market of new producers and competition from alternative

	Cellulose fiber, silica, cement and water are the principal raw materials used in the production of
	fiber cement. Our fiber cement business periodically experiences fluctuations in the supply and
	costs of raw materials, and some of our supply markets are concentrated. For example, during fiscal
	year 2008 in the United States, pulp prices rose by 11% due to tight global supply and low
	inventory levels. Also, as pulp is globally traded in U.S. dollars, changes in the value of the
	U.S. dollar will result in fluctuations in global pulp prices. Market pulp prices have been
	declining since the third quarter of fiscal year 2009, driven by the weakened global economy and
	relative strengthening of the U.S. dollar compared to the Euro, Canadian Dollar and other
	currencies. The market price for pulp in North America was down by 5% in fiscal year 2009. In
	fiscal year 2008, strong increases in energy related costs including coal, diesel and electricity
	also adversely impacted materials which have a high energy cost component, including cement and
	quarrying products such as silica. The price we paid for cement increased by 3% in fiscal year 2008
	and decreased by 5% in fiscal year 2009. Price fluctuations or material delays may occur in the
	future due to lack of raw materials or suppliers. The loss or deterioration of our relationship
	with a major supplier, an increase in demand by third parties for a particular supplier&#146;s products
	or materials or delays in obtaining materials could have a material adverse effect on our financial

	James Hardie N.V. (which we refer to as JHNV) was incorporated in August&nbsp;1998 as an intermediary

	16, 1998, the shareholders of ABN&nbsp;60 approved the 1998 Reorganization. We began our restructuring

	financial and commercial issues associated with the increasing significance and growth
	opportunities of our U.S. operations and the location of corporate management and our shareholder

	our annual net operating cash flow, including reductions for our contributions to the AICF and tax
	payments. These payments to the AICF will result in us having a pecuniary interest in the AICF. The

	General Overview of Our Business
</B>
</DIV>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT; MARGIN-TOP: 6PT">
	Based on net sales, we believe we are the largest manufacturer of fiber cement products and systems
	for internal and external building construction applications in the United States, Australia, New
	Zealand, and the Philippines. Fiber cement has been one of the fastest growing segments (in terms
	of market growth) of the U.S. residential exteriors industry for the past three years according to
	NAHB&#146;s Builder Practices Reports &#150; Siding Usage/Exterior Wall Finish In New Construction and
	Consumer Practices Reports &#150; Siding Usage/Exterior Wall Finish In Repair &#038; Remodel (which we refer
	to as the NAHB&#146;s Builder Practices Reports). Based on our knowledge, experience and third-party
	data regarding our industry, we estimate that the total U.S. industry shipments of fiber cement
	siding was between 0.94 and 0.98&nbsp;billion square feet during fiscal year 2009, a decrease of
	approximately 23 to 26% from fiscal year 2008. Based on our knowledge, experience and third-party
	data, we estimate that we have 30 to 40% of the U.S. backerboard market. We market our fiber cement
	products and systems under various Hardie brand names and other brand names such as Artisan

	siding). We believe that, in certain applications, our fiber cement products
	and systems provide a combination of distinctive performance, design and cost advantages when
	compared to other fiber cement products and alternative products and systems that use solid wood,
	engineered wood, vinyl, brick, stucco or gypsum wallboard. The sale of fiber cement products in the
	United States accounted for 77%, 78% and 82% of our total net sales from continuing operations in
	fiscal years 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively.
</DIV>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT; MARGIN-TOP: 6PT">
	Our fiber cement products are used in a number of markets, including new residential construction
	(single and multi-family housing), manufactured housing (mobile and pre-fabricated homes), repair
	and remodeling and a variety of commercial and industrial applications (stores, warehouses,
	offices, hotels, motels, schools, libraries, museums, dormitories, hospitals, detention facilities,
	religious buildings and gymnasiums). We manufacture numerous types of fiber cement products with a
	variety of patterned profiles and surface finishes for a range of applications, including external
	siding and soffit lining, internal linings, facades, fencing and floor and tile underlayments.
</DIV>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT; MARGIN-TOP: 6PT">
	In contrast to some other building materials, fiber cement provides durability attributes, such as
	strong resistance to moisture, fire, impact and termites, requires relatively little maintenance
	and can be used as a substrate to create a wide variety of architectural effects with textured and
	colored finishes. Based on our knowledge, experience and third-party data regarding our industry,
	we estimate that, in fiscal year 2009, we sold approximately 12%

	U.S. Housing Industry and Fiber Cement Industry
</I>
</DIV>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT; MARGIN-TOP: 6PT">
	In the United States, fiber cement is principally used in the residential building industry. Such
	usage fluctuates based on the level of new home construction and the repair and remodeling of
	existing homes. The level of activity is generally a function of interest rates and the
	availability of finance to homeowners to purchase a new home or make improvements to their existing
	homes, inflation, unemployment levels, demographic trends, gross domestic product growth and
	consumer confidence. Demand for building products is also affected by residential housing starts
	and existing home sales, the age and size of the housing stock and overall home improvement
	expenditures. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, annual domestic housing starts decreased from
	approximately 1.35&nbsp;million in calendar year 2007 to approximately 905.5 thousand in calendar year
	2008. Based on our knowledge, experience and third-party data regarding our industry, we estimate
	that total U.S. industry shipments of fiber cement siding was between 0.94 and 0.98&nbsp;billion square
	feet during fiscal year 2009, a decrease of approximately 23 to 26% from fiscal year 2008. The
	future growth of fiber cement products will depend on overall demand for building products and on
	the rate of penetration of fiber cement products against competing materials such as wood,
	engineered wood (hardboard and oriented strand board), vinyl, masonry and stucco. See Item&nbsp;3, &#147;Key
	Information &#151; Risk Factors.&#148;
</DIV>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT; MARGIN-TOP: 6PT">
	In the United States, the largest application for fiber cement products is in the external siding
	industry. Based on the NAHB&#146;s Builder Practices Reports, for the past three years, fiber cement has
	been one of the fastest growing segments (in terms of market growth) of the siding industry. Siding
	is a component of every building and it usually occupies more square footage than any other
	building component, such as windows and doors. Selection of siding material is based on installed
	cost, durability, aesthetic appeal, strength, weather resistance, maintenance requirements and
	cost, insulating properties and other features. Different regions of the United States show a
	decided preference among siding materials according to economic conditions, weather, materials
	availability and local taste. The principal siding materials are vinyl, stucco, fiber cement, solid
	wood, and brick. Vinyl has the largest share of the siding market. In recent years, based on the
	NAHB&#146;s Builder Practices Reports, fiber cement has been gaining market share against vinyl and
	wood, and this is believed to be due to a number of reasons, including aesthetics, durability
	concerns and lower maintenance requirements compared to wood.

	International Fiber Cement Industry
</I>
</DIV>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT; MARGIN-TOP: 6PT">
	In Australia and New Zealand, fiber cement building products are used in both the residential and
	commercial building industries with applications in external siding, internal walls, ceilings,
	floors, soffits and fences. The residential building industry represents the principal market for
	fiber cement products. We believe the level of activity in this industry is generally a function of
	interest rates, inflation, unemployment levels, demographic trends, gross domestic product
	growth and consumer confidence. Demand for fiber cement building products is
	also affected by the level of new housing starts and renovation activity. According to the
	Australian Bureau of Statistics (which we refer to as the ABS) total dwelling commencements in
	Australia declined from 151,978 in calendar year 2005 to 151,414 in calendar year 2008. Renovation
	activity, as measured in local currency expenditures by the ABS has increased from calendar year
	2005 to calendar year 2008 for a total increase over this period of approximately 15.5%. According
	to Statistics New Zealand, new dwellings authorized in New Zealand declined from approximately
	26,023 in calendar year 2005 to 18,456 in calendar year 2008. Residential renovation activity in
	New Zealand has increased from calendar year 2005 to calendar year 2008 for a total increase over
	this period of approximately 10%. The Housing Industry Association of Australia expects the decline
	in new housing construction renovation activity to continue through mid-2009 and to start a steady
	recovery while InfoMetrics New Zealand believes new housing construction and renovation activity
	are expected to soften over the short-to-medium term in New Zealand.

<DIV ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT; MARGIN-TOP: 6PT">
	Fiber cement products have, across a range of product applications, gained broader acceptance in
	Australia and New Zealand than in the United States, primarily due to earlier introduction in
	Australia and New Zealand. Former subsidiaries of ABN 60 developed fiber cement in Australia as a
	replacement for asbestos cement in the early 1980s. Asbestos sheet production ceased in the early
	1980s and asbestos pipe production ceased in early 1987. Competition has intensified over the past
	decade in Australia. In addition to competition from solid wood, engineered wood, wallboard,
	masonry and brick, two Australian competitors have established fiber cement manufacturing
	facilities in Australia and fiber cement imports are also growing. Competition continues to
	intensify in New Zealand as fiber cement imports have become more cost competitive and overseas
	manufacturers struggling with the global recession look for additional markets to their existing
	ones. See Item&nbsp;3, &#147;Key Information &#151; Risk Factors.&#148;
</DIV>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT; MARGIN-TOP: 6PT">
	In the Philippines and other Asian and Middle East (Israel, Kuwait, Qatar and the United Arab
	Emirates) markets, fiber cement building products are used in both the residential and commercial
	building industries with applications in external siding, external facades, internal walls,
	ceilings, floors, and soffits. The residential building industry represents the principal market
	for fiber cement products. In general, fiber cement products have, across a range of product
	applications, gained broader acceptance in these regions over the last 10&nbsp;years. However, in some
	of the developing markets, gypsum usage has increased and penetrated into fiber cement
	applications. Fiber cement and asbestos cement facilities are located throughout Asia and exporting
	between countries is common practice. Management believes that fiber cement has good long-term
	growth potential because of the benefits of light-weight and framed construction over traditional
	masonry construction. In addition, we believe the opportunity to replace wood-based products, such
	as plywood, with more durable fiber cement will be attractive to some consumers in some of these
	markets.
</DIV>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT; MARGIN-TOP: 6PT">
	In Europe, fiber cement building products are used in both residential and commercial building
	industries with applications in external siding, internal walls, floors, soffits and roofing. We
	compete in most segments except roofing and promote the use of fiber cement products against
	traditional masonry, gypsum based products and wood based products. Since we commenced selling our
	products in Europe in fiscal year 2004, we have continued to work to grow demand for our products
	by building awareness among distributors, builders and contractors. Management believes that the
	growth outlook for fiber cement in Europe is favorable in light of stricter insulation requirements
	driving demand for advanced cladding systems and better building practices increasing the use of
	fiber cement in interior applications.

	We manufacture fiber cement products in the United States, Australia, New Zealand and the
	Philippines. In July&nbsp;2005, we sold our Chilean fiber cement business. In fiscal year 2004, we
	commenced our European fiber cement business by distributing our fiber cement products in the
	United Kingdom and France. We also manufacture fiber cement pipes in Australia and previously
	manufactured fiber cement pipes in the United States. In May&nbsp;2008, we ceased operation of our pipe
	business in the United States. Our total product offering is aimed at the building and construction
	markets, including new residential construction, manufactured housing, repair and remodeling and a
	variety of commercial and industrial building applications.

<DIV ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT; MARGIN-TOP: 6PT">
	We offer a wide range of fiber cement products for both exterior and interior applications, some of
	which have not yet been introduced into the United States. In the United States and elsewhere, our
	products are typically sold as planks or flat sheets with a variety of patterned profiles and
	finishes. Planks are used for external siding while flat sheets are used for internal and external wall linings and floor and tile underlayments. Outside
	the United States, we also manufacture fiber cement products for use in other applications such as
	building facades, lattice, fencing, decorative columns, flooring, soffit lining and ceiling
	applications.

	We have developed a proprietary technology platform that enables us to produce thicker yet
	lighter-weight fiber cement products that are generally lighter and easier to handle than
	traditional building products. The first application of this technology has been our
	Hardietrim
<SUP STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 85%; VERTICAL-ALIGN: TEXT-TOP">
	&#174;
</SUP>
	board. Hardietrim board is a fiber cement trim product that is used on the
	exterior of residential and commercial construction to replace traditional wood and engineered wood
	trim. Hardietrim board was launched in fiscal year 1999, with the introduction of Hardietrim

	board,
<SUP STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 85%; VERTICAL-ALIGN: TEXT-TOP">
</SUP>
	from our Cleburne, Texas plant and demand has
	been strong
	since that time. A new production process for manufacturing Hardietrim board was completed at the
	Cleburne plant and production commenced in fiscal year 2002. Additional trim capacity was added in
	the Peru plant in fiscal years 2004 and 2005.
</DIV>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT; MARGIN-TOP: 6PT">
	We believe that our products provide certain performance, design and cost advantages. The principal
	fiber cement attribute in exterior applications is durability, particularly when compared to
	competing wood and wood-based products, while offering comparable aesthetics. Our fiber cement
	products exhibit superior resistance to the damaging effects of moisture, fire, impact and termites
	compared to wood and wood-based products, which has enabled us to gain a competitive advantage over
	competing products. Vinyl siding products generally have better durability characteristics than
	wood-based products, but typically cannot duplicate the superior aesthetics of fiber cement and
	lack the characteristics necessary for effectively accepting paint applications.
</DIV>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT; MARGIN-TOP: 6PT">
	Our fiber cement products provide strength and the ability to imprint simulated patterns that
	closely resemble patterns and profiles of traditional materials such as wood and stucco. The
	surface properties provide a superior paint-holding finish to wood and engineered wood products
	such that the periods between necessary maintenance and repainting are longer. Compared to masonry
	construction, fiber cement is lightweight, physically flexible and can be cut using readily
	available tools. This makes fiber cement suitable for lightweight construction across a range of
	architectural styles. Fiber cement is well suited to both timber and steel-framed construction.
</DIV>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT; MARGIN-TOP: 6PT">
	In our interior product range, our ceramic tile underlayment products provide superior handling and
	installation characteristics compared to fiberglass mesh cement boards. Compared to wood and
	wood-based products, our products provide the same general advantages that apply to external
	applications. In addition, our fiber cement products exhibit less movement in response to exposure
	to moisture than many alternative competing products, providing a more consistent and durable
	substrate on which to install tiles. In internal lining applications where exposure to moisture and
	impact damage are significant concerns, our products provide superior moisture resistance and
	impact resistance than traditional gypsum wet area wallboard and other competing products.

	Our earnings are seasonal and typically follow activity levels in the building and construction
	industry. In the United States, the calendar quarters ending in December and March generally
	reflect reduced levels of building activity depending on weather conditions. In Australia and New
	Zealand, the calendar quarter ending in March is usually affected by a slowdown due to summer
	holidays. In the Philippines, construction activity diminishes during the wet season from June
	through September and during the last half of December due to the slowdown in business activity
	over the holiday period. Also, general industry patterns can be affected by weather, economic
	conditions, industrial disputes and other factors. See Item&nbsp;3, &#147;Key Information &#151; Risk Factors.&#148;

	Raw Materials
</I>
</B>
</DIV>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT; MARGIN-TOP: 6PT">
	The principal raw materials used in the manufacture of fiber cement are cellulose fiber (wood-based
	pulp), silica (sand), portland cement and water. Pulp has historically demonstrated more price
	sensitivity than other raw materials that we use in our manufacturing process. In addition, cement
	prices rose in fiscal years 2007 and 2008, but declined in fiscal year 2009. We expect that pulp
	and cement prices will continue to fluctuate in the near future.
</DIV>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT; MARGIN-TOP: 6PT">
<I>
	Cellulose Fiber.
</I>
	Reliable access to specialized, consistent quality, low cost pulp is critical to
	the production of fiber cement building materials. Cellulose fiber is sourced from New Zealand, the
	United States, Canada, and South America (Chile) and is processed to our specifications. It is
	further processed using our proprietary technology to provide the reinforcing material in the
	cement matrix of fiber cement. We have developed a high level of internal expertise in the
	production and use of wood-based pulps. This expertise is shared with pulp producers, which have
	access to appropriate raw wood stocks, in order to formulate superior reinforcing pulps. The
	resulting pulp formulas are typically proprietary and are the subject of confidentiality agreements
	between the pulp producers and us. Moreover, we have obtained patents in the United States and in
	certain other countries abroad covering certain unique aspects of our pulping formulas and
	processes that we believe cannot adequately be protected through confidentiality agreements.
	However, we cannot assure you that our intellectual property and other proprietary information will
	be protected in all cases. See Item&nbsp;3, &#147;Key Information &#151; Risk Factors.&#148; During fiscal year 2008
	and the first half of fiscal year 2009, we experienced cost increases related to increases in the
	price of pulp. In the second half of fiscal year 2009, lower pulp prices had a favorable impact on
	our overall cost. We have entered into contracts that discount pulp prices in relation to various
	pulp indices over a longer-term and purchase our pulp from several qualified suppliers in an
	attempt to mitigate price increases and supply interruptions.
</DIV>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT; MARGIN-TOP: 6PT">
<I>
	Silica.
</I>
	High purity silica is sourced locally by the various production plants. In the majority of
	locations, we use silica sand as a silica source. In certain other locations, however, we process
	quartz rock and beneficiate silica sand to ensure the quality and consistency of this key raw
	material.
</DIV>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT; MARGIN-TOP: 6PT">
<I>
	Cement.
</I>
	Cement is acquired in bulk from local suppliers and is supplied on a just-in-time basis to
	our manufacturing facilities. The silos at each fiber cement plant hold between one and three days
	of our cement requirements. During fiscal year 2008, we experienced cost increases related to
	increases in the price of cement. This was primarily due to increases in energy related costs
	including coal, diesel and electricity, which adversely impacted materials that have a high energy
	cost component, including cement and quarrying products such as silica. In 2009, we were able to
	negotiate lower prices for cement with some of our cement suppliers based on the weakened economic
	conditions and lower energy costs primarily related to natural gas prices. We continue to evaluate
	options on agreements with suppliers for the purchase of cement that could fix our cement prices
	over longer periods of time.

	Sales, Marketing and Distribution
</B>
</DIV>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT; MARGIN-TOP: 6PT">
	The principal markets for our fiber cement products are the United States, Australia, New Zealand,
	the Philippines, Canada, and increasingly in parts of Europe, including the United Kingdom and
	France. In addition, we sell fiber cement products in many other countries, including Belgium,
	China, Denmark, Germany, Hong Kong, India, Indonesia, Ireland, Malta, the Middle East (Israel,
	Kuwait, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates), The Netherlands, Norway, various Pacific Islands,
	South Africa, South Korea, Spain, Sri Lanka, Switzerland, Taiwan, Turkey and Vietnam. Our brand
	name, customer education in comparative product advantages, differentiated product range and
	customer service, including technical advice and assistance, provide the basis for our marketing
	strategy. We offer our customers support through a specialized fiber cement sales force and
	customer service infrastructure in the United States, Australia, New Zealand, the Philippines,
	Europe and Canada. The customer service infrastructure includes inbound customer service support
	coordinated nationally in each country (customer service support for Canada is based out of the
	United States), and is complemented by outbound telemarketing capability. Within each regional
	market, we provide sales and marketing support to building products dealers and lumber yards and
	also provide support directly to the customers of these distribution channels, principally
	homebuilders and building contractors.
</DIV>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT; MARGIN-TOP: 6PT">
	In the United States, we sell fiber cement products for new residential construction predominantly
	to distributors, which then sell these products to dealers or lumber yards. This two-step
	distribution process is supplemented with direct sales to dealers as a means of accelerating
	product penetration and sales. Repair and remodel products in the United States are typically sold
	through the large home center retailers and specialist distributors. Our top five U.S. customers
	accounted for approximately 65% of our total USA Fiber Cement gross sales in fiscal year 2009. See
	Item&nbsp;3, &#147;Key Information &#151; Risk Factors.&#148; In Australia and New Zealand, both new construction and
	repair and remodel products are generally sold directly to distributor/hardware stores and lumber
	yards rather than through the two-step distribution process, which is generally used in the United
	States. In the Philippines, a network of thousands of small to medium size dealer outlets sells our
	fiber cement products to consumers, builders and real estate developers. Physical distribution of
	product in each country is primarily by road or sea transport, except for in the United States
	where transportation is primarily by road and a small use of rail.
</DIV>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT; MARGIN-TOP: 6PT">
	We maintain dedicated regional sales management teams in our major sales territories. As of May&nbsp;31,
	2009, the sales teams (including telemarketing staff) consisted of approximately 265 people in the
	United States and Canada, 71 people in Australia, 14 people in New Zealand, 35 people in the
	Philippines, and 27 people in Europe. We also employ one person based in Taiwan who functions as a
	regional export salesperson, and who covers markets such as South Korea, Hong Kong, Macau, China
	and the Middle East (Israel, Kuwait, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates). Our national sales
	managers and national account managers, together with the regional sales managers and sales
	representatives, maintain relationships with national and other major accounts. Our sales force
	includes skilled trades people who provide on-site technical advice and assistance. In some cases,
	sales forces manage specific product categories. For example, in the United States, there are
	individuals who may specialize in siding products or interior products, although recent
	reorganizations have integrated many of these individuals into collaborative teams. Some interior
	products sales representatives provide in-store merchandising support for home center retailers. We
	also use trade and consumer advertising and public relations campaigns to generate demand for our
	products. These campaigns usually explain the differentiating attributes of our fiber cement
	products and the suitability of our fiber cement products and systems for specific applications.
</DIV>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT; MARGIN-TOP: 6PT">
	Despite the fact that distributors and dealers are generally our direct customers, we also aim to
	increase primary demand for our products by marketing our products directly to homeowners,
	architects and builders. We encourage them to specify and install James Hardie

	because of the quality and craftsmanship of our products. This &#147;pull through&#148; strategy, in turn,
	assists us in expanding sales for our distribution network as distributors benefit from the
	increasing demand for our products. See Item&nbsp;3, &#147;Key Information &#151; Risk Factors.&#148;
</DIV>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT; MARGIN-TOP: 6PT">
	Geographic expansion of our fiber cement business has occurred in markets where framed construction
	is prevalent for residential applications or where there are opportunities to change building
	practices from masonry to framed construction. Expansion is also possible where there are direct
	substitution opportunities irrespective of the methods of construction. Our entry into the
	Philippines is an example of the ability to substitute fiber cement for an alternative product (in
	this case plywood). With the exception of our current major markets, as well as Japan and certain
	rural areas in Asia, Scandinavia, and Eastern Europe, most markets in the world principally utilize

	Because fiber cement products were relatively new to the Philippines, the launch of our fiber
	cement products in the Philippines in fiscal year 1999 was accompanied by strategies to address the
	particular needs of local customers and the building trade. For example, we established a carpenter
	training and accreditation program whereby Filipino carpenters who are unfamiliar with our products
	are taught installation techniques. We have also put greater emphasis on building our relationships

	development activities. In fiscal year 2009, we spent $28.3&nbsp;million or approximately 2.4% of total
	net sales, in research and development activities. This amount included $4.5&nbsp;million of amounts
	classified as selling, general and administration expenses. In fiscal year 2008, we spent $27.4

	Some environmental laws provide that a current or previous owner or operator of real property may
	be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of environmental contamination on, under, or in
	that property or other impacted properties. In addition, persons who arrange, or are deemed to have
	arranged, for the disposal or treatment of hazardous substances may also be liable for the costs of
	removal or remediation of environmental contamination at the disposal or treatment site, regardless
	of whether the affected site is owned or operated by such person. Environmental laws often impose
	liability whether or not the owner, operator or arranger knew of, or was responsible for, the
	presence of such environmental contamination. Also, third parties may make claims against owners or
	operators of properties for personal injuries, property damage and/or for clean-up associated with
	releases of hazardous or toxic substances pursuant to applicable environmental laws and common law
	tort theories, including strict liability.

<DIV ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT; MARGIN-TOP: 6PT">
	We currently expect to spend approximately $30&nbsp;million to $50&nbsp;million in fiscal year 2010 for
	capital expenditures, including facility upgrades and the implementation of new fiber cement
	technologies. The expected amount of spending in fiscal year 2010 includes additional capital
	expenditures expected to be made on projects that were in progress during fiscal year 2009,
	including the completion of a new finishing capability on an existing product line. We expect to
	fund our capital expenditures through a combination of internal cash and funds from our credit
	facilities.
</DIV>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT; MARGIN-TOP: 6PT">
	Competitive pressures and market developments could require further increases in capital
	expenditures. Our financing for these capital expenditures is expected to come from our cash from
	our future operations and from external debt to the extent that cash from operations does not cover
	our capital expenditures. However, if we are unable to extend our credit facilities, or are unable
	to renew our credit facilities on terms that are substantially similar to the ones we presently
	have, we may experience liquidity issues and may have to reduce our levels of planned capital
	expenditures to conserve cash for future cash flow requirements. See Item&nbsp;3, &#147;Key Information &#151;

	Our manufacturing plants use significant amounts of water which, after internal recycling and
	reuse, are eventually discharged to publicly owned treatment works (with the exception of our
	Blandon, Pennsylvania and Summerville, South Carolina facilities, which maintain a closed loop
	system). The discharge of process water is monitored by us, as well as by regulators. In addition,
	we are subject to regulations that govern the air quality and emissions from our plants. In the
	past, from time to time, we have received notices of discharges in excess of our water and air
	permit limits. In each case, we have addressed the concerns raised in those notices, including the
	payment of any associated minor fines. See Item&nbsp;3, &#147;Key Information &#151; Risk Factors.&#148;

	Annual design capacity is based on management&#146;s historical experience with our production
	process and is calculated assuming continuous operation, 24 hours per day, seven days per
	week, producing 5/16&#148; thickness siding at a target operating speed. Annual design capacity is
	not necessarily reflective of our actual capacity utilization at each plant. See below for a
	description of average capacity utilization rates for our fiber cement plants by country.
	Plants outside the United States produce a range of thicker products, which negatively affect
	their outputs. Actual production is affected by factors such as product mix, batch size, plant
	availability and production speeds and is usually less than annual design capacity.

	While the same basic process is used to manufacture fiber cement products at each facility, plants
	are designed to produce the appropriate mix of products to meet each market&#146;s specific, projected
	needs. Many of our manufacturing facilities have been either newly constructed or substantially
	modernized and upgraded in the past five years. The facilities were constructed so production can
	be efficiently adjusted in response to increased consumer demand by increasing production capacity
	utilization, enhancing the economies of scale or adding additional lines to existing facilities, or
	making corresponding reductions in production capacity in response to weaker demand. Except for the
	Waxahachie, Texas plant, we own all of our fiber cement sites and plants located in the United
	States. The lease for the Waxahachie, Texas site and plant expires on March&nbsp;31, 2020, at which time

	Management Inc., which we collectively refer to as Brookfield Multiplex), an unrelated third party,
	acquired the land and buildings related to these three fiber cement manufacturing facilities from
	Amaca. The land and buildings on which these facilities are located are leased on a long-term basis

	March&nbsp;23, 2019, and contain options to renew for two further terms of 10&nbsp;years expiring in March

<DIV ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT; MARGIN-TOP: 6PT">
	The AICF commissioned an updated actuarial study of potential asbestos-related liabilities as of
	March&nbsp;31, 2009. Based on KPMG Actuaries&#146; assumptions, KPMG Actuaries arrived at a range of possible
	total cash flows and proposed a central estimate which is intended to reflect an expected outcome.
	We view the central estimate as the basis for recording the asbestos liability in our financial
	statements, which under U.S. GAAP, we consider the best estimate under SFAS No.&nbsp;5, &#147;Accounting for
	Contingencies.&#148; Based on the results of these studies, it is estimated that the discounted (but
	inflated) value of the central estimate for claims against the Former James Hardie Companies was
	approximately A$1.8&nbsp;billion ($1.2&nbsp;billion). The undiscounted (but inflated) value of the central
	estimate of the asbestos-related liabilities of Amaca and Amaba as determined by KPMG Actuaries was
	approximately A$3.1&nbsp;billion ($2.1&nbsp;billion). Actual liabilities of those companies for such claims
	could vary, perhaps materially, from the central estimate described above. The asbestos liability
	includes projected future cash flows as undiscounted and uninflated on the basis that it is
	inappropriate to discount or inflate future cash flows when the timing and amounts of such cash
	flows are not fixed or readily determinable.

<DIV ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT; MARGIN-TOP: 6PT">
	The asbestos liability has been revised to reflect the most recent actuarial estimate prepared by
	KPMG Actuaries as of March&nbsp;31, 2009 and to adjust for payments made to claimants during the year
	then ended.
</DIV>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT; MARGIN-TOP: 6PT">
	In estimating the potential financial exposure, KPMG Actuaries made assumptions related to the
	total number of claims which were reasonably estimated to be asserted through 2071, the typical
	cost of settlement (which is sensitive to, among other factors, the industry in which a plaintiff
	claims exposure, the alleged disease type and the jurisdiction in which the action is brought), the
	legal costs incurred in the litigation of such claims, the rate of receipt of claims, the
	settlement strategy in dealing with outstanding claims and the timing of settlements.
</DIV>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT; MARGIN-TOP: 6PT">
	Due to inherent uncertainties in the legal and medical environment, the number and timing of future
	claim notifications and settlements, the recoverability of claims against insurance contracts, and
	estimates of future trends in average claim awards, as well as the extent to which the above named
	entities will contribute to the overall settlements, the actual amount of liability could differ
	materially from that which is currently projected.
</DIV>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT; MARGIN-TOP: 6PT">
	The potential range of costs as estimated by KPMG Actuaries is affected by a number of variables
	such as nil settlement rates (where no settlement is payable by the Former James Hardie Companies
	because the claim settlement is borne by other asbestos defendants (other than the former James
	Hardie subsidiaries) which are held liable), peak year of claims, past history of claims numbers,
	average settlement rates, past history of Australian asbestos-related medical injuries, current
	number of claims, average defense and plaintiff legal costs, base wage inflation and superimposed
	inflation. The potential range of losses disclosed includes both asserted and unasserted claims.
	While no assurances can be provided, we believe that we are likely to be able to partially recover
	losses from various insurance carriers. As of March&nbsp;31, 2009, KPMG Actuaries&#146; undiscounted central
	estimate of asbestos-related liabilities was A$3.1&nbsp;billion ($2.1&nbsp;billion). This undiscounted (but
	inflated) central estimate is net of expected insurance recoveries of A$462.3&nbsp;million ($317.7
	million) after making a general credit risk allowance for bad debt insurance carriers and an
	allowance for A$83.5&nbsp;million ($57.4&nbsp;million) of &#147;by claim&#148; or subrogation recoveries from other
	third parties. In accordance with FIN 39, we have not netted the insurance receivable against the
	asbestos liability on our consolidated balance sheets.
</DIV>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT; MARGIN-TOP: 6PT">
	A sensitivity analysis has been performed to determine how the actuarial estimates would change if
	certain assumptions (i.e., the rate of inflation and superimposed inflation, the average costs of
	claims and legal fees, and the projected numbers of claims) were different from the assumptions
	used to determine the central estimates. This analysis shows that the discounted (but inflated)
	central estimates could be in a range of A$1.2&nbsp;billion ($0.8&nbsp;billion) to A$2.6&nbsp;billion ($1.8
	billion) (undiscounted, but inflated, estimates of A$1.9&nbsp;billion ($1.3&nbsp;billion) to A$5.5&nbsp;billion
	($3.8&nbsp;billion)), as of March&nbsp;31, 2009. It should be noted that the actual cost of the liabilities
	could be outside of that range depending on the results of actual experience relative to the
	assumptions made. One of the critical assumptions of the analysis is the estimated peak year of
	mesothelioma disease claims which is targeted for 2010/2011. Potential variation in this estimate
	has an impact much greater than the other sensitivities. If the peak year occurs five years later,
	in 2015-2016, the discounted central estimate could increase by approximately 50%.

	As noted previously, we have entered into deeds of indemnity with certain of our directors and

	contain an indemnity for directors and officers. To date, claims for payments of expenses incurred
	have been received from certain former directors and officers in relation to the ASIC
	investigation, the examination of those persons by ASIC delegates and in respect of their defense
	costs of the ASIC proceedings. We have and may continue to incur costs under these indemnities
	which may be significant. In this respect, we have obligations, or have agreed, to advance funds in
	respect of defense costs and such advances have been and may continue to be made. Currently, a
	portion of the defense costs of former directors are being advanced by third parties, with us
	paying the balance. Based upon the information available to us presently, we expect this
	arrangement to continue. We note that other recoveries may be available, including as a result of
	repayments by former directors and officers in accordance with the terms of their indemnities. It
	is our policy to expense legal costs as incurred. We may also incur a liability to meet a
	proportion of ASIC&#146;s costs of the ASIC proceedings.

<DIV ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT; MARGIN-TOP: 6PT">
	There remains uncertainty surrounding the likely outcome of the ASIC proceedings and any potential
	appeals. There is a possibility that we could become responsible for other amounts in addition to
	defense costs, such as a proportion of ASIC&#146;s costs, as noted above. However, at this stage, we
	believe that although such amounts are reasonably possible, the amount or range of such amounts is

</DIV>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT; MARGIN-TOP: 6PT">
	Due to our size and the nature of our business, we are subject to ongoing reviews by taxing
	jurisdictions on various tax matters, including challenges to various positions we assert on our
	income tax returns. We accrue for tax contingencies based upon our best estimate of the taxes
	ultimately expected to be paid, which we update over time as more information becomes available.
	Such amounts are included in taxes payable or other non-current liabilities, as appropriate. If we
	ultimately determine that payment of these amounts is unnecessary, we reverse the liability and
	recognize a tax benefit during the period in which we determine that the liability is no longer
	necessary. We record additional tax expense in the period in which we determine that the recorded
	tax liability is less than the ultimate assessment we expect.
</DIV>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT; MARGIN-TOP: 6PT">
	In fiscal years 2009, 2008 and 2007, we recorded income tax benefit of $3.0&nbsp;million, nil and $10.4
	million, respectively, as a result of the finalization of certain tax audits (whereby certain
	matters were settled), the expiration of the statute of limitations related to certain tax
	positions and adjustments to income tax balances based on the filing of amended income tax returns,
	which give rise to the benefit recorded by us.
</DIV>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT; MARGIN-TOP: 6PT">
	We or one of our subsidiaries file income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction, and various
	states and foreign jurisdictions including Australia and The Netherlands. We are no longer subject
	to U.S. federal examinations by the IRS for tax years prior to tax year 2007. We are no longer
	subject to examinations by The Netherlands tax authority, for tax years prior to tax year 2002. We
	are no longer subject to Australian federal examinations by the ATO for tax years prior to tax year
	2007.
</DIV>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT; MARGIN-TOP: 6PT">
	We currently derive significant tax benefits under the US-Netherlands tax treaty. The treaty was
	amended during fiscal year 2005 and became effective for us on February&nbsp;1, 2006. The amended treaty
	provides, among other things, requirements that we must meet for us to continue to qualify for
	treaty benefits and our effective income tax rate. During fiscal year 2006, we made changes to our
	organizational and operational structure to satisfy the requirements of the amended treaty and
	believe that we are in compliance and should continue qualifying for treaty benefits. However, if
	during a subsequent tax audit or related process, the IRS determines that these changes do not meet
	the requirements, we may not qualify for treaty benefits and our effective income tax rate could
	significantly increase beginning in the fiscal year that such determination is made and we could be
	liable for taxes owed for calendar year 2008 and subsequent periods.

	As announced on December&nbsp;12, 2008, we and the ATO reached an agreement that finalized tax audits
	being conducted by the ATO on our Australian income tax returns for the years ended March&nbsp;31, 2002
	and March&nbsp;31, 2004 through March&nbsp;31, 2006 and settled all outstanding issues arising from these tax
	audits. With the exception of the assessment in respect of RCI (see below) for the 1999 financial
	year, the settlement concluded ATO audit activities for all years prior to the year ended March&nbsp;31,
	2007. The agreed settlement, made without concessions or admissions of liability by either us or
	the ATO, required us to pay an amount of A$153.0&nbsp;million ($101.6&nbsp;million) in December&nbsp;2008.

	Amended Australian Taxation Office Assessment
</I>
</B>
</DIV>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT; MARGIN-TOP: 6PT">
	In March&nbsp;2006, RCI, our wholly owned subsidiary, received an amended assessment from the ATO in
	respect of RCI&#146;s income tax return for the year ended March&nbsp;31, 1999.
</DIV>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT; MARGIN-TOP: 6PT">
	On May&nbsp;30, 2007, the ATO issued a Notice of Decision disallowing our objection to the amended
	assessment (which we refer to as Objection Decision). On July&nbsp;11, 2007, we filed an application
	appealing the Objection Decision with the Federal Court of Australia. The hearing date for RCI&#146;s
	appeal is scheduled to take place no later than September&nbsp;2009.
</DIV>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT; MARGIN-TOP: 6PT">
	We believe that it is more likely than not that the tax position reported in RCI&#146;s tax return for
	the 1999 fiscal year will be upheld on appeal. Therefore, we believe that the requirements under
	FIN 48 for recording a liability have not been met and therefore we have not recorded any liability
	at March&nbsp;31, 2009 for the amended assessment.
</DIV>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT; MARGIN-TOP: 6PT">
	We expect that amounts paid in respect of the amended assessment will be recovered by RCI (with
	interest) at the time RCI is successful in its appeal against the amended assessment. As a result,
	we have treated all payments in respect of the amended assessment that have been made up to March
	31, 2009 as a deposit and it is our intention to treat any payments to be made at a later date as a
	deposit. As of March&nbsp;31, 2009 and 2008, this deposit totaled A$252.5&nbsp;million ($173.5&nbsp;million) and
	A$224.4&nbsp;million ($205.8&nbsp;million &#150; converted at the March&nbsp;31, 2008 spot rate), respectively.

	The Company and the Building Product Markets
</B>
</DIV>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT; MARGIN-TOP: 6PT">
	Based on net sales, we believe we are the largest manufacturer of fiber cement products and systems
	for internal and external building construction applications in the United States, Australia, New
	Zealand, and the Philippines. Our current primary geographic markets include the United States,
	Australia, New Zealand, the Philippines, Europe and Canada. Through significant research and
	development expenditure, we develop key product and production process technologies that we patent
	or hold as trade secrets. We believe that these technologies give us a competitive advantage.
</DIV>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT; MARGIN-TOP: 6PT">
	Our fiber cement products are used in a number of markets, including new residential construction
	(single and multi-family housing), manufactured housing (mobile and pre-fabricated homes), repair
	and remodeling and a variety of commercial and industrial applications (stores, warehouses,
	offices, hotels, motels, schools, libraries, museums, dormitories, hospitals, detention facilities,
	religious buildings and gymnasiums). We manufacture numerous types of fiber cement products with a
	variety of patterned profiles and surface finishes for a range of applications, including external
	siding and soffit lining, internal linings, facades, fencing and floor and tile underlayments.
</DIV>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT; MARGIN-TOP: 6PT">
	Our products are primarily sold in the residential housing markets. Residential construction levels
	fluctuate based on new home construction activity and the repair and renovation of existing homes.
	These levels of activity are affected by many factors, including home mortgage interest rates, the
	availability of financing to homeowners to purchase a new home or make improvements to their
	existing homes, inflation rates, unemployment levels, existing home sales, the average age and the
	size of housing inventory, consumer home repair and renovation spending, gross domestic product
	growth and consumer confidence levels. A number of these factors continued to be generally
	unfavorable during fiscal year 2009, resulting in weaker residential construction activity.

	Fiscal Year 2009 Key Results

</DIV>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT; MARGIN-TOP: 6PT">
	Total net sales decreased 18% to $1,202.6&nbsp;million in fiscal year 2009. We recorded an operating
	profit of $173.6&nbsp;million in fiscal year 2009 compared to an operating loss of $36.6&nbsp;million in
	fiscal year 2008, which was adversely affected by the unfavorable asbestos adjustment of $240.1
	million. We reported income from continuing operations of $136.3&nbsp;million in fiscal year 2009.
</DIV>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT; MARGIN-TOP: 6PT">
	Our largest market is North America. Based on the NAHB&#146;s Builder Practices Reports, for the past
	three years, fiber cement has been one of the fastest growing segments (in terms of market growth)
	of the U.S. residential exteriors industry. During fiscal year 2009, USA and Europe Fiber Cement

	Operating income for our USA and Europe Fiber Cement segment decreased from fiscal year 2008

	During fiscal year 2009, Asia Pacific net sales contributed approximately 23% of total net sales.

	Critical Accounting Policies

<DIV ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT; MARGIN-TOP: 6PT">
	The accounting policies affecting our financial condition and results of operations are more fully
	described in Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included in Item&nbsp;18. Certain of our
	accounting policies require the application of judgment by management in selecting appropriate
	assumptions for calculating financial estimates, which inherently contain some degree of
	uncertainty. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and other assumptions that are
	believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making
	judgments about the reported carrying value of assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of
	revenues and expenses that may not be readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may
	differ from these estimates under different assumptions and conditions. We consider the following
	policies to be the most critical in understanding the judgments that are involved in preparing our
	consolidated financial statements and the uncertainties that could impact our results of
	operations, financial condition and cash flows.

	Accounting for Contingencies

</B>
</DIV>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT; MARGIN-TOP: 6PT">
	We account for loss contingencies in accordance with SFAS No.&nbsp;5 under which we accrue amounts for
	losses arising from contingent obligations when the obligations are probable and the amounts are
	reasonably estimable. As facts concerning contingencies become known, we reassess our situation and
	make appropriate adjustments to the consolidated financial statements. For additional information
	regarding asbestos-related matters, ASIC proceedings, and Chile litigation, see Item&nbsp;3, &#147;Key
	Information &#151; Risk Factors,&#148; Item&nbsp;4, &#147;Information on the Company &#151; Commitment to Provide Funding on

	Accounting for the Amended FFA
</I>
</B>
</DIV>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT; MARGIN-TOP: 6PT">
	Prior to March&nbsp;31, 2007, our consolidated financial statements included an asbestos provision
	relating to our anticipated future payments to the AICF based on the terms of the Original Final
	Funding Agreement as announced on December&nbsp;1, 2005 (which we refer to as the Original FFA).
</DIV>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT; MARGIN-TOP: 6PT">
	In February&nbsp;2007, the Amended FFA was approved to provide long-term funding to the AICF, a special
	purpose fund that provides compensation for Australian asbestos-related personal injury and death
	claims for which the Former James Hardie Companies are found liable.
</DIV>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT; MARGIN-TOP: 6PT">
	The amount of the asbestos liability reflects the terms of the Amended FFA, which has been
	calculated by reference to (but is not exclusively based upon) the most recent actuarial estimate
	of projected future cash flows prepared by KPMG Actuaries. Based on the their assumptions, the KPMG
	Actuaries arrived at a range of possible total cash flows and proposed a central estimate which is
	intended to reflect an expected outcome. The Company views the central estimate as the basis for
	recording the asbestos liability in the Company&#146;s financial statements, which under U.S. GAAP, it
	considers the best estimate under SFAS No.&nbsp;5. The asbestos liability includes these cash flows as
	undiscounted and uninflated on the basis that it is inappropriate to discount or inflate future
	cash flows when the timing and amounts of such cash flows is not fixed or readily determinable.

	The asbestos liability also includes an allowance for the future operating costs of the AICF.
</DIV>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT; MARGIN-TOP: 6PT">
	In estimating the potential financial exposure, KPMG Actuaries has made a number of assumptions.
	These include an estimate of the total number of claims by disease type which are reasonably
	estimated to be asserted through 2071, the typical average cost of a claim settlement (which is
	sensitive to, among other factors, the industry in which the plaintiff claims exposure, the alleged
	disease type and the jurisdiction in which the action is being brought), the legal costs incurred
	in the litigation of such claims, the proportion of claims for which liability is repudiated, the
	rate of receipt of claims, the settlement strategy in dealing with outstanding claims, the timing
	of settlements of future claims and the long-term rate of inflation of claim awards and legal
	costs.
</DIV>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT; MARGIN-TOP: 6PT">
	Due to inherent uncertainties in the legal and medical environment, the number and timing of future
	claim notifications and settlements, the recoverability of claims against insurance contracts, and
	estimates of future trends in average claim awards, as well as the extent to which the above-named
	entities will contribute to the overall settlements, the actual amount of liability could differ
	materially from that which is currently projected and could result in significant debits or credits
	to the consolidated balance sheet and statement of operations.
</DIV>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT; MARGIN-TOP: 6PT">
	An updated actuarial assessment will be performed as of March&nbsp;31 each year. Any changes in the
	estimate will be reflected as a charge or credit to the consolidated statements of operations for
	the year then ended. Material adverse changes to the actuarial estimate would have an adverse

	We evaluate the collectability of accounts receivable on an ongoing basis based on historical bad

	activity. An allowance for doubtful accounts is provided for known and estimated bad debts.
	Although credit losses have historically been within our expectations, we cannot guarantee that we
	will continue to experience the same credit loss rates that we have in the past. Because our
	accounts receivable are concentrated in a relatively small number of customers, a significant
	change in the liquidity or financial position of any of these customers could impact their ability
	to make payments and result in the need for additional allowances which would decrease our net

<DIV ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT; MARGIN-TOP: 6PT">
	Inventories are recorded at the lower of cost or market. In order to determine market, management
	regularly reviews inventory quantities on hand and evaluates significant items to determine whether
	they are excess, slow-moving or obsolete. The estimated value of excess, slow-moving and obsolete
	inventory is recorded as a reduction to inventory and an expense in cost of sales in the period it
	is identified. This estimate requires management to make judgments about the future demand for
	inventory, and is therefore at risk to change from period to period. If our estimate for the future
	demand for inventory is greater than actual demand and we fail to reduce manufacturing output
	accordingly, we could be required to record additional inventory reserves, which would have a
	negative impact on our gross profit. For additional information regarding our inventories, see Item
	3, &#147;Key Information &#151; Risk Factors.&#148;

	We offer various warranties on our products, including a 50-year limited warranty on certain of our
	fiber cement siding products in the United States. Because our fiber cement products have only been
	used in North America since the early 1990s, there is a risk that these products will not perform
	in accordance with our expectations over an extended period of time. A typical warranty program
	requires that we replace defective products within a specified time period from the date of sale.
	We record an estimate for future warranty-related costs based on an analysis by us, which includes
	the historical relationship of warranty costs to installed product. Based on this analysis and
	other factors, we adjust the amount of our warranty provisions as necessary. Although our warranty
	costs have historically been within calculated estimates, if our experience is significantly

	We account for income taxes according to FASB&#146;s Statement No.&nbsp;109, &#147;Accounting for Income Taxes,&#148;
	under which we compute our deferred tax assets and liabilities, which arise from differences in the
	timing of recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes. We must
	assess whether, and to what extent, we can recover our deferred tax assets. If full or partial
	recovery is unlikely, we must increase our income tax expense by recording a valuation allowance
	against the portion of deferred tax assets that we cannot recover. We believe that we will recover
	all of the deferred tax assets recorded (net of valuation allowance) on our consolidated balance
	sheet at March&nbsp;31, 2009. However, if facts later indicate that we will be unable to recover all or
	a portion of our net deferred tax assets, our income tax expense would increase in the period in
	which we determine that recovery is unlikely.

<DIV ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT; MARGIN-TOP: 6PT">
	We account for uncertain income tax positions according to FIN 48, &#147;Accounting for Uncertainty in
	Income Taxes an interpretation of FASB Statement No.109.&#148; Due to our size and the nature of our
	business, we are subject to ongoing reviews by taxing jurisdictions on various tax matters,
	including challenges to various positions we assert on our income tax returns. Positions taken by
	an entity in its income tax returns must satisfy a more-likely-than-not recognition threshold,
	assuming that the positions will be examined by taxing authorities with full knowledge of all
	relevant information, in order for the positions to be recognized in the consolidated financial
	statements. Each quarter we evaluate the income tax positions taken, or expected to be taken, to
	determine whether these positions meet the more-likely-than-not threshold prescribed by FIN 48. We
	are required to make subjective judgments and assumptions regarding our income tax exposures and
	must consider a variety of factors, including the current tax statutes and the current status of
	audits performed by tax authorities in each tax jurisdiction. To the extent an uncertain tax
	position is resolved for an amount that varies from the recorded estimated liability, our income
	tax expense in a given financial statement period could be materially affected.

</I>
	. Net sales decreased 21% from $1,170.5&nbsp;million in fiscal year
	2008 to $929.3&nbsp;million in fiscal year 2009 due to decreased sales volume, slightly offset by a
	higher average net sales price. Sales volume decreased 22% from 1,951.2 mmsf in fiscal year 2008 to
	1,526.6 mmsf in fiscal year 2009, primarily due to weaker demand for our products in the U.S. as a
	result of continuing weakness in housing construction activity and deteriorating economic
	conditions. Although housing affordability has increased, we believe that demand is being
	restricted by limited availability of mortgage credit for prospective home buyers and lack of
	consumer confidence. The average net sales price increased 2% from $600 per msf in fiscal year 2008
	to $609 per msf in fiscal year 2009. As announced on May&nbsp;22, 2008, we have closed the USA Hardie
	Pipe business. An insignificant amount of sales related to this business were recorded in fiscal
	year 2009.

<DIV ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT; MARGIN-TOP: 6PT">
	The USA and Europe Fiber Cement business recorded its seventh consecutive quarter where sales
	declined compared to the corresponding quarter in the previous year, reflecting the on-going
	deterioration in U.S. housing starts. The NAHB reported U.S. housing starts of a
	seasonally-adjusted annual rate for the quarter ended March&nbsp;31, 2009 of 523,000 units, down 50%
	from the 1.053&nbsp;million units for the corresponding quarter in fiscal year 2008.
</DIV>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT; MARGIN-TOP: 6PT">
	The decline in top-line performance was due to reduced exterior and interior product volumes, as
	product demand was lower in all regions. Lower SG&#038;A costs and a higher average selling price
	partially offset lower volumes and the higher unit cost of sales due to product mix and material
	costs. The business continues to focus on its three main strategic initiatives of primary demand
	growth, product mix shift and zero to landfill, and progress is being made on these initiatives
	despite softening market demand.
</DIV>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT; MARGIN-TOP: 6PT">
	Our differentiated ColorPlus&#174; range of products continues to contribute to primary demand growth.
	Our initial focus on the ColorPlus range of products against vinyl siding manufacturers in the
	northern region of the United States has now been expanded to the western and southern regions of
	the United States with both areas posting moderate gains in ColorPlus penetration rate compared to
	fiscal year 2008.

	. Net sales decreased 8% from $298.3&nbsp;million in fiscal year 2008
	to $273.3&nbsp;million in fiscal year 2009 due to a 6% decrease in the average net sales price and a

	currencies compared to the U.S. dollar accounted for an 8% decrease in net sales in U.S. dollars.&nbsp;

	In Australia, the Scyon&#153; product range continues to build momentum with fiscal year 2009 sales
	volumes up 47% compared to fiscal year 2008. Scyon differentiated products now represent 10.7% of
	sales, up from 7.5% in fiscal year 2008. Growth has been particularly strong for Scyon Stria&#153;
	cladding and Scyon Secura&#153; external flooring released during fiscal year 2009. An increased share
	of the residential market was achieved by increasing the volume of differentiated James Hardie
	products used in individual homes. Core products also regained volume in the face of increased
	competition, although revenue was affected by low-priced imports. For fiscal year 2009, the
	Australian Bureau of Statistics reported total dwelling unit approvals of 134,499 units, down 14%
	from 156,697 unit approvals for fiscal year 2008. Sales in the multi-unit sector also remained
	depressed as the lack of available credit and general economic uncertainty led to a reduction in
	investment through the second half of calendar year 2008. While some cost improvements have been
	achieved, these have been largely offset by increases in some input costs resulting from a
	depreciating Australian dollar and from lower production volumes and higher utility costs. In New
	Zealand, residential construction continues to decline, with total residential approvals for fiscal
	year 2009 down 34% to 16,200 units compared to fiscal year 2008. The New Zealand business continued
	to out-perform the market by growing sales of its differentiated range of products, including

	preclad lining which was launched during fiscal year 2009. Sales of these differentiated products
	now account for almost half of sales volume. The Philippines business reported lower sales volumes
	and revenue as a result of a softening domestic market, and export volumes affected by the global
	slow down and pricing pressures stemming from Asian currencies&#146; depreciation against the U.S.

	On April&nbsp;24, 2009 a trial court in Santiago, Chile awarded damages in the equivalent of $13.4

	Cementa in 2007. FC Volcan is appealing the decision to the Santiago Court of Appeal.
</DIV>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT; MARGIN-TOP: 6PT">
	Cementa, a fiber cement manufacturer in Chile, commenced anti-trust proceedings in 2003 against FC
	Volcan, alleging that it had engaged in predatory pricing, by selling products below cost when it
	entered the Chilean market, in breach of the relevant anti-trust laws in Chile. Another fiber
	cement manufacturer in Chile, Quimel, also joined the proceedings.
</DIV>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT; MARGIN-TOP: 6PT">

	Our treasury policy regarding our liquidity management, foreign exchange risks management, interest
	rate risk management and cash management is administered by our treasury department and is
	centralized in The Netherlands. This policy is reviewed annually and is designed to ensure that we
	have sufficient liquidity to support our business activities and meet future business requirements
	in the countries in which we operate. Counterparty limits are managed by our treasury department
	and based upon the counterparty credit rating; total exposure to any one counterparty is limited to
	specified amounts and signed off annually by the Chief Financial Officer.
</DIV>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT; MARGIN-TOP: 6PT">
	We have historically met our working capital needs and capital expenditure requirements through a
	combination of cash flow from operations, proceeds from the divestiture of businesses, credit
	facilities and other borrowings, proceeds from the sale of property, plant and equipment, and
	proceeds from the redemption of investments. Seasonal fluctuations in working capital generally
	have not had a significant impact on our short-term or long-term liquidity. We anticipate that we
	will have sufficient funds to meet our planned working capital and other cash requirements for the
	next 12&nbsp;months based on our existing cash balances and anticipated operating cash flows arising
	during the year. We anticipate that any additional cash requirements will be met from existing
	cash, unutilized committed facilities, anticipated future net operating cash flows and proposed new
	facilities.

	Excluding restricted cash, we had cash and cash equivalents of $42.4&nbsp;million as of March&nbsp;31, 2009.
	At that date, we also had credit facilities totaling $498.3&nbsp;million, of which $324.0&nbsp;million was
	drawn. The credit facilities are all uncollateralized and consist of the following:

	The weighted average remaining term of the total credit facilities, $498.3&nbsp;million, at March&nbsp;31,
	2009 was 1.6&nbsp;years. For all facilities, the interest rate is calculated two business days prior to
	the commencement of each draw-down period based on the US$ London Interbank Offered Rate (which we
	refer to as LIBOR) plus the margins of individual lenders and is payable at the end of each
	draw-down period. During fiscal year 2009, we paid $0.9&nbsp;million in commitment fees. As of March&nbsp;31,
	2009, $324.0&nbsp;million was drawn under the combined facilities and $174.3&nbsp;million was available.

	In March&nbsp;2006, RCI received an amended assessment from the ATO of A$412.0&nbsp;million. The assessment
	was subsequently amended to A$368.0&nbsp;million ($252.9&nbsp;million).
</DIV>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT; MARGIN-TOP: 6PT">
	During fiscal year 2007, we agreed with the ATO that in accordance with the ATO Receivables Policy,
	we would pay 50% of the total amended assessment being A$184.0&nbsp;million ($148.4&nbsp;million &#150; converted
	at the March&nbsp;31, 2007 spot rate) and provide a guarantee from JHI NV in favor of the ATO for the
	remaining unpaid 50% of the amended assessment, pending outcome of the appeal of the amended
	assessment. We also agreed to pay GIC accruing on the unpaid balance of the amended assessment in
	arrears on a quarterly basis. Up to March&nbsp;31, 2009, we have paid A$108.7&nbsp;million ($74.7&nbsp;million) of
	GIC to the ATO. This amount includes GIC of A$76.7&nbsp;million ($52.7&nbsp;million) paid as part of the
	payment of A$184.0&nbsp;million ($148.4&nbsp;million &#150; converted at the March&nbsp;31, 2007 spot rate) towards the
	amended assessment in fiscal year 2007. On April&nbsp;15, 2009, we paid an additional amount of A$2.7
	million ($1.9&nbsp;million) in GIC related to the quarter ended March&nbsp;31, 2009.

<DIV ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT; MARGIN-TOP: 6PT">
	RCI strongly disputes the amended assessment and is pursuing all avenues of appeal to contest the
	ATO&#146;s position in this matter. We believe that RCI&#146;s view on its tax position will ultimately
	prevail in this matter. As a result, we have treated all payments in respect of the amended
	assessment and the accrued interest receivable on such payments as of March&nbsp;31, 2009 as a deposit.
	It is our intention to treat any payments to be made at a later date and accrued interest
	receivable as a deposit. We expect that any amounts paid would be recovered, with interest, by RCI
	at the time RCI is successful in its appeal against the amended assessment. However, if RCI is
	unsuccessful in its appeal, RCI will be required to pay the entire assessment. As of March&nbsp;31,
	2009, we had not recorded any liability for the amended assessment as we believe the requirements
	under FIN 48 for recording a liability have not been met. For more information, see Note 14 to our
	consolidated financial statements in Item&nbsp;18 and Item&nbsp;3, &#147;Key Information &#151; Risk Factors.&#148;

	If we are unable to extend our credit facilities, or are unable to renew our credit facilities on

	Under the terms of the Amended FFA, we are required to fund the AICF on an annual basis, depending
	on our net operating cash flow. The initial funding payment of A$184.3&nbsp;million ($145.0&nbsp;million at
	the time of payment) was made to the AICF in February&nbsp;2007 and annual payments will be made each
	July. The amounts of these annual payments are dependent on several factors, including our free
	cash flow (defined as cash from operations in accordance with GAAP in force at the date of the
	Original FFA), actuarial estimations, actual claims paid, operating expenses of the AICF and the
	annual cash flow cap. No contribution was required to be made under the Amended FFA in fiscal year
	2008. Further contributions in fiscal year 2009 were made on a quarterly basis in July and October
	2008 and in January and March&nbsp;2009, totaling A$118.0&nbsp;million (inclusive of interest). Under the
	terms of the Amended FFA, we are not required to make a contribution to the AICF in fiscal year
	2010. Future funding for the AICF continues to be linked under the terms of the Amended FFA to our
	long-term financial success, especially our ability to generate net operating cash flow.
</DIV>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT; MARGIN-TOP: 6PT">
	We anticipate that our cash flows from operations, net of estimated payments under the Amended FFA,
	will be sufficient to fund our planned capital expenditure and working capital requirements in the
	short-term. If we do not generate sufficient cash from operations to fund our planned capital
	expenditures and working capital requirements, we believe the cash and cash equivalents of $42.4
	million at March&nbsp;31, 2009, and the cash that we anticipate will be available to us under credit
	facilities, will be sufficient to meet any cash shortfalls during at least the next 12&nbsp;months.
</DIV>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT; MARGIN-TOP: 6PT">
	We expect to rely primarily on increased market penetration of our products and increased
	profitability from a more favorable product mix to generate cash to fund our long-term growth.
	Historically, our products have been well-accepted by the market and our product mix has changed
	towards higher-priced, differentiated products that generate higher margins.

	We have historically reinvested a portion of the cash generated from our operations to fund
	additional capital expenditures, including research and development activities, which we believe
	have facilitated greater market penetration and increased profitability. Our ability to meet our
	long-term liquidity needs, including our long-term growth plan, is dependent on the continuation of
	this trend and other factors discussed here.

<DIV ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT; MARGIN-TOP: 6PT">
	In May&nbsp;2007, we announced a dividend policy of a payout ratio of between 50% to 75% of net income
	before asbestos adjustments, subject to funding requirements. In November&nbsp;2008, we announced that
	our Board decided to omit the interim dividend for the current fiscal year and that we would
	continue to review our dividend policy, but that it was likely dividends would be suspended until
	conditions improved significantly. Having undertaken a further review of our dividend policy, our
	Board decided to omit the year-end dividend to conserve capital. Until market and global economic
	conditions improve significantly and the level of uncertainty surrounding future industry trends as
	well as company specific contingencies dissipates, we anticipate that dividends will continue to be
	suspended in order to conserve capital.
</DIV>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT; MARGIN-TOP: 6PT">
	We believe our business is affected by general economic conditions, such as level of employment,
	consumer confidence, consumer income, the availability of financing and interest rates in the
	United States and in other countries because these factors affect housing affordability and the
	level of housing prices. Over the past several years, the ongoing sub-prime mortgage fallout,
	rising unemployment, increased foreclosures, high current inventory of unsold homes, tighter credit
	and volatile equity markets have materially adversely impacted our business. We expect that
	business derived from current U.S. forecasts of new housing starts and renovation and remodel
	expenditures will result in our operations generating cash flow sufficient to fund the majority of
	our planned capital expenditures. It is possible that a deeper than expected decline in new housing
	starts in the United States or in other countries in which we manufacture and sell our products
	would negatively impact our growth and our current levels of revenue and profitability and
	therefore decrease our liquidity and ability to generate sufficient cash from operations to meet
	our capital requirements. See Item&nbsp;3, &#147;Key Information &#151; Risk Factors.&#148;
</DIV>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT; MARGIN-TOP: 6PT">
	Pulp and cement are primary ingredients in our fiber cement formulation, which have been subject to
	price volatility, affecting our working capital requirements. See Item&nbsp;3, &#147;Key Information &#151; Risk
	Factors.&#148; Pulp prices are discounted from a global index, Northern Bleached Softwood Kraft, or
	NBSK, which based on information we receive from RISI and other sources are predicted to remain low
	but increase moderately in the later part of fiscal year 2010. To minimize additional working
	capital requirements caused by rising pulp prices, we have entered into contracts that discount
	pulp prices in relation to various pulp indices over a longer-term and purchase our pulp from
	several qualified suppliers in an attempt to mitigate price increases and supply interruptions

</DIV>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT; MARGIN-TOP: 6PT">
	We expect our average price for cement to remain relatively flat compared to fiscal year 2009. We
	continue to look for opportunities to negotiate lower prices with our cement suppliers in some
	markets and continue to evaluate opportunities to increase our supplier base.
</DIV>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT; MARGIN-TOP: 6PT">
	Freight costs increased in fiscal year 2009 due to high fuel rates and shifts in product mix. Based
	on data from the Energy Information Administration, we expect freight costs in fiscal year 2010 to
	decrease based on lower fuel costs and a more efficient supply chain.

	The collective impact of the foregoing factors, and other factors, including those identified in
	Item&nbsp;3, &#147;Key Information &#151; Risk Factors,&#148; may materially adversely affect our ability to generate
	sufficient cash flows from operations to meet our short and longer-term capital requirements. We
	believe that we will be able to fund any cash shortfalls for at least the next 12&nbsp;months with cash
	that we anticipate will be available under our credit facilities and that we will be able to
	maintain sufficient cash available under those facilities. Additionally, we may decide that it is
	necessary to continue to suspend dividend payments, scale back or postpone our expansion plans
	and/or take other measures to conserve cash to maintain sufficient capital resources over the short
	and longer-term.

<DIV ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT; MARGIN-TOP: 6PT">
	In its January&nbsp;2009 issue of The National Outlook, the NAHB baseline housing forecast shows large
	declines for new-home sales and housing starts for 2009 as a whole, with production coming in at
	the lowest level of the entire post-World War II period. However, the NAHB expects housing activity
	to stabilize around the middle of the calendar year, at least in the single-family sector, followed
	by a relatively slow recovery process later this year and in 2010 as a remaining supply overhang
	and serious constraints on credit for housing production drag out the long climb back to
	demographically-based trend levels of housing starts.

<DIV ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT; MARGIN-TOP: 6PT">
	The outlook for the U.S. residential repair and remodel market is also unclear, but is expected to
	weaken affected by a fall in housing values and subsequent reduction in owners&#146; equity. The repair
	and remodel sector is now estimated to represent more than 50% of our U.S. business.
</DIV>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT; MARGIN-TOP: 6PT">
	Housing starts in Australia are expected to continue to fall in 2009-2010. Activity in medium
	density dwellings and renovations may provide some growth and may partially offset the overall
	housing market decline.
</DIV>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT; MARGIN-TOP: 6PT">
	Residential housing consents in New Zealand are at a 25-year low and the commercial market, while
	more buoyant, is showing signs of weakening, although we are achieving good penetration with
	differentiated products. Housing affordability is expected to remain under pressure with increased
	building costs. Fiscal year 2010 is expected to see sales demand continue below last year&#146;s levels,
	although this may be partially offset partially by the release of new products.

	NYSE rules require each issuer to have an audit committee, a compensation committee
	(equivalent to a remuneration committee) and a nominating committee composed entirely
	of independent directors. As a foreign private issuer, we do not have to comply with
	this requirement. In our case, the charters of our Board Committees reflect Australian
	and Dutch practices, in that we have a majority of independent directors on these
	committees, unless a higher number is mandatory. Notwithstanding this difference, our
	Supervisory Board has determined that all of the current members of our Audit

<DIV ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT; MARGIN-TOP: 6PT">

	exercise price per share equal to A$8.53 to the Managing Board directors under the Managing Board
	Transitional Stock Option Plan. As set out in the plan rules, the exercise price and the number of
	shares available on exercise may be adjusted on the occurrence of certain events, including new
	issues, share splits, rights issues and capital reconstructions. Fifty percent of these options
	become exercisable on the first business day on or after November&nbsp;22, 2008 if the total shareholder
	returns (which we refer to as TSR) (essentially our dividend yield and common stock performance)
	from November&nbsp;22, 2005 to that date were at least equal to the median TSR for the companies
	comprising our peer group, as set out in the plan. In addition, for each 1% increment that our TSR
	is above the median TSR, an additional 2% of the options become exercisable. If any options remain
	unvested on the last business day of each six month period following November&nbsp;22, 2008 and November

	Our Remuneration Committee administers the 2001 Equity Incentive Plan. Subject to the provisions of

	participate in the 2001 Equity Incentive Plan, the number and types of awards made to each
	participant and the terms, conditions and limitations applicable to each award. In addition, our
	Remuneration Committee will have the exclusive power to interpret the 2001 Equity Incentive Plan
	and to adopt such rules and regulations as it deems necessary or appropriate for purposes of
	administering the 2001 Equity Incentive Plan. Subject to certain limitations, our Remuneration

	Under the 2001 Equity Incentive Plan, our Remuneration Committee is authorized to

	as may be determined by our Remuneration Committee, but no
	stock option may be exercised after 10&nbsp;years from the date of grant. Options may be exercisable in
	installments and upon such other terms as determined by our Remuneration Committee. Options are
	evidenced by notices of option grants authorized by our Remuneration Committee. No option is
	transferable other than by will or by the laws of descent and distribution or pursuant to certain

	Performance Awards.
</I>
	Our Remuneration Committee, in its discretion, may award performance awards to
	an eligible person contingent on the attainment of criteria specified by our Remuneration
	Committee. Performance awards are paid in the form of cash, shares of common stock or a combination
	of both. Our Remuneration Committee determines the total number of performance shares subject to an

</DIV>

	Restricted Stock Awards.
</I>
	Our Remuneration Committee may award restricted shares of common stock,
	which are subject to forfeiture under such conditions and for such periods of time as our
	Remuneration Committee may determine. Restricted shares may not be sold, transferred, assigned,
	pledged or otherwise encumbered so long as such shares remain restricted. Our Remuneration
	Committee determines the conditions or restrictions of any restricted stock awards, which may
	include requirements of continued employment, individual performance or our financial performance

<I>
	Stock Appreciation Rights.
</I>
	Remuneration Committee also may award stock appreciation rights either
	in tandem with an option or alone. Stock appreciation rights granted in tandem with a stock option
	may be granted at the same time as the stock option or at a later time. A stock appreciation right
	entitles the participant to receive from us an amount payable in cash, in shares of common stock or
	in a combination of cash and common stock, equal to the positive difference between the fair market
	value of a share of common stock on the date of exercise and the grant price, or such lesser amount

	the issue of restricted stock units. Restricted stock units are unfunded and unsecured contractual
	entitlements for shares to be issued in the future and may be subject to time vesting or
	performance hurdles prior to vesting. On vesting, restricted stock units convert into shares. We
	granted 1,690,711 restricted stock units under this plan in the year ended March&nbsp;31, 2009. As of
	March&nbsp;31, 2009, there were 1,440,930 restricted stock units outstanding under this plan.

	Our Remuneration Committee may award other benefits that, by their

	to a specified number of shares of our common stock or other securities, including but not limited

	who are members of our Supervisory Board as of the effective date of the 2001 Equity Incentive
	Plan, or individuals who became members of our Supervisory Board after the effective date of the
	2001 Equity Incentive Plan whose election or nomination for election was approved by at least a
	majority of such individuals (or, in the case of directors nominated by a person, entity or group
	with 20% of our voting securities, by two-thirds of such individuals) cease to constitute being at
	least a majority of the members of our Supervisory Board, or (3)&nbsp;there occurs the consummation of
	certain mergers (other than a merger that results in existing voting securities continuing to

<DIV ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT; MARGIN-TOP: 6PT">
	Participation by members of the Supervisory Board in the Supervisory Board Share Plan is not
	mandatory. Under the Supervisory Board Share Plan, the Supervisory Board members can elect to
	receive some of their annual fees in the form of shares/CUFS. This is different from the old
	Supervisory Board Share Plan under which Supervisory Board members were required to contribute a
	portion of their annual fees in shares/CUFS. As of March&nbsp;31, 2009, 79,342 shares had been acquired
	under this plan.
</DIV>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT; MARGIN-TOP: 6PT">
	Shares/CUFS received under the Supervisory Board Share Plan can be either issued or acquired on the
	open market. Where shares/CUFS are issued, the price is the average of the market closing prices at
	which CUFS were quoted to the ASX during the five business days preceding the day of issue. Where
	shares/CUFS are acquired on the open market, the price is the purchase price.
</DIV>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT; MARGIN-TOP: 6PT">
	The Supervisory Board Share Plan does not include a performance condition because the amounts
	applied to acquire shares/CUFS under the Supervisory Board Share Plan are from the annual fees
	earned by the Supervisory Board directors.

	shareholders also approved, in accordance with certain LTIP rules, the issue of certain options or
	other rights over, or interest in, shares, the issue and/or transfer of shares under them, and the
	grant of cash awards to members of our Managing Board and executives. At our 2008 AGM, our
	shareholders amended the LTIP to also allow restricted stock units to be granted under the LTIP. In
	August&nbsp;2007 and November&nbsp;2006, 1,016,000 options and 1,132,000 options, and in September&nbsp;2008,
	December&nbsp;2008 and May&nbsp;2009, 1,023,865, 545,757 and 1,066,595 restricted stock units, respectively,
	were granted under the LTIP to our Managing Board and to certain members of our management,
	respectively. The vesting of these equity awards are subject to &#147;performance hurdles&#148; as outlined
	in the LTIP rules. Unexercised options expire 10&nbsp;years from the date of issue and restricted stock
	units expire on exercise, vesting or as set out in the LTIP rules. As of May&nbsp;31, 2009, there were
	2,148,000 options and 2,616,726 restricted stock units outstanding under this plan.

	Effect of Change in Control, Takeover by Certain Organizations or Liquidation

	. The LTIP provides
	for plan participants&#146; early exercise of certain benefits or early payout under the plan in the
	event of a &#147;change in control,&#148; takeover by certain organizations or liquidation. For options, a
	&#147;change in control&#148; is deemed to have occurred if pursuant to a takeover bid or otherwise, any
	person together with their associates acquire shares, which when aggregated with shares already
	acquired by such person and their associates, comprise more than 30% of our issued shares. For
	restricted stock units, a &#147;change of control&#148; is deemed to occur if (1)&nbsp;a takeover bid is made to
	acquire all of the shares of the Company and it is recommended by the Supervisory Board or becomes
	unconditional, (2)&nbsp;a transaction is announced which would result in one person owning all the
	issued shares in the Company, (3)&nbsp;a person owns or controls sufficient shares to enable them to
	influence the composition of the Supervisory Board, or (4)&nbsp;a similar transaction occurs which the
	Supervisory Board determines to be a control event. On a change of control, the Supervisory Board
	can determine that all or some restricted stock units have vested on any conditions it determines.
	Any remaining restricted stock units lapse.

	During fiscal year 2008, we maintained an Economic Profit and Individual Performance Incentive Plan

<DIV ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT; MARGIN-TOP: 6PT">
	After carefully assessing the senior executives&#146; response to and performance in the extreme market
	conditions facing the entire housing industry in the United States, the Supervisory Board concluded
	that executives&#146; performance was of such a standard that in this instance, an exceptional
	discretionary bonus was justified, and implemented the one-off Deferred Bonus Program in June&nbsp;2008.
</DIV>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT; MARGIN-TOP: 6PT">
	Payments under this plan comprised of a cash payment equal to one third of the total value
	(short-term incentive) and a grant of two year vesting restricted stock units equal to two thirds
	of the value (long-term incentive) in June&nbsp;2008. The total value of cash and restricted stock units
	under the Deferred Bonus Program was 75% of the short-term incentive target in fiscal year 2008,
	which therefore included an amount equal to 75% of the bonus bank the senior executive had
	accumulated for the Company&#146;s good performance in fiscal years 2006 and 2007.
</DIV>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT; MARGIN-TOP: 6PT">
	Restricted stock units are unfunded and unsecured contractual entitlements for shares to be issued
	in the future. The restricted stock units granted in respect of the Deferred Bonus
	Program vest and convert into shares on a one-for-one basis in two years if the
	senior executive has maintained a satisfactory level of performance during this period, subject to
	exceptions based on the reasons for the recipient&#146;s departure and other specified corporate events.

	securities of the issuer while in possession of inside, non-public information and from passing on
	inside information or recommending a transaction while in possession of inside information. Similar
	provisions apply under Australian law, where persons are prohibited from trading on the basis of
	information which is not generally available and which, if it were generally available, a
	reasonable person would expect to have a material effect on the price or value of securities.
	Similarly, in the United States, persons are prohibited from trading on the basis of material,
	non-public information. We have adopted an internal code on insider trading consistent with Dutch,

	Each shareholder, person entitled to vote and CUFS holder (but not an ADS holder) has the right to
	attend general meetings of shareholders, either in person or by proxy, to address shareholder
	meetings and, in the case of shareholders and other persons entitled to vote (for instance, certain
	pledge holders), to exercise voting rights, subject to the provisions of our Articles of
	Association. As described in the paragraph below, although ADS holders cannot vote directly, they
	can direct the voting of their underlying shares through the ADS depositary. Meetings of
	shareholders are held in The Netherlands at least annually, within six months after the close of
	each of our fiscal years. These meetings take place in either Amsterdam, The Hague, Rotterdam or
	Haarlemmermeer (Schiphol Airport). Additional meetings of shareholders may be held as often as our
	Managing Board or our Supervisory Board deems necessary or if called by (1)&nbsp;holders of shares of
	common stock jointly representing at least 5% of our issued share capital, or (2)&nbsp;at least 100
	holders of shares of common stock or one shareholder representing at least 100 CUFS holders or any
	relevant combination thereof so that the request of at least 100 persons is taken into account. Our

	Australia prior to each general meeting.
</DIV>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT; MARGIN-TOP: 6PT">
	We give notice of each meeting of shareholders by mail and by way of an announcement in a
	nationally distributed newspaper in The Netherlands. Such notice is given no later than the 28th
	day prior to the day of the meeting and includes or is accompanied by an agenda identifying the
	business to be considered at the meeting. We currently are exempt from the proxy rules under the
	Exchange Act. Holders of shares of common stock represented by CUFS are provided notice of general
	meetings of shareholders and other communications with shareholders by us, and the ADS depositary,
	The Bank of New York, provides our ADS holders with such notices and communications. CHESS
	Depositary Nominees Pty Ltd, or CDN, or we on behalf of CDN, may deliver to CUFS holders
	instruction forms allowing the CUFS holders to instruct CDN how to vote at a meeting. Similarly,
	the ADS depositary may deliver to ADS holders instruction forms allowing the ADS holders to direct
	the ADS depositary on how to instruct CDN to vote at a meeting. In order for CUFS holders to attend
	general meetings of shareholders in person, such holders need not withdraw the shares of common
	stock represented by the CUFS, but must follow such rules and procedures as may be established by
	the CUFS Subregistrar and our share registry. CUFS holders may request CDN to appoint them as proxy
	for the purposes of voting the shares underlying their holding of CUFS on behalf of CDN. In order
	for ADS holders to attend general meetings of shareholders in person, such holders will have to
	convert their ADSs

	Subject to certain exceptions, our Articles of Association prohibit the holding of shares of our
	common stock if, because of an acquisition of a relevant interest (including in the form of shares
	of our common stock, CUFS or ADSs) in such shares: (1)&nbsp;the number of shares of our common stock in

	control over the Company takes place in an efficient, competitive and informed market; (2)&nbsp;the

	enable them to assess the merits of the proposal and (3)&nbsp;as far as practicable, the holders of the
	shares of our common stock or CUFS, among others, all have a reasonable and equal opportunity to
	participate in any benefits accruing to the holders through any proposal under which a person would
	acquire a substantial interest in the Company. The exceptions to this prohibition set forth in our

	Finally, shareholders are subject to beneficial ownership reporting disclosure requirements under

	applies to all holders of our shares of common stock, ADSs or CUFS because our securities have been
	registered with the SEC. The number of shares of common stock underlying ADSs and CUFS is used to
	determine whether a person beneficially owns more than 5% of the class of securities. This

	Treatment of ADSs.
</I>
	For U.S. federal income tax purposes, a holder of an ADS is considered the owner

<I>
	Taxation of Distributions.
</I>
	Subject to the passive foreign investment company rules discussed below,
	the tax treatment of a distribution on shares of our common stock held by a U.S. Shareholder
	depends on whether the distribution is from our current or accumulated earnings and profits (as
	determined under U.S. federal income tax principles). To the extent a distribution is from our
	current or accumulated earnings and profits, a U.S. Shareholder will include the amount of the
	distribution in gross income as a dividend. To the extent a distribution exceeds our current and
	accumulated earnings and profits, a U.S. Shareholder will treat the excess first as a non-taxable
	return of capital to the extent of the U.S. Shareholder&#146;s tax basis in those shares and thereafter
	as capital gain. See the discussion of &#147;Capital Gain Rates&#148; below. Notwithstanding the foregoing
	described treatment, we do not intend to maintain calculations of our current and accumulated
	earnings and profits. Dividends received on shares of our common stock will not qualify for the
	inter-corporate dividends received deduction.
</DIV>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT; MARGIN-TOP: 6PT">
	Distributions to U.S. Shareholders that are treated as dividends may be subject to a reduced rate
	of tax under recently enacted U.S. tax laws. For taxable years beginning after December&nbsp;31, 2002
	and before January&nbsp;1, 2011, &#147;qualified dividend income&#148; is subject to a maximum tax rate of 15%.
	&#147;Qualified dividend income&#148; includes dividends received from a &#147;qualified foreign corporation.&#148; A
	&#147;qualified foreign corporation&#148; includes (1)&nbsp;a foreign corporation that is eligible for the
	benefits of a comprehensive income tax treaty with the United States that contains an exchange of
	information program and (2)&nbsp;a foreign corporation that pays dividends with respect to shares of its
	stock that are readily tradable on an established securities market in the United States. We
	believe that we are, and will continue to be, a &#147;qualified foreign corporation&#148; and that dividends
	we pay with respect to our shares will qualify as &#147;qualified dividend income.&#148; To be eligible for
	the 15% tax rate, a U.S. Shareholder must hold our shares un-hedged for a minimum holding period
	(generally, 61&nbsp;days during the 121-day period beginning on the date that is 60&nbsp;days before the
	ex-dividend date of the distribution). Although we believe we presently are, and will continue to
	be, a &#147;qualified foreign corporation,&#148; we cannot guarantee that we will so qualify. For example, we
	will not constitute a &#147;qualified foreign corporation&#148; if we are classified as a &#147;passive foreign
	investment company&#148; (discussed below) in either the taxable year of the distribution or the
	preceding taxable year.

	Distributions to U.S. Shareholders that are treated as dividends are generally considered income
	from sources outside the United States and, for purposes of computing the limitations on foreign
	tax credits that apply separately to specific categories of income, foreign source &#147;passive
	category&#148; income or, in the case of certain holders, &#147;general category&#148; income. However, if United
	States persons own, directly or indirectly, 50% or more of our shares of common stock, then a
	portion of the dividends (based on the portion of our earnings and profits that is from U.S.
	sources) may be treated as sourced within the United States. This 50% ownership rule could
	potentially limit a U.S.

	its U.S. dollar value on the date of receipt and will recognize ordinary U.S. source gain or loss
	when it sells or exchanges the foreign currency. U.S. Shareholders who are individuals will not
	recognize gain upon selling or exchanging foreign currency if the gain does not exceed $200 in a
	taxable year and the sale or exchange constitutes a &#147;personal transaction&#148; under the Code. The
	amount of any distribution we make with respect to shares of our common stock in property other

</I>
	Under certain conditions, including a requirement to hold shares
	of our common stock un-hedged for a certain period, and subject to limitations, a U.S. Shareholder
	may claim a credit against the U.S. Shareholder&#146;s federal income tax liability for the foreign tax
	owed and withheld or paid with respect to distributions on our shares. Alternatively, a U.S.
	Shareholder may deduct the amount of withheld foreign taxes, but only for a year for which the U.S.
	Shareholder elects to deduct all foreign income taxes. Complex rules determine how and when the
	foreign tax credit applies, and U.S. Shareholders should consult their tax advisers to determine
	whether and to what extent they may claim foreign tax credits.
</DIV>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT; MARGIN-TOP: 6PT">
	Under certain conditions, we may retain a portion of Dutch taxes we withhold from dividends paid to
	our shareholders, rather than pay that portion of the withheld taxes to The Dutch Tax
	Administration. Uncertainty exists whether a U.S. Shareholder can properly claim as a foreign tax
	credit any Netherlands withholding taxes we retain. As a result, U.S. Shareholders should consult
	their tax advisers regarding their ability to do so. If unable to claim a foreign tax credit for
	those taxes, a U.S. Shareholder still may deduct them for U.S. federal income tax purposes, but
	only in a year in which the U.S. Shareholder elects to deduct all foreign income taxes. The
	conditions under which we could retain Netherlands withholding taxes are unlikely to occur, but
	upon request, we will inform U.S. Shareholders whether we retained any Dutch tax withheld from
	distributions on shares of our common stock.

<DIV ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT; MARGIN-TOP: 6PT">
<I>
	Sale or Other Disposition of Shares.
</I>
	Subject to the passive foreign investment company rules
	discussed below, a U.S. Shareholder will recognize capital gain or loss on the sale or other
	taxable disposition of shares of our common stock, equal to the difference between the U.S.
	Shareholder&#146;s adjusted tax basis in the shares sold or disposed of and the amount realized on the
	sale or disposition. Individual U.S. Shareholders may benefit from lower marginal tax rates on
	capital gains recognized on shares sold, depending on the U.S. Shareholder&#146;s holding period for the
	shares. See the discussion of &#147;Capital Gain Rates&#148; below. Capital losses that do not offset capital
	gains are subject to limitations on deductibility. The gain or loss from the sale or other
	disposition of shares of our common stock generally will be treated as income from sources within
	the United States for foreign tax credit purposes, unless the U.S. Shareholder is a U.S. citizen
	residing outside the United States and certain other conditions are met.
</DIV>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT; MARGIN-TOP: 6PT">
<I>
	Capital Gain Rates.
</I>
	For individual U.S. Shareholders, the tax rates applicable to capital gain and
	ordinary income may vary substantially. For calendar year 2008, the highest marginal income tax
	rate that could apply to the ordinary income of an individual U.S. Shareholder (disregarding the
	effect of limitations on deductions) was 35%. In contrast, a maximum rate of 15% applied to any net
	capital gain of an individual U.S. Shareholder if that gain was attributable to the sale or
	exchange of capital assets held more than one year. Gain attributable to the sale or exchange of
	capital assets held one year or less is short-term capital gain, taxable at the same rates as
	ordinary income. In addition, a maximum rate of 15% applies to &#147;qualified dividend income&#148; (as
	described above).

<DIV ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT; MARGIN-TOP: 6PT">
<I>
	Passive Foreign Investment Company Status.
</I>
	Special U.S. federal income tax rules apply to U.S.
	Shareholders owning capital stock of a PFIC. A foreign corporation will be a PFIC for any taxable
	year in which 75% or more of its gross income is passive income or in which 50% or more of the
	average value of its assets is &#147;passive assets&#148; (generally assets that generate passive income or
	assets held for the production of passive income). For these purposes, passive income excludes
	certain interest, dividends or royalties from related parties.

	any gain realized on a sale, exchange or other disposition of the shares unless the dividends or
	gain is effectively connected with the conduct by the Non-U.S. Shareholder of trade or business in
	the United States (and is attributable to a permanent establishment or fixed base the Non-U.S.
	Shareholder maintains in the United States if an applicable income tax treaty so requires as a
	condition for the Non-U.S. Shareholder to be subject to U.S. taxation on a net income basis on
	income related to the common stock). A corporate Non-U.S. Shareholder under certain circumstances
	may also be subject to an additional &#147;branch profits tax&#148; on that type of income, the rate of which
	may be reduced pursuant to an applicable income tax treaty. In addition, gain recognized on a sale,

<DIV ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT; MARGIN-TOP: 6PT">
	We are exposed to changes in prices of commodities used in our operations, primarily associated
	with energy, fuel and raw materials such as pulp and cement. Pulp has historically demonstrated
	more price sensitivity than other raw materials that we use in our manufacturing process. In
	addition, fuel and cement prices rose in fiscal years 2007 and 2008, but declined in fiscal year
	2009. We expect that pulp, energy, fuel and cement prices will continue to fluctuate in the near
	future. To minimize the additional working capital requirements caused by rising prices related to
	these commodities, we have entered into contracts that discount pulp prices in relation to various
	pulp indices over a longer-term and purchase our pulp from several qualified suppliers in an
	attempt to mitigate price increases and supply interruptions. However, if such commodity prices do
	not continue to rise, our cost of sales may be negatively impacted due to fixed pricing over the
	longer-term. We have assessed the market risk for pulp and believe that, a $72 per metric ton
	movement in market pulp prices, which represents approximately 10% of the market pulp price at
	March&nbsp;31, 2009, would have had approximately a 0.7% change in our cost of sales in fiscal year
	2009. We have also assessed the market risk for cement and believe that, a $10 per metric ton price
	movement in cement prices, which represents approximately 10% of the market cement price at March
	31, 2009, would have had approximately a 0.4% change in cost of sales in fiscal year 2009.

	The Board of Directors and Shareholders of James Hardie Industries N.V.:
</DIV>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT; MARGIN-TOP: 6PT">
	We have audited James Hardie Industries N.V.&#146;s internal control over financial reporting as of
	March&nbsp;31, 2009, based on criteria established in Internal Control&#151;Integrated Framework issued by
	the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (the COSO criteria). James
	Hardie Industries N.V.&#146;s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over
	financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial
	reporting included in the accompanying Management&#146;s Report on Internal Control over Financial
	Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company&#146;s internal control over
	financial reporting based on our audit.
</DIV>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT; MARGIN-TOP: 6PT">
	We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
	Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
	reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was
	maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal
	control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and
	evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk,
	and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe
	that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
</DIV>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT; MARGIN-TOP: 6PT">
	A company&#146;s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable
	assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial
	statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A
	company&#146;s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1)
	pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the
	transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2)&nbsp;provide reasonable assurance that
	transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance
	with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
	are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company;
	and (3)&nbsp;provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized
	acquisition, use or disposition of the company&#146;s assets that could have a material effect on the
	financial statements.
</DIV>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT; MARGIN-TOP: 6PT">
	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or
	detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are
	subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that
	the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

	In our opinion, James Hardie Industries N.V. maintained, in all material respects, effective

	Under the NYSE listing standards applicable to U.S. companies, if a member of an audit committee

	We seek to maintain high standards of integrity and we are committed to ensuring that we conduct
	our business in accordance with high standards of ethical behavior. We require our employees to
	comply with the spirit and the letter of all laws and other statutory requirements governing the
	conduct of our activities in each country in which we operate. Our Code of Business Conduct and
	Ethics applies to all of our employees and directors. The Code of Business Conduct and Ethics
	covers many aspects of our policy that governs compliance with legal and other responsibilities to
	stakeholders. All of our directors and employees worldwide are reminded annually of the existence
	of the Code of Business Conduct and Ethics and asked to confirm that they have read it. During
	fiscal year 2009, the Audit Committee approved updates to the Code of Business Conduct and Ethics
	based on a review of best practices.
</DIV>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT; MARGIN-TOP: 6PT">
	Our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics policy provides employees with advice about who they should
	contact if they have information or questions regarding violations of the policy. We have a
	telephone Ethics Hotline operated by an independent external provider which allows employees to
	report anonymously any concerns. All of our employees worldwide are reminded annually of the
	existence of the Ethics Hotline. Our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics policy prohibits any
	employee from retaliating or taking any adverse action against anyone for raising or helping to
	resolve a concern about integrity.
</DIV>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT; MARGIN-TOP: 6PT">
	During fiscal year 2009, the Audit Committee conducted a review of the operation of our Ethics
	Hotline and complaint reporting processes to assess the nature and number of complaints submitted,
	in particular to review fraud and accounting related complaints while maintaining overall
	visibility to complaints of any other nature. Following its review, the complaint reporting
	process was revised so that all complaints, whether to the Ethics Hotline or otherwise, are
	initially reported directly to the General Counsel and Director of Internal Audit (except in cases
	where the complaint refers to one of them). The timing of when the Audit Committee receives the
	reports depends on the severity of the complaints, with the most serious complaints referred
	immediately to the Chairman of the Audit Committee and Supervisory Board and less serious
	complaints reported to the Audit Committee on a quarterly basis and at different levels of detail,
	depending on the nature of the complaint. Our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics policy prohibits
	any employee from retaliating or taking any adverse action against anyone for raising or helping to
	resolve concern about integrity.

	will be set forth in a separate document requesting Audit Committee approval in advance of the

	firm. We obtain these services from other service providers as needed.

	On July&nbsp;2, 1998, ABN 60 000 009 263 Pty Ltd, formerly James Hardie Industries Limited (&#147;JHIL&#148;),
	then a public company organized under the laws of Australia and listed on the Australian Stock
	Exchange, announced a plan of reorganization and capital restructuring (the &#147;1998 Reorganization&#148;).
	James Hardie N.V. (&#147;JHNV&#148;) was incorporated in August&nbsp;1998, as an intermediary holding company,
	with all of its common stock owned by indirect subsidiaries of JHIL. On October&nbsp;16, 1998, JHIL&#146;s
	shareholders approved the 1998 Reorganization. Effective as of November&nbsp;1, 1998, JHIL contributed
	its fiber cement businesses, its U.S. gypsum wallboard business, its Australian and New Zealand
	building systems businesses and its Australian windows business (collectively, the &#147;Transferred
	Businesses&#148;) to JHNV and its subsidiaries. In connection with the 1998 Reorganization, JHIL and its
	non-transferring subsidiaries retained certain unrelated assets and liabilities.

	On July&nbsp;24, 2001, JHIL announced a further plan of reorganization and capital restructuring (the
	&#147;2001 Reorganization&#148;). Completion of the 2001 Reorganization occurred on October&nbsp;19, 2001. In
	connection with the 2001 Reorganization, James Hardie Industries N.V. (&#147;JHI NV&#148;), formerly RCI
	Netherlands Holdings B.V., issued common shares represented by CHESS Units of Foreign Securities
	(&#147;CUFS&#148;) on a one for one basis to existing JHIL shareholders in exchange for their shares in JHIL
	such that JHI NV became the new ultimate holding company for JHIL and JHNV.

	The consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles
	generally accepted in the United States of America (&#147;U.S. GAAP&#148;). The U.S. dollar is used as the
	reporting currency. All subsidiaries and special purpose entities are consolidated and all

	Use of Estimates
</I>
</B>
</DIV>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT; MARGIN-TOP: 6PT">
	The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make
	estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets
	and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the
	financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting
	period. Actual results could differ from these estimates.

	effects of foreign currency translation adjustments are included directly in other comprehensive

	Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market. Cost is generally determined under the
	first-in, first-out method, except that the cost of raw materials and supplies is determined using
	actual or average costs. Cost includes the costs of materials, labor and applied factory overhead.
	On a regular basis, the Company evaluates its inventory balances for excess quantities and
	obsolescence by analyzing demand, inventory on hand, sales levels and other information. Based on

	The costs of additions and improvements are capitalized, while maintenance and repair costs are
	expensed as incurred. Interest is capitalized in connection with the construction of major
	facilities. Capitalized interest is recorded as part of the asset to which it relates and is
	amortized over the asset&#146;s estimated useful life. Retirements, sales and disposals of assets are
	recorded by removing the cost and accumulated depreciation amounts with any resulting gain or loss

	In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (&#147;SFAS&#148;) No.&nbsp;143, &#147;Accounting for

	period in which the liability is incurred. The initial measurement of an asset retirement

	long-lived assets, such as property, plant and equipment, and purchased intangibles subject to
	amortization are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that
	the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and
	used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to estimated undiscounted
	future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If the carrying amount of the asset
	exceeds its estimated future cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized by the amount by which
	the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the assets.

	operations, and which do not contribute to current or future revenue generation, are expensed.
	Liabilities are recorded when environmental assessments and/or remedial efforts are probable and
	the costs can be reasonably estimated. Estimated liabilities are not discounted to present value.
	Generally, the timing of these accruals coincides with completion of a feasibility study or the

	Upon shareholder approval of the Amended FFA, in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards

	in a separate recognition of the asbestos liability and certain other items including the related
	Australian income tax benefit. Among other items, the Company recorded a deferred tax asset for the
	anticipated tax benefit related to asbestos liabilities and a corresponding increase in the
	asbestos liability. As stated in &#147;Deferred Income Taxes&#148; below, James Hardie 117 Pty Ltd (the
	&#147;Performing Subsidiary&#148;) will be able to claim a taxable deduction for contributions to the
	asbestos fund. For the year ended March&nbsp;31, 2007, the Company classified the expense related to the

	shares in the Former James Hardie Companies were transferred to the AICF. The Company appoints
	three of the AICF directors and the NSW state government appoints two of the AICF directors. The

	vary based upon the annual actuarial assessments obtained by the AICF with respect to
	asbestos-related personal injury claims against the Former James Hardie Companies. Due to the
	Company&#146;s variable interest in the AICF, it consolidates the AICF in accordance with FASB,

	the terms of the Amended FFA. These items are Australian dollar-denominated and are subject to

</DIV>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT; MARGIN-TOP: 6PT">
	The amount of the asbestos liability reflects the terms of the Amended FFA, which has been
	calculated by reference to (but is not exclusively based upon) the most recent actuarial estimate
	of projected future cash flows prepared by KPMG Actuaries. Based on KPMG Actuaries&#146; assumptions,
	KPMG Actuaries arrived at a range of possible total cash flows and proposed a central estimate
	which is intended to reflect an expected outcome. The Company views the central estimate as the
	basis for recording the asbestos liability in the Company&#146;s financial statements, which under U.S.
	GAAP, it considers the best estimate under SFAS No.&nbsp;5. The asbestos liability includes these cash
	flows as undiscounted and uninflated on the basis that it is inappropriate to discount or inflate
	future cash flows when the timing and amounts of such cash flows is not fixed or readily
	determinable.
</DIV>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT; MARGIN-TOP: 6PT">
	Adjustments in the asbestos liability due to changes in the actuarial estimate of projected future
	cash flows and changes in the estimate of future operating costs of the AICF are reflected in the
	consolidated statements of operations during the period in which they occur. Claims paid by the
	AICF and claims-handling costs incurred by the AICF are treated as reductions in the accrued
	balances previously reflected in the consolidated balance sheets.

	credit risk based on credit agency ratings. The insurance receivable generally includes these cash
	flows as undiscounted and uninflated on the basis that it is inappropriate to discount or inflate
	future cash flows when the timing and amounts of such cash flows are not fixed or readily
	determinable. The Company only records insurance receivables that it deems to be probable.

	Credit facilities as of March&nbsp;31, 2009 consist of 364-day facilities in the amount of $68.3
	million, which as of March&nbsp;31, 2009, mature in June&nbsp;2009. The Company is aware that $51.6&nbsp;million
	of this amount will not be extended. The remaining $16.7&nbsp;million of these credit facilities has
	been extended to June&nbsp;2010.
</DIV>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT; MARGIN-TOP: 6PT">
	For all facilities, the interest rate is calculated two business days prior to the commencement of
	each draw-down period based on the US$ London Interbank Offered Rate (&#147;LIBOR&#148;) plus the margins of
	individual lenders and is
	payable at the end of each draw-down period. At March&nbsp;31, 2009, there was $324.0&nbsp;million drawn
	under the combined facilities and $174.3&nbsp;million was available.
</DIV>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT; MARGIN-TOP: 6PT">
	At March&nbsp;31, 2009, management believes that the Company was in compliance with all restrictive
	covenants contained in its credit facility agreements. Under the most restrictive of these
	covenants, the Company (i)&nbsp;is required to maintain certain ratios of indebtedness to equity which
	do not exceed certain maximums, excluding assets, liabilities and other balance sheet items of the
	AICF, Amaba, Amaca, ABN 60 and Marlew Mining Pty Limited, (ii)&nbsp;must maintain a minimum level of net
	worth, excluding assets, liabilities and other balance sheet items of the AICF; for these purposes
	&#147;net worth&#148; means the sum of the par value (or value stated in the books of the James Hardie Group)
	of the capital stock (but excluding treasury stock and capital stock subscribed or unissued) of the
	James Hardie Group, the paid in capital and retained earnings of the James Hardie Group and the
	aggregate amount of provisions made by the James Hardie Group for asbestos related liabilities, in
	each case, as such amounts would be shown in the consolidated balance sheet of the James Hardie
	Group if Amaba, Amaca, ABN 60 and Marlew Mining Pty Limited were not accounted for as subsidiaries
	of the Company, (iii)&nbsp;must meet or exceed a minimum ratio of earnings before interest and taxes to
	net interest charges, excluding all income, expense and other profit and loss statement impacts of
	the AICF, Amaba, Amaca, ABN 60 and Marlew Mining Pty Limited and (iv)&nbsp;must ensure that no more than
	35% of Free Cash Flow (as defined in the Amended FFA) in any given Financial Year is contributed to
	the AICF on the payment dates under the Amended Final Funding Agreement in the next following
	Financial Year. The limit does not apply to payments of interest to the AICF. Such limits are
	consistent with the contractual liabilities of the Performing Subsidiary and the Company under the
	Amended FFA.

</B>
</DIV>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT; MARGIN-TOP: 6PT">
	The Company offers various warranties on its products, including a 50-year limited warranty on
	certain of its fiber cement siding products in the United States. A typical warranty program
	requires the Company to replace defective products within a specified time period from the date of
	sale. The Company records an estimate for future warranty related costs based on an analysis of
	actual historical warranty costs as they relate to sales. Based on this analysis and other factors,
	the adequacy of the Company&#146;s warranty provisions is adjusted as necessary. While the Company&#146;s
	warranty costs have historically been within its calculated estimates, it is possible that future
	warranty costs could differ from those estimates.
</DIV>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT; MARGIN-TOP: 6PT">
	Additionally, the Company includes in its accrual for product warranties amounts for a Class&nbsp;Action
	Settlement Agreement (the &#147;Settlement Agreement&#148;) related to its previous roofing products, which
	are no longer manufactured in the United States. On February&nbsp;14, 2002, the Company signed the
	Settlement Agreement for all product, warranty and property related liability claims associated
	with these previously manufactured roofing products. These products were removed from the
	marketplace between 1995 and 1998 in areas where there had been any alleged problems. The total
	amount included in the product warranty provision relating to the Settlement Agreement is $1.9
	million and $2.7&nbsp;million as of March&nbsp;31, 2009 and 2008, respectively.

	The amount of the asbestos liability reflects the terms of the Amended FFA, which has been

	of the projected future asbestos-related cash flows prepared by KPMG Actuaries. The asbestos
	liability also includes an allowance for the future claims-handling costs of the AICF. The Company
	receives an updated actuarial estimate as of March&nbsp;31 each year. The last actuarial assessment was
	performed as of March&nbsp;31, 2009.

	Actuarial Study; Claims Estimate
</I>
</B>
</DIV>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT; MARGIN-TOP: 6PT">
	The AICF commissioned an updated actuarial study of potential asbestos-related liabilities as of
	March&nbsp;31, 2009. Based on KPMG Actuaries&#146; assumptions, KPMG Actuaries arrived at a range of possible
	total cash flows and proposed a central estimate which is intended to reflect an expected outcome.
	The Company views the central estimate as the basis for recording the asbestos liability in the
	Company&#146;s financial statements, which under U.S. GAAP, it considers the best estimate under SFAS
	No.&nbsp;5. Based on the results of these studies, it is estimated that the discounted (but inflated)
	value of the central estimate for claims against the Former James Hardie Companies was
	approximately A$1.8&nbsp;billion ($1.2&nbsp;billion). The undiscounted (but inflated) value of the central
	estimate of the asbestos-related liabilities of Amaca and Amaba as determined by KPMG Actuaries was
	approximately A$3.1&nbsp;billion ($2.1&nbsp;billion). Actual liabilities of those companies for such claims
	could vary, perhaps materially, from the central estimate described above. The asbestos liability
	includes projected future cash flows as undiscounted and uninflated on the basis that it is
	inappropriate to discount or inflate future cash flows when the timing and amounts of such cash
	flows is not fixed or readily determinable.
</DIV>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT; MARGIN-TOP: 6PT">
	The asbestos liability has been revised to reflect the most recent actuarial estimate prepared by
	KPMG Actuaries as of March&nbsp;31, 2009 and to adjust for payments made to claimants during the year
	then ended.
</DIV>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT; MARGIN-TOP: 6PT">
	In estimating the potential financial exposure, KPMG Actuaries made assumptions related to the
	total number of claims which were reasonably estimated to be asserted through 2071, the typical
	cost of settlement (which is sensitive to, among other factors, the industry in which a plaintiff
	claims exposure, the alleged disease type and the jurisdiction in which the action is brought), the
	legal costs incurred in the litigation of such claims, the rate of receipt of claims, the
	settlement strategy in dealing with outstanding claims and the timing of settlements.
</DIV>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT; MARGIN-TOP: 6PT">
	Due to inherent uncertainties in the legal and medical environment, the number and timing of future
	claim notifications and settlements, the recoverability of claims against insurance contracts, and
	estimates of future trends in average claim awards, as well as the extent to which the above named
	entities will contribute to the overall settlements, the actual amount of liability could differ
	materially from that which is currently projected.
</DIV>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT; MARGIN-TOP: 6PT">
	The potential range of costs as estimated by KPMG Actuaries is affected by a number of variables
	such as nil settlement rates (where no settlement is payable by the Former James Hardie Companies
	because the claim settlement is borne by other asbestos defendants (other than the former James
	Hardie subsidiaries) which are held liable), peak year of claims, past history of claims numbers,
	average settlement rates, past history of Australian asbestos-related medical injuries, current
	number of claims, average defense and plaintiff legal costs, base wage inflation and superimposed
	inflation. The potential range of losses disclosed includes both asserted and unasserted claims.
	While no assurances can be provided, the Company believes that it is likely to be able to partially
	recover losses from various insurance carriers. As of March&nbsp;31, 2009, KPMG Actuaries&#146; undiscounted
	central estimate of asbestos-related liabilities was A$3.1&nbsp;billion ($2.1&nbsp;billion). This
	undiscounted (but inflated) central estimate is net of expected insurance recoveries of A$462.3
	million ($317.7&nbsp;million) after making a general credit risk allowance for bad debt insurance
	carriers and an allowance for A$83.5&nbsp;million ($57.4&nbsp;million) of &#147;by claim&#148; or subrogation
	recoveries from other third parties. In accordance with FIN 39, the Company has not netted the
	insurance receivable against the asbestos liability on its consolidated balance sheets.
</DIV>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT; MARGIN-TOP: 6PT">
	A sensitivity analysis has been performed to determine how the actuarial estimates would change if
	certain assumptions (i.e., the rate of inflation and superimposed inflation, the average costs of
	claims and legal fees, and the projected numbers of claims) were different from the assumptions
	used to determine the central estimates. This analysis shows that the discounted (but inflated)
	central estimates could be in a range of A$1.2&nbsp;billion ($0.8&nbsp;billion) to A$2.6&nbsp;billion ($1.8
	billion) (undiscounted, but inflated, estimates of A$1.9&nbsp;billion ($1.3&nbsp;billion) to A$5.5&nbsp;billion
	($3.8&nbsp;billion)), as of March&nbsp;31, 2009. It should be noted that the actual cost of the liabilities
	could be outside of that range depending on the results of actual experience relative to the
	assumptions made. One of the critical
	assumptions is the estimated peak year of mesothelioma disease claims which is targeted for
	2010/2011. Potential variation in this estimate has an impact much greater than the other
	sensitivities. If the peak year occurs five years later, in 2015/2016, the discounted central
	estimate could increase by approximately 50%.

	disclosure requirements about fair value measurements. SFAS No.&nbsp;157 defines fair value as the
	prices that would need to be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit
	price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly
	transaction between market participants on the measurement date. The fair value hierarchy

	Restricted short-term investments are held and managed by the AICF and are reported at their fair
	value. The fair value of these investments decreased $10.4&nbsp;million and $4.4&nbsp;million in the years
	ended March&nbsp;31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. At March&nbsp;31, 2008, the Company had recorded the $4.4
	million loss as unrealized and as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income.
	However, at March&nbsp;31, 2009, the Company determined these investments were other than temporarily
	impaired due to the current economic environment, the length of time the fair value of the assets
	were less than cost and the deepness of the discount of the fair value compared to the assets cost.
	The Company realized the entire $14.8&nbsp;million change in fair value as a loss on the Consolidated
	Statement of Operations within the line item

	For all of these interest rate swap contracts, the Company has agreed to pay fixed interest rates

<I>
	Indemnities
</I>
</DIV>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT; MARGIN-TOP: 6PT">
	As noted previously, the Company has entered into deeds of indemnity with certain of its directors
	and officers, as is common practice for publicly listed companies. The Company&#146;s articles of
	association also contain an indemnity for directors and officers. To date, claims for payments of
	expenses incurred have been received from certain former directors and officers in relation to the
	ASIC investigation, the examination of those persons by ASIC delegates and in respect of their
	defense costs of the ASIC proceedings. The Company has and may continue to incur costs under these
	indemnities which may be significant. In this respect, the Company has obligations, or has agreed,
	to advance funds in respect of defense costs and such advances have been and may continue to be
	made. Currently, a portion of the defense costs of former directors are being advanced by third
	parties, with the Company paying the balance. Based upon the information available to it
	presently, the Company expects this arrangement to continue. The Company notes that other
	recoveries may be available, including as a result of repayments by former directors and officers
	in accordance with the terms of their indemnities. It is the Company&#146;s policy to expense legal
	costs as incurred. The Company may also incur a liability to meet a proportion of ASIC&#146;s costs of
	the ASIC proceedings.
</DIV>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT; MARGIN-TOP: 6PT">
	There remains uncertainty surrounding the likely outcome of the ASIC proceedings and any potential
	appeals. There is a possibility that the Company could become responsible for other amounts in
	addition to defense costs, such as a proportion of ASIC&#146;s costs, as noted above. However, at this
	stage, the Company believes that although such amounts are reasonably possible, the amount or range
	of such amounts is not estimable.

	The Company denied and continues to deny the allegations of predatory pricing in Chile. The
	Company retained conduct of the appeal of the two civil damages matters. The Company intends to
	vigorously pursue all appellate and other alternatives as it does not concur with the decision of

	The operations of the Company, like those of other companies engaged in similar businesses, are
	subject to a number of federal, state and local laws and regulations on air and water quality,
	waste handling and disposal. The Company&#146;s policy is to accrue for environmental costs when it is
	determined that it is probable that an obligation exists and the amount can be reasonably
	estimated. In the opinion of management, based on information presently known except as set forth
	above, the ultimate liability for such matters is not expected to have a material adverse effect on
	either the Company&#146;s consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

	The Company is involved from time to time in various legal proceedings and administrative actions

	the outcome of any pending legal proceeding, management believes that such proceedings and actions
	should not, except as it relates to asbestos, ASIC proceedings, the Chile litigation and income
	taxes as described in these financial statements, individually or in the aggregate, have a material
	adverse effect on its consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

	Under SFAS No.&nbsp;109, &#147;Accounting for Income Taxes&#148;, the Company establishes a valuation allowance
	against a deferred tax asset if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred
	tax asset will not be realized. The Company has established a valuation allowance pertaining to all
	of its Australian capital loss carryforwards. The valuation allowance decreased by $22.3&nbsp;million
	during the fiscal year 2009 due to foreign currency movements and write-offs of certain losses as
	part of the ATO settlement.

	At March&nbsp;31, 2009, the undistributed earnings of non-Dutch subsidiaries approximated $724.9
	million. The Company intends to indefinitely reinvest these earnings, and accordingly, has not
	provided for taxes that would be
	payable upon remittance of those earnings. The amount of the potential deferred tax liability
	related to undistributed earnings is impracticable to determine at this time.
</DIV>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT; MARGIN-TOP: 6PT">
	The Company is subject to ongoing reviews by taxing jurisdictions on various tax matters, including
	challenges to various positions the Company asserts on its income tax returns. The Company accrues
	for tax contingencies based upon its best estimate of the taxes ultimately expected to be paid,
	which it updates over time as more information becomes available. Such amounts are included in
	taxes payable or other non-current liabilities, as appropriate. If the Company ultimately

	In fiscal years 2009, 2008 and 2007, the Company recorded income tax benefit of $3.0, nil and $10.4
	million, respectively, as a result of the finalization of certain tax audits (whereby certain
	matters were settled), the expiration of the statute of limitations related to certain tax
	positions and adjustments to income tax balances based on the filing of amended income tax returns,

	The Company currently derives significant tax benefits under the U.S.-Netherlands tax treaty. The

	2006. The amended treaty provides, among other things, requirements that the Company must meet for
	the Company to continue to qualify for treaty benefits and its effective income tax rate. During
	fiscal year 2006, the Company made changes to its organizational and operational structure to
	satisfy the requirements of the amended treaty and believes that it is in compliance and should
	continue qualifying for treaty benefits. However, if during a subsequent tax audit or related
	process, the Internal Revenue Service (&#147;IRS&#148;) determines that these changes do not meet the
	requirements, the Company may not qualify for treaty benefits and its effective income tax rate
	could significantly increase beginning in the fiscal year that such determination is made and it

	In March&nbsp;2006, RCI Pty Ltd (&#147;RCI&#148;), a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, received an amended

</DIV>
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT; MARGIN-TOP: 6PT">

	result, the Company has treated all payments in respect of the amended assessment that have been
	made up to March&nbsp;31, 2009 as a deposit and it is the Company&#146;s intention to treat any payments to
	be made at a later date as a deposit. As at March&nbsp;31, 2009 and 2008, this deposit totaled $173.5

	On June&nbsp;23, 2008, the IRS had issued the Company with a NOPA that concluded that the Company did

	is entitled to reduced withholding tax rates under the LOB for certain payments from the Company&#146;s
	United States subsidiaries to its Netherlands companies. There is no impact on the Company&#146;s
	fiscal year 2009 results. This agreement applies only to the 2006 and 2007 calendar years and does

	outlined in the LTIP rules. Unexercised options expire 10&nbsp;years from the date of issue. At March
	31, 2009, there were 2,148,000 options outstanding under this plan.

	Under the LTIP, the Company granted 1,569,622 and nil restricted shares of common stock to its
	employees in the years ended March&nbsp;31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. These restricted shares may
	not be sold, transferred, assigned, pledged or otherwise encumbered so long as such shares remain
	restricted. The Company determines the conditions or restrictions of any restricted stock awards,
	which may include requirements of continued employment, individual performance or the Company&#146;s
	financial performance or other criteria.

	At the 2006 Annual General Meeting, the Company&#146;s shareholders approved the replacement of its
	Supervisory Board Share Plan with a new plan called the Supervisory Board Share Plan 2006 (&#147;SBSP
	2006&#148;). Participation by members of the Supervisory Board in the SBSP 2006 is not mandatory. The
	SBSP 2006 allows the Company to issue new shares or acquire shares on the market on behalf of the
	participant. The total remuneration of a Supervisory Board member will take into account any
	participation in the SBSP 2006 and shares under the SBSP 2006. At March&nbsp;31, 2009, 79,342 shares had
	been acquired under this plan.

	The distribution channels for the Company&#146;s fiber cement products are concentrated. If the Company

	flows. The Company has three major customers that individually account for over 10% of the
