	&#147;active user account&#148; for a specific period means a registered user account that has accessed our services at least once during such relevant period; beginning in the third quarter of 2014, the operating
	metrics of &#147;active user accounts&#148; and &#147;monthly active user accounts,&#148; or MAUs, have been redefined to encompass active user accounts for many businesses not included in our user account metrics for prior periods. As such, the
	MAUs presented for periods since 2014 should not be compared to previously reported operating metrics in historical periods. The MAUs for 2014 and future periods are expected to be better aligned with the key underlying trends of our company as a
	mobile internet platform company focused on driving mobile consumer traffic and engagement that can be monetized. The MAU statistics do not include users we can indirectly reach through the installation of our advertising software development kit
	platforms into third-party applications, although such indirect users generate impressions and search traffic that we can monetize outside of the user accounts generated directly by our own portfolio of applications;

	&#147;premium user account&#148; means a user account that generates revenues either through direct payment or through indirect payment from third party developers and advertisers. We only present the premium user
	accounts metric for 2013, and will only present the redefined active user accounts metric from 2014 onward. Historically, as we diversified and expanded the monetization of our active user accounts in 2013, we replaced the paying user accounts
	metric we previously presented for 2011 and 2012, which refers to user accounts that have paid or subscribed for our premium services during the relevant period, with the premium user accounts metric. Therefore, the number of premium user accounts
	we presented for 2013 should not be compared with the number of paying user accounts we presented for 2011 and 2012;

	&#147;registered user account&#148; means a user account that was registered with us. We calculate registered user accounts for any particular period as the cumulative number of user accounts at the end of the relevant
	period. Because every time a person activates one of our mobile products after the initial installation, a unique registered user account is generated, and each person can install and activate more than one of our products on his or her smart
	device, each smart device could be associated with more than one of our registered user accounts. In addition, each person could have more than one smart device with our mobile products installed and activated. Consequently, the number of registered
	user accounts we present in this annual report for historical periods overstates the number of persons who were our registered users, and references to &#147;registered user accounts&#148; are only for periods prior to 2014. From 2014 onwards, we
	intend to only present &#147;active user account&#148; information (as defined above), including MAUs, for each quarter;

	To supplement the net income/ (loss) presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP, we use adjusted net income/ (loss) as

	The use of adjusted net income/ (loss) has material limitations as an analytical tool. A limitation of using non-GAAP cost of revenues,
	operating expenses, income from operations and net income, excluding share-based compensation expenses, is that these items have been and may continue to be significant expenses in our business for the foreseeable future. In addition, because
	adjusted net income/ (loss) is not calculated in the same manner by all companies, it may not be comparable to other similar titled measures used by other companies. In light of the foregoing limitations, you should not consider adjusted net income/
	(loss) as a substitute for or superior to net income/ (loss) prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. We encourage investors and others to review our financial information in its entirety and not rely on a single financial measure.

	We offer a diverse portfolio of consumer mobile security services to users globally through a &#147;Freemium&#148;
	business model. Our Freemium business model provides users with free services and the ability to upgrade to a selection of premium services either by paying subscription fees or engaging in an offer wall and advertising services. Our offer wall,
	launched in March 2013, provides a selection of self-developed and third-party sponsored applications, including mobile games. The offer wall allows users to accumulate points for downloading these applications and to use such points to upgrade to
	our premium services, as an alternative to paying subscription fees for the premium services. The success of our Freemium business model depends on, among other factors, our ability to convert our user accounts into premium user accounts

	and our ability to encourage user spending on additional products and services and user engagement in our advertising platform and mobile games. Although we constantly monitor and research user needs, we may be unable to meet user demands on
	a continuous basis or anticipate future user demands, which may adversely affect our ability to convert free user accounts into premium user accounts and materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations. Current premium users
	may also choose not to renew their subscriptions, click on our mobile advertisement or pay for mobile games through our offer wall. In addition, we may not be able to maintain and increase the prices of our premium products and services, which may
	have material and adverse effects on our growth and prospects.

	A portion of our

	begun to experience substantial growth in recent years both in terms of number of users and revenues. We cannot assure you, however, that the industry will continue to grow as rapidly as it has in the past. The growth of the mobile security, privacy
	and productivity industry is affected by numerous factors, such as users&#146; general communication experience, technological innovations, development of smart devices and other mobile devices, development of mobile Internet-based telecommunication
	services and applications, regulatory changes and the macroeconomic environment. If the mobile security, privacy and productivity industry in China or globally does not grow as quickly as expected or if we fail to benefit from such growth by
	successfully implementing our business strategies, our business and prospects may be materially and adversely affected.

	The mobile Internet industry is rapidly evolving and subject to continued technological developments. Our success depends on our ability to
	keep up with these technological developments and the resulting changes in user behavior. For example, an increasing number of mobile users have been able to access the Internet via an increasing number of different platforms, including Android,
	Symbian, iOS, BlackBerry OS and Windows Phone. Given that we operate in a rapidly evolving industry, we also need to continuously anticipate new security challenges and industry changes and respond to such changes in a timely and effective manner.
	There may be changes in the industry landscape as different types of platforms compete with one another for market share. For example, the Android platform has experienced faster growth than other competing platforms in recent years and has now
	become the more dominant platform among the smart device operating systems. If we do not adapt our products and services to such changes in an effective and timely manner as more platforms become available or certain platforms become dominant in the
	future, we may suffer loss in market share, and although we invest significant resources in research and development, we cannot predict the evolution of smart device operating systems or platforms in terms of releases, features, application
	programming interfaces, integrated security, privacy and productivity features. If access to existing smart device operating systems or platforms are changed in any way, thereby adversely affecting our ability to maintain, develop, sell, offer or

	Intensifying legal protection for the confidential information of users may subject us to greater

	operators in China and to enhance protection to Internet users in areas such as Internet security, web advertising and data protection. The provisions came into effect on March 15, 2012. These provisions echo the Chinese government&#146;s policy of
	intensifying protection of personal privacy. Internet information service providers are required to obtain users&#146; consent prior to collecting any users&#146; personal information or disclosing it to a third party. Non-compliance with these
	protection requirements may incur a fine of RMB10,000 to RMB30,000. On December 28, 2012, the Standing Committee of Congress of the PRC issued the Decision on Strengthening Internet Information Protection, reiterating that Internet service providers
	must explicitly specify the purpose, way, scope of collecting users&#146; individual information and obtain users&#146; consent prior to such collection. The Internet service provider is also prohibited from sending unsolicited commercial
	information to users. Non-compliance with these provisions may result in civil, administrative or criminal penalties. Pursuant to the Ninth Amendment to the Criminal Law issued by the Standing Committee of the National People&#146;s Congress in
	August 2015 and becoming effective in November 2015, any internet service provider that fails to fulfill the obligations related to internet information security administration as required by applicable laws and refuses to rectify upon orders, shall

	The Circular
	Regarding Strengthening the Administration of Foreign Investment in and Operation of Value Added Telecommunications Business, issued by the MIIT in July 2006, reiterated the regulations on foreign investment in telecommunications businesses, which
	require foreign investors to set up foreign-invested enterprises and obtain a business operating license to conduct any value-added telecommunications business in China. Under this circular, a domestic company that holds a telecommunications
	value-added services operation license is prohibited from leasing, transferring or selling the license to foreign investors in any form, and from providing any assistance, including providing resources, websites or facilities, to foreign investors
	that conduct any value added telecommunications business illegally in China. Furthermore, the relevant trademarks and domain names that are used in the value-added telecommunications business must be owned by the local license holder. This circular
	further requires each telecommunications value-added services operation license holder to have the necessary facilities for its approved business operations and to maintain such facilities in the regions covered by its license. In addition, all
	value-added telecommunications mobile payment service providers are required to maintain network and information security in accordance with the standards set forth under relevant PRC regulations. Due to a lack of interpretative materials from the
	regulator, it is unclear what impact this circular might have on us or the other Chinese telecommunications and Internet companies that have adopted the same or similar corporate and contractual structures as ours.

	The MIIT issued a circular in 2006 that emphasizes restrictions on foreign investment in
	value-added telecommunications businesses. In addition, a notice issued in 2009 by the General Administration of Press and Publication, or the GAPP, the National Copyright Administration, and the National Office of Combating Pornography and Illegal
	Publications states that foreign investors are not permitted to invest in online game operating businesses in China or to exercise control over or participate in the operation of such businesses through indirect means. The MIIT and the GAPP jointly
	issued Administrative Provisions on Online Publishing Services in 2016, which became effective on March 10, 2016, stated that foreign-invested enterprises are not permitted to engage in online publishing services, and the internet publishers must
	secure approval, or the Internet Publication license, from GAPP to conduct Internet publication activities, including operating of online games. Due to a lack of interpretative materials from the relevant PRC authorities, there are uncertainties
	regarding whether PRC authorities would consider our corporate structure and contractual arrangements to be a kind of foreign investment in value-added telecommunications services or online game operation businesses. Besides, the MIIT issued the
	Catalog of Telecom Service on February 28, 2015 based on the version of 2013 (&#147;2015 Catalog&#148;), according to 2015 Catalog, the readjustment maintains the fundamental classification structure of the previous version, namely,
	telecommunication services are divided into two main categories of basic telecommunication services and value-added telecommunication services. Regarding the Value-added telecommunication services, 2015 Catalog has combined and readjusted the
	subcategories under the previous Class 1 and Class 2 of value-added telecommunication services. The new Class 1 value-added telecommunication services is defined as services based on facilities and resources, while the new Class 2 value-added
	telecommunication services is defined as services based on public application platform. In the meantime, the 2015 Catalogue clarifies details of the content distribution internet services, the encoding and code conversion services, and subdivides
	the internet date center services, call center and information services. Specifically, the call center services (B24) has been divided into domestic call center services (B24-1) and offshore call center services (B24-2) for the purposes of further
	encouraging development of offshore call center services. To accommodate development of new technology and business in telecommunication industry, the 2015 Catalogue subdivides the information services into 5 subcategories: (i) the information
	dissemination platform and delivery services; (ii) the information searching services; (iii) the information community services; (iv) the information instant interaction services; and (v) the information protection and processing services, based on
	the specific forms of services and in accordance with the organization, delivery and other technical characteristics of information services.&nbsp;According to Regulations on the Main Functions, Internal Organization and Staffing of GAPP issued by
	the General Office of the State Council on July 11, 2008 and its interpretation circulars, GAPP is authorized to approve online games before their launch on the Internet, while the PRC Ministry of Culture, or the MOC is authorized to administer and
	regulate the overall online game industry. Once an online game is launched on the Internet, it will be regulated only by the MOC, and if an online game is launched on the Internet without the prior GAPP approval, the MOC is the authority responsible
	for investigating the matter. On September 7, 2009, the State Commission Office for Public Sector Reform, or the SCOPSR issued a circular for interpreting certain provisions of the Regulations on Three Provisions, in relation to comprehensive
	enforcement by GAPP, the MOC and the State Administration of Radio, Film and Television over animation, online game and cultural market. The interpretation states that: (1) the regulatory authority with overall administrative responsibility for the
	oversight of online games is the MOC, and GAPP&#146;s authority of administration over online games (other than pre-examination and approval before publication of online games on the Internet) has been granted to the MOC; (2) only the authority of
	pre-examination and approval for the publication of online games is retained by GAPP, but such authority is subject to the MOC&#146;s overall administration and is only limited to the stage prior to the games being brought online for operation; (3)
	once the games are online, they will be completely administrated and regulated by the MOC; and (4) the MOC is the sole regulator which has the authority to penalize online game operators who failed to obtain the pre-examination and approval from
	GAPP. On the other hand, GAPP does not have direct administrative jurisdiction over such activities. According to such circular issued by SCOPSR, we thus believe that the provision of the GAPP Notice discussed above with respect to regulation of
	online game operation does not apply to us or our PRC subsidiaries, nor does it affect our control over our PRC subsidiaries. While we are not aware of any online game companies which use the same or similar contractual arrangements as ours having
	been penalized or ordered to terminate operations by PRC authorities claiming that the arrangements constituted foreign investment in value-added telecommunication services or a kind of control over or participation in the operation of online game
	operating businesses through indirect means, it is unclear whether and how the various regulations of the PRC authorities might be interpreted or implemented in the future.

	Although we believe we are in compliance with current PRC regulations, we cannot assure you that the PRC government would agree that these
	contractual arrangements comply with PRC licensing, registration or other regulatory requirements, with existing policies or with requirements or policies that may be adopted in the future. PRC laws and regulations governing the validity of these
	contractual arrangements are uncertain and the relevant government authorities have broad discretion in interpreting these laws and regulations. If the PRC government determines that we do not comply with applicable laws and regulations, it could
	revoke our business and operating licenses, require us to discontinue or restrict our operations, restrict our right to collect revenues, block our websites, impose additional conditions or requirements with which we may not be able to comply, or
	take other regulatory or enforcement actions against us that could be harmful to our business. The imposition of any of these penalties would result in a material and adverse effect on our ability to conduct our business. The PRC government may also
	require us to restructure our operations entirely if it comes to find that our contractual arrangements do not comply with applicable laws and regulations. It is unclear how such mandatory restructuring could impact our business and operating
	results, as the PRC government has not yet found such contractual arrangements to be in non-compliance. However, any such restructuring may cause significant disruption to our business operations.

	embodies an expected PRC regulatory trend to rationalize its foreign investment regulatory regime in line with prevailing international practice and the legislative efforts to unify the corporate legal requirements for both foreign and domestic
	investments. The comment period of the Draft required by MOFCOM ended on February 17, 2015. The Draft, if enacted as proposed, may materially impact the viability of our current corporate structure, corporate governance and business operations in
	following aspects:
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:8%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Firstly, the Draft expands the definition of foreign investment and introduces the principle of &#147;actual
	control&#148; in determining whether a company is considered a foreign-invested enterprise, or an FIE. Under the Draft, the entities established in China but &#147;controlled&#148; by foreign investors will be treated as FIEs, whereas an entity set
	up in a foreign jurisdiction would nonetheless be, upon market entry clearance by the MOFCOM, treated as a PRC domestic investor provided that the entity is &#147;controlled&#148; by PRC entities and/or citizens. In this connection,
	&#147;control&#148; is broadly defined in the draft law to cover the following summarized categories: (i) holding, directly or indirectly, not less than 50% of shares, equities, share of properties, voting rights or other similar rights of the
	enterprise; (ii) holding, directly or indirectly, less than 50% of shares, equities, share of properties, voting rights or other similar rights of the enterprise, but falling under any of the following circumstances: (1) having the right to directly
	or indirectly appoint not less than half of the members of the board of directors or other similar decision-making body of the enterprise; (2) having the ability to ensure that its nominees occupy not less than half of seats in the board of
	directors or other similar decision-making body of the enterprise; or (3) holding voting rights sufficient to impose significant impacts on any resolution of the board of shareholders, at the general meeting of shareholders, or of the board of
	directors or other decision-making body of the enterprise; or (iii) having the power to exert decisive influence, via contractual or trust arrangements, over the subject entity&#146;s operations, financial matters or other key aspects of business
	operations. Once an entity is determined to be an FIE, it will be subject to the foreign investment restrictions or prohibitions set forth in a &#147;negative list,&#148; to be separately issued by the State Council later, if the FIE is engaged in
	the industry listed in the negative list. Unless the underlying business of the FIE falls within the negative list, which calls for market entry clearance by the MOFCOM, prior approval from the government authorities as mandated by the existing
	foreign investment legal regime would no longer be required for establishment of the VIE.

	The &#147;variable interest entity&#148; structure, or VIE structure, has been adopted by many

	enterprises are allowed to use its RMB capital converted from foreign exchange capitals to make equity investment, our PRC subsidiary is not established within the designated areas. On March 30, 2015, SAFE promulgated Circular 19, to expand the

	However, Circular 19 continues to prohibit foreign-invested enterprises from, among other things, using RMB fund converted from its foreign exchange capitals for expenditure beyond its business scope, providing entrusted loans or repaying loans
	between non-financial enterprises. In addition, SAFE strengthened its oversight of the flow and use of the RMB capital converted from foreign currency registered capital of a foreign-invested company. The use of such RMB capital may not be altered
	without SAFE&#146;s approval, and such RMB capital may not in any case be used to repay RMB loans if the proceeds of such loans have not been used.

	China has enacted regulations governing telecommunication mobile service providers,

	When Internet and mobile service providers find that any obscene, superstitious, fraudulent or defamatory information is transmitted on their
	platforms, they are required to terminate the transmission of such information or delete such information immediately, keep records, and report to relevant authorities. Mobile network operators like China Mobile, China Telecom and China Unicom also
	have their own policies prohibiting or restricting the distribution of inappropriate content. On December 15, 2009, the MIIT issued the Notice Regarding Plan for Further Regulating Obscene Materials on Mobile Phones, or Circular 672. Under Circular
	672, mobile network operators are required to examine their business, promotional channels, as well as the business of their partners, and must immediately terminate such business if any obscene material is involved. Mobile service providers
	involved in distributing or publishing such obscene materials on mobile handsets are subject to immediate suspension or termination of cooperation with mobile network operators, and a violation will be reported to relevant authorities. Mobile
	network operators and mobile service providers must examine all websites accessed through mobile handsets and conduct full daily inspection of such websites. If any obscene material is found, access and transmission must cease and be reported to
	authorities. On June 3, 2010, the MOC issued the Online Game Measures, which became effective on August 1, 2010, according to which companies that plan to engage in the operation of online games, issuance of virtual currency and provision of virtual
	currency transaction services shall obtain a license from the provincial counterpart of the MOC. Online and mobile game operators are required to establish a self-censorship mechanism and ensure the lawfulness of the content of their games and
	corporate operations. The Administrative Measures for Content Self-review by Internet Culture Business Entities, or the Content Self-review Administrative Measure, which took effect in December 2013, require Internet culture business entities to
	review the content of products and services to be provided prior to providing such content and services to the public. The content management system of an Internet culture business entity is required to specify the responsibilities, standards and
	processes for content review as well as accountability measures, and is required be filed with the local provincial branch of the MOC.

	The value of the RMB against the U.S. dollar and other currencies is affected by, among others, changes in China&#146;s political and economic
	conditions and China&#146;s foreign exchange policies. The conversion of RMB into foreign currencies, including U.S. dollars, is based on exchange rates set by the People&#146;s Bank of China. The PRC government allowed the RMB to appreciate by more
	than 20% against the U.S. dollar between July 2005 and July 2008. Between July 2008 and June 2010, this appreciation halted and the exchange rate between the RMB and the U.S. dollar remained within a narrow band. Since June&nbsp;2010, the RMB has

	The PRC government imposes controls on the convertibility of the

	HK, to fund any cash and financing requirements we may have. Under existing PRC foreign exchange regulations, payments of current account items, including profit distributions, interest payments and trade and service-related foreign exchange
	transactions, can be made in foreign currencies without prior SAFE approval by complying with certain procedural requirements. Therefore, NQ Beijing is able to pay dividends in foreign currencies to us without prior approval from SAFE. However,
	approval from or registration with appropriate government authorities is required where RMB is to be converted into foreign currency and remitted out of China to pay capital expenses such as the repayment of loans denominated in foreign currencies.
	The PRC government may also at its discretion restrict access to foreign currencies for current account transactions in the future. If the foreign exchange control system prevents us from obtaining sufficient foreign currencies to satisfy our

	Domestic Residents&#146; Offshore Investment and Financing and Roundtrip Investment through Special Purpose Vehicles, or SAFE Circular No. 37, on July 4, 2014, which replaced SAFE Circular No. 75. SAFE Circular No. 37 requires PRC residents to

	SPVs or PRC companies by such means as acquisition, trust, proxy, voting rights, repurchase, convertible bonds or other arrangements. SAFE Circular No. 37 further requires amendment to the registration in the event of any significant changes with
	respect to the SPV, such as increase or decrease of capital contributed by PRC individuals, share transfer or exchange, merger, division or other material event. In the event that a PRC shareholder holding interests in a SPV fails to fulfill the
	required SAFE registration, the PRC subsidiaries of that SPV may be prohibited from distributing profits to the offshore parent and from carrying out subsequent cross-border foreign exchange activities, and the SPV may be restricted in its ability
	to contribute additional capital into its PRC subsidiary. Moreover, failure to comply with the various SAFE registration requirements described above could result in liability under PRC law for evasion of foreign exchange controls.

	relevant term expires, its applicable enterprise income tax rate may increase to 25%, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, according to the Notice of the State Administration
	of Taxation on Further Clarifying the Standards for the Implementation of Preferential Policies Regarding Corporate Income Tax during the Transition Period issued on April 21, 2010, or Circular 157, where a resident enterprise is qualified as a high
	and new technology enterprise, and simultaneously is entitled to a term holiday under the phase-out rules of the EIT Law, the resident enterprise can choose either to enjoy the term holiday based on the phase-out tax rates (i.e., 18% for 2008, 20%
	for 2009, 22% for 2010, 24% for 2011 and 25% for 2012 and onwards) or enjoy the preferential tax rate of 15% as a high-tech enterprise. However, for taxable years 2008 through 2010, Beijing Technology applied a transitional tax rate of 7.5% as its
	applicable rate despite the provisions in Circular 157. This EIT rate has been approved by Beijing Haidian District State Tax Bureau as a transitional treatment to allow Beijing Technology to continue to enjoy its unexpired tax holiday under prior
	law. Since it is uncertain whether the State Administration of Taxation will enforce Circular 157 retrospectively, we cannot assure you that Beijing Technology will maintain the tax benefits it previously enjoyed, or that the local tax authorities
	will not, in the future, order the return of such tax benefits. NQ Beijing has already obtained the Software Enterprise Certification. Therefore, it qualifies for preferential tax treatment as a &#147;software enterprise&#148; under the EIT Law and
	is entitled to a two-year exemption from the first year it becomes profitable and a three-year 50% reduction in corporate income tax, upon its filing with its in-charge tax authority. In 2015, the applicable corporate income tax rate of NQ Beijing,
	NQ Tongzhou and FL Mobile was 12.5%, 0% for Century Hetu.

	Under the EIT Law, an enterprise established outside of China with its &#147;de facto management body&#148; within China is considered a
	resident enterprise and will be subject to enterprise income tax at the rate of 25% on its global income. The &#147;de facto management body&#148; is defined as the organizational body that effectively exercises overall management and control over
	production and business operations, personnel and human resources, finance and accounting, and properties of the enterprise. It remains unclear how the PRC tax authorities will interpret such a broad definition. On April 22, 2009, the SAT issued a
	circular, known as Circular 82, which provides certain specific criteria for determining whether the &#147;de facto management body&#148; of a PRC-controlled enterprise that is incorporated offshore is located in China. Under Circular 82, an
	offshore incorporated enterprise controlled by a PRC enterprise or a PRC enterprise group will be regarded as a PRC tax resident by virtue of having its &#147;de facto management body&#148; in China and will be subject to PRC enterprise income tax
	on its global income only if all of the following conditions are met: (i) the primary location of the day-to-day operational management is in the PRC; (ii) decisions relating to the enterprise&#146;s financial and human resource matters are made or
	are subject to approval by organizations or personnel in the PRC; (iii) the enterprise&#146;s primary assets, accounting books and records, company seals, and board and shareholder resolutions, are located or maintained in the PRC; and (iv) at least
	50% of voting board members or senior executives habitually reside in the PRC. Further to Circular 82, the SAT issued a bulletin, known as SAT Bulletin 45, which became effective in September 2011, to provide more guidance on the implementation of
	Circular 82 and clarify the reporting and filing obligations of such &#147;Chinese-controlled offshore incorporated resident enterprises.&#148; SAT Bulletin 45 provides procedures and administrative details for the determination of resident status
	and administration on post-determination matters. Although both Circular 82 and SAT Bulletin 45 only apply to offshore enterprises controlled by PRC enterprises or PRC enterprise groups, not those controlled by PRC individuals or foreigners, the
	criteria set forth in the Circular 82 and SAT Bulletin 45 may reflect the SAT&#146;s general position on how the &#147;de facto management body&#148; test should be applied in determining the tax resident status of all offshore enterprises,
	regardless of whether they are controlled by PRC enterprises, PRC enterprise groups or by PRC or foreign individuals.

	China enacted the Labor Contract Law effective on January 1, 2008. The Labor Contract Law
	introduces specific provisions related to fixed-term employment contracts, part-time employment, probation, consultation with labor union and employee assemblies, employment without a written contract, dismissal of employees, severance, and
	collective bargaining, which together represent enhanced enforcement of labor laws and regulations. According to the Labor Contract Law, an employer is obliged to sign an unlimited-term labor contract with any employee who has worked for the
	employer for ten consecutive years. Further, if an employee requests or agrees to renew a fixed-term labor contract that has already been entered into twice consecutively, the resulting contract must have an unlimited term, with certain exceptions.
	The employer must also pay severance to an employee in nearly all instances where a labor contract, including a contract with an unlimited term, is terminated or expires. In addition, the government has continued to introduce various new
	labor-related regulations after the Labor Contract Law. Among other things, new annual leave requirements mandate that annual leave ranging from five to 15 days is available to nearly all employees and further require that the employer compensate an
	employee for any annual leave day the employee is unable to take in the amount of three times the employee&#146;s daily salary, subject to certain exceptions. We cannot assure you that our employment practices do not or will not violate the Labor
	Contract Law and other labor-related regulations. If we are subject to severe penalties or incur significant liabilities in connection with labor disputes or investigations, our business and results of operations may be adversely affected.

	In addition, the stock market

	Our
	common shares are divided into Class A common shares and Class B common shares. Holders of Class A common shares are entitled to one vote per share, while holders of Class B common shares are entitled to ten votes per share. We issued Class A common
	shares represented by our ADSs in our initial public offering. All of our outstanding common shares prior to the initial public offering were redesignated as Class B common shares and our outstanding preferred shares were automatically converted
	into Class B common shares upon the completion of our initial public offering. In addition, all options issued prior to the completion of our initial public offering entitle option holders to the equivalent number of Class B common shares once the
	options are vested and exercised. Due to the disparate voting powers attached to these two classes, certain shareholders have significant voting power of our outstanding common shares and have considerable influence over matters requiring

	quarterly value of our assets (as determined on the basis of fair market value) during such year produce or are held for the production of passive income (the &#147;asset test&#148;). Although the law in this regard is unclear, we treat our PRC

	Assuming that we are the owner of our PRC consolidated affiliated entity for United States federal income tax purposes, although not free from

	changes in the nature of our income and assets, our significant cash balances and because the value of our assets for purposes of the PFIC test will generally be determined by reference to the market price of our ADSs. Accordingly, fluctuations in
	the market price of our ADSs may cause us to become a PFIC for the current or future taxable years. The determination of whether we will be or become a PFIC will also be affected by how, and how quickly, we use our liquid assets. Under circumstances
	where we determine not to deploy significant amounts of cash for active purposes or our consolidated affiliated entity was not treated as owned by us for United States federal income tax purposes, our risk of being classified as a PFIC may
	substantially increase. Because there are uncertainties in the application of the relevant rules and PFIC status is a factual determination made annually after the close of each taxable year, there can be no assurance that we will not be a PFIC for
	the current taxable year or any future taxable year.

	on the receipt of distributions on the ADSs or common shares and such holders may be subject to burdensome reporting requirements. Further, if we are classified as a PFIC for any year during which a U.S. Holder holds our ADSs or common shares, we
	generally will continue to be treated as a PFIC for all succeeding years during which such U.S. Holder holds our ADSs or common shares. For more information see &#147;Item 10. Additional Information &#151;E. Taxation&#151;United States Federal

	USPTO. Some of the intellectual properties our company currently uses are held by individuals, all of whom have entered into assignment or exclusive patent licensing agreements with us. We have also made 402 copyright registrations and 154 trademark

	The MOFCOM published a discussion draft of the proposed Foreign Investment Law (the
	&#147;Draft&#148;) in January 2015 aiming to, upon its enactment, replace the trio of existing laws regulating foreign investment in China. The Draft embodies an expected PRC regulatory trend to rationalize its foreign investment regulatory regime
	in line with prevailing international practice and the legislative efforts to unify the corporate legal requirements for both foreign and domestic investments. The MOFCOM is currently soliciting comments on the Draft and substantial uncertainties
	exist with respect to its enactment timetable, interpretation and implementation. The Draft, if enacted as proposed, may materially impact the viability of our current corporate structure, corporate governance and business operations. The Draft
	expands the definition of foreign investment and introduces the principle of &#147;actual control&#148; in determining whether a company is considered an FIE. Under the Draft, the entities established in China but &#147;controlled&#148; by foreign
	investors will be treated as FIEs, whereas an entity set up in a foreign jurisdiction would nonetheless be, upon market entry clearance by the MOFCOM, treated as a PRC domestic investor provided that the entity is &#147;controlled&#148; by PRC
	entities and/or citizens. In this connection, &#147;control&#148; is broadly defined in the draft law to cover the following summarized categories: (i)&nbsp;holding, directly or indirectly, not less than 50% of shares, equities, share of properties,
	voting rights or other similar rights of the enterprise; (ii)&nbsp;holding, directly or indirectly, less than 50% of shares, equities, share of properties, voting rights or other similar rights of the enterprise, but falling under any of the
	following circumstances: (1)&nbsp;having the right to directly or indirectly appoint not less than half of the members of the board of directors or other similar decision-making body of the enterprise; (2)&nbsp;having the ability to ensure that its
	nominees occupy not less than half of seats in the board of directors or other similar decision-making body of the enterprise; or (3)&nbsp;holding voting rights sufficient to impose significant impacts on any resolution of the board of shareholders,
	at the general meeting of shareholders, or of the board of directors or other decision-making body of the enterprise; or (iii)&nbsp;having the power to exert decisive influence, via contractual or trust arrangements, over the subject entity&#146;s
	operations, financial matters or other key aspects of business operations. Once an entity is determined to be an FIE, it will be subject to the foreign investment restrictions or prohibitions set forth in a &#147;negative list,&#148; to be
	separately issued by the State Council later, if the FIE is engaged in the industry listed in the negative list.&nbsp;Unless the underlying business of the FIE falls within the negative list, which calls for market entry clearance by the MOFCOM,
	prior approval from the government authorities as mandated by the existing foreign investment legal regime would no longer be required for establishment of the FIE.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:8%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Under the Draft, variable interest entities that are controlled via contractual arrangement would also be deemed as FIEs, if they are
	ultimately &#147;controlled&#148; by foreign investors. Therefore, for any companies with a VIE structure in an industry category that is on the &#147;negative list,&#148; the VIE structure may be deemed legitimate only if the ultimate controlling
	person(s) is/are of PRC nationality (either PRC companies or PRC citizens). Conversely, if the actual controlling person(s) is/are of foreign nationalities, then the variable interest entities will be treated as FIEs and any operation in the
	industry category on the &#147;negative list&#148; without market entry clearance may be considered as illegal. Moreover, for the enterprises which are not incorporated under the laws of China (foreign investors) but are &#147;controlled&#148; by
	Chinese investors, they may submit documentary evidence to apply for identifying their investment as the investment by Chinese investors when they applying for the market entry clearance to engage in any investment as set out in the &#147;negative
	list&#148; in China. The competent authorities of foreign investment will grant the review opinion on whether the said investment is identified as the investment by Chinese investors.

	To further regulate the provision of audio-visual program services to the public via the internet, including through mobile networks, within

	January&nbsp;31, 2008. Providers of internet audio-visual program services are required to obtain a License for Online Transmission of Audio-Visual Programs issued by SARFT, or complete certain registration procedures with SARFT. In general,
	providers of internet audio-visual program services must be either state-owned or state-controlled entities, and the business to be carried out by such providers must satisfy the overall planning and guidance catalog for internet audio-visual
	program service determined by SARFT. In a press conference jointly held by SARFT and MIIT to answer questions relating to the Audio-Visual Program Provisions in February 2008, SARFT and MIIT clarified that providers of internet audio-visual program
	services who engaged in such services prior to the promulgation of the Audio-Visual Program Provisions are eligible to register their business and continue their operation of internet audio-visual program services so long as those providers did not
	violate the relevant laws and regulations in the past. On May&nbsp;21, 2008, SARFT issued a Notice on Relevant Issues Concerning Application and Approval of License for the Online Transmission of Audio-Visual Programs, which further sets out
	detailed provisions concerning the application and approval process regarding the License for Online Transmission of Audio-Visual Programs. The notice also states that providers of internet audio-visual program services that engaged in such services
	prior to the promulgation of the Audio-Visual Program Provisions are eligible to apply for the license so long as their violation of the laws and regulations is minor in scope and can be rectified in a timely manner and they have no records of
	violation during the last three months prior to the promulgation of the Audio-Visual Program Provisions. Further, on March&nbsp;31, 2009, SARFT promulgated the Notice on Strengthening the Administration of the Content of Internet Audio-Visual
	Programs, which reiterates the pre-approval requirements for the audio-visual programs transmitted via the internet, including through mobile networks, where applicable, and prohibits certain types of internet audio-visual programs containing
	violence, pornography, gambling, terrorism, superstition or other similarly prohibited elements.

	data protected have become significant concerns for businesses and employees. Enterprise mobility is a relatively new and fast-growing industry in China and around the world and we believe factors such as IT consumerization, BYOD adoption and
	availability of smart mobile devices at affordable prices are the key drivers for the growth of enterprise mobility across different industry sectors.

	We
	recognize revenues net of value added tax business tax and related surcharges. We derive our net revenues primarily from (i) mobile value added services, which include mobile game publishing, mobile entertainment applications and platforms, and
	mobile security, productivity and other applications, (ii) mobile advertising and (iii) mobile enterprise mobility. We generate mobile game publishing revenues from operating free-to-play mobile games that monetize through sales of in-game virtual
	items. We generate mobile entertainment applications and platform revenues primarily from our live mobile social video platform where mobile users can interact with hosts and monetize through the sale of in-app virtual items and games.&nbsp;For our
	consumer mobile security services, we focus on mobile security, privacy protection and productivity services and provide for free the basic functions of such services, such as the anti-malware scanning, anti-spam, contact back-up and restore
	functions. We charge our users a subscription fee for subscribing to our premium services, such as access to continual updates of our virus library and advanced privacy protection services, on a monthly, quarterly, semi-annual or annual basis. We
	generate advertising revenues on CPA and CPT basis through our mobile security applications, mobile games, advertising network platform and offline channels. For our enterprise users, we derive enterprise mobility product revenues from sales of
	mobile hardware and enterprise mobility service revenues from the offering of managed mobility services. In addition, we derive a portion of our net revenues from other sources, such as secured download and technology development services to third
	parties. In December 2015 we completed the divestment of NationSky and will have less revenues from this segment going forward compared to recent periods.

	Due to the expansion of our business and diversification of our revenue streams, we re-classified our revenues into the following categories
	beginning in 2013: mobile value added services (including mobile game publishing, mobile entertainment applications and platforms, and consumer mobile security, productivity and applications.), enterprise mobility, advertising services and other
	services. As a result, we re-classified in the consolidated results of operations table, and the presentation of the revenue categories for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2014 and 2015 in this annual report are in conformity with these new
	revenue categories.

	Mobile game publishing revenues are derived from third-party developed mobile games and self-developed mobile games.
	We enter into exclusive or joint operation agreements with game developers for licensed mobile game applications. Game players can download the free-to-play games and pay to acquire virtual currency which can be redeemed in the games for in-game
	virtual items. Pursuant to agreements signed between us and game developers, revenues from the sales of virtual currency to be used for the purchase of virtual items are shared between us and the game developers based on a pre-agreed ratio for each
	game. We also generate mobile games revenues from offering virtual items in self-developed mobile games and collect license fees of our self-developed mobile games. Within the storefronts, game players can download our free-to-play games and pay to
	acquire virtual currency which can be redeemed in the games for in-game virtual items.

	Mobile Entertainment Applications and Platforms
	consists primarily from our live mobile social video platform - Showself, revenues are mainly derived from the sale of virtual currency which can be used to purchase virtual presents and items in the Rooms. All the Rooms can be accessed for free.
	Our operating entities primarily cooperate with independent third-party distributors to sell our virtual currency through the annual distribution agreements with these distributors. Pursuant to the distribution agreements with these distributors,
	each distributor is responsible for sales of virtual currency for one or more of our communities through developing and engaging sales agents who directly sell the virtual currency to users. We have discretion to determine the price of the virtual
	currency sold to sales agents or users. In addition, we take overall responsibility of the content or performances provided by hosts in our community. Consequently, we recognize revenue on a gross basis pursuant to ASC 605-45.

	We collect net revenues from consumer mobile security services primarily through three payment channels. First, we cooperate with wireless
	carriers, either directly or through mobile payment service providers, to provide services to users. In this payment channel, wireless carriers charge a fixed percentage of the total user payment as a fee primarily for billing, collection and
	customer support services relating to the end users. We recognize net revenues excluding the fees retained by wireless carriers. If we cooperate with wireless carriers through mobile payment service providers, we pay a fee to the mobile payment
	service providers and the amounts attributed to mobile payment service providers are recognized as cost of revenues. Second, we sell prepaid cards to customers of our consumer mobile security services through independent distributors and amortize
	such net proceeds from the distributors as net revenues on a straight-line basis over the subscription period. Third, users can subscribe for our consumer mobile security services directly through our website and make payments through third-party
	payment processors. We recognize the proceeds collected through third-party payment processors as revenues on a gross basis and the amounts attributed to third-party payment processors are recognized as cost of revenues.

	Advertising revenues are derived from the advertisement placement services on our platform. Advertising fees are generally charged to
	advertisers on a cost per action (&#147;CPA&#148;) basis. The desired actions to be performed include but are not limited to activation, download, click, registration or opt-ins, which are determined by the advertisers. The revenues are generally
	recognized when the end users activate the applications, register accounts or deliver their opt-ins. We also provide advertisement placements on our websites and interest-based communities. We enter into pay-for-time (&#147;CPT&#148;) contracts with
	advertisers, under which the fixed price and advertising services are established upfront and charged ratably over the contractual period of display.

	Enterprise mobility revenues are derived primarily from hardware sales to enterprise customers
	for their provision of mobility solutions, technology and software development, and commission income shared with mobile network operators. We recognize the hardware procurement revenue once customers acknowledge the receipt of the hardware
	delivered and title and risk of loss have been transferred. Mobility solution revenue in connection with agreements for standard proprietary software is recognized upon delivery of the software, provided that collection is considered probable and
	the fee is fixed or determinable. Revenues from technology and software development are recognized when services are completed. Commission income is derived from bringing enterprise customers to the mobile network operators and is determined based
	on fixed percentages, agreed with the mobile operators, of actual charges to the enterprise customers. We recognize the commission incomes in the month in which the service is provided to the enterprise customers.

	Due to the expansion of our business and diversification of our revenue streams, we re-classified our revenues into the following categories in 2013: mobile value added services (including consumer mobile security,
	mobile games, and live mobile social video platform), enterprise mobility, advertising services and other services. As a result, we re-classified in the above table, within this annual report, the presentation of the revenue categories for the years
	ended December 31, 2013, 2014 and 2015 in conformity with these new revenue categories.

	Net revenues from mobile value
	added services, which included mobile game publishing, mobile entertainment applications and platforms and consumer mobile security and productivity applications increased from 2013 to 2015. The increase in mobile value added service revenues was
	primarily due to the increase in mobile game revenues and the inclusion of live mobile social video platform revenues, partially offset by the decrease in consumer mobile security revenues. The increase in mobile game revenues was primarily the
	result of the continuing expansion of FL Mobile&#146;s business in both domestic and overseas markets. The inclusion of live mobile social video platform revenues is the result of the consolidation of Showself. The decrease in consumer mobile
	security revenues was primarily due to moving our focus away from premium security subscription-based revenues and focusing more on other consumer mobile applications and services.

	Net revenues from advertising services increased from 2013 to 2015, due primarily to (i) the

	We acquire users primarily through viral marketing, or word-of-mouth marketing, pre-installation and online
	download. We provide online downloads of our products and services via various third-party websites, including online advertising networks, Internet portals and mobile application stores. We pay such third parties a fee for each registered user
	account acquired through them. Payments to these third parties increased from 2013 to 2015 as we acquired more users through them during these periods. We also pay fees to handset manufacturers to pre-install our applications on their handsets. As
	we further expand our global user base and grow our revenue, we expect payments to third parties in connection with user acquisition to continue to increase.

	Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which
	have been prepared in accordance with US GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related
	disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We continually evaluate these estimates and assumptions based on the most recently available information, our own historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable
	under the circumstances. Since the use of estimates is an integral component of the financial reporting process, actual results could differ from those estimates.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:8%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	An accounting policy is considered critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are
	highly uncertain at the time such estimate is made, and if different accounting estimates that reasonably could have been used, or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely to occur periodically, could materially impact the
	consolidated financial statements. We believe that our accounting policies with respect to revenue recognition, segment reporting, goodwill, impairment of long-lived assets, allowance for doubtful accounts, share-based compensation, income taxes,
	equity investments, convertible debts, and mezzanine equity represent critical accounting policies that reflect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:8%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The following descriptions of critical accounting policies, judgments and estimates should be read in conjunction with our consolidated
	financial statements and other disclosures included elsewhere in this annual report. When reviewing our financial statements, you should consider (i) our selection of critical accounting policies, (ii) judgments and other uncertainties affecting the
	application of such policies and (iii) the sensitivity of reported results to changes in conditions and assumptions.

	revenue pursuant to ASC 605, Revenue Recognition. Provided collectability is probable, revenue is recognized over the usage period which is the same for software-related services and services where software is incidental to the provision of the
	services. Basic functions and customer support are provided to end users free of charge, whether they subscribe to our services or not. Customer arrangements may include premium mobile security and productivity services which are multiple elements.
	Revenue on arrangements that include multiple elements is allocated to each element based on the relative fair value of each element. Fair value is generally determined by vendor-specific-objective-evidence, or VSOE. For all the periods presented,
	the usage period for the elements in arrangements that include multiple elements is the same. No allocation was performed as there is no impact from the allocation on revenue recognized.

	We estimate the playing periods of paying users based on available data obtained since September

	playing the game. We then calculate the average of the time periods from the first purchase date to the date the last player is expected to cease playing the game for each game player to determine the total average playing period for that game.

	games to determine when the paying players stop playing the games. For the players who have not logged onto a game for 50 days as of the period end, we deem them inactive players. For the players who have not logged onto a game for less than 50 days

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:8%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The determination of whether to record these revenues using gross or net method is based on an assessment of various factors. The primary

	For third-party developed games under exclusive operation agreements and self-developed games, we recognize revenue based on the gross amount

	To

	of in-game virtual items and does not take overall responsibility of the services provided to the customers, 2) does not have pricing latitude and only receives a fixed commission, 3) does not have inventory risk, 4) does not change the virtual
	items sold or determine specifications of the game or the virtual items sold, and 5) does not have credit risk. In the case of self-developed games and third-party developed games under exclusive operation by us, Platforms are our agents. In the
	case of third-party developed games under joint operation, Platforms are the agents of the game developers.

	The initial license fee is generally a fixed amount and recognized ratably over the term of the license. The non-refundable minimum guarantee is generally a fixed amount and recognized once the fees are collected. The revenue-based fees under
	revenue-sharing arrangement are generally equal to a fixed percentage of the revenues generated by the game operators from the sale of virtual items and are recognized when the game operators provide us with the monthly billing confirmation.

	actual charges to the enterprise users as agreed with the mobile operators. Commission incomes are recognized in the month in which the service is provided to the enterprise users. For the amount of revenues to be recognized, we firstly estimate the

	We test
	goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level on an annual basis as of November 1, and between annual tests when an event occurs or circumstances change that indicate that the assets might be impaired. Commencing in September 2011, in
	accordance with the FASB revised guidance on &#147;Testing of Goodwill for Impairment,&#148; a company first has the option to assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less
	than its carrying amount. If we decide, as a result of the qualitative assessment, that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, the quantitative impairment test is mandatory. Otherwise, no
	further testing is required. The quantitative impairment test consists of a two-step goodwill impairment test. The first step compares the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying amount. If the fair value of each reporting unit exceeds its
	carrying amount, goodwill is not considered to be impaired and the second step will not be required. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the second step compares the implied fair value of goodwill to the carrying value
	of a reporting unit&#146;s goodwill. The implied fair value of goodwill is determined in a manner similar to accounting for a business combination with the allocation of the assessed fair value determined in the first step to the assets and
	liabilities of the reporting unit. The excess of the fair value of the reporting unit over the amounts assigned to the assets and liabilities is the implied fair value of goodwill. This allocation process is only performed for purposes of evaluating
	goodwill impairment and does not result in an entry to adjust the value of any assets or liabilities. An impairment loss is recognized for any excess in the carrying value of goodwill over the implied fair value of goodwill.

	Our total cost of revenues increased by 40.9% from US$226.7

	much lower gross margin than other portions of our business. The other primary reason for the decline in gross profit and gross margin is the free charge of mobile security services in domestic markets and higher customer acquisition costs and

</I>
</B>
	Our total cost of revenues increased by 180.1% from US$80.9 million in 2013 to US$226.7 million in
	2014. This increase was primarily due to: (i) an increase in hardware procurement costs from US$37.4 million in 2013 to US$128.5 million in 2014 following our acquisitions of NationSky in May 2012 and Trustek in January 2014; (ii) an increase in
	user acquisition cost from US$19.7 million in 2013 to US$26.8 million in 2014, primarily as payments to handset manufacturers and distributors for pre-installation and to third-party websites increased as we acquired more registered user accounts
	and active user accounts through these channels; (iii) amortization of intangible assets resulted from the acquisition activities; and (iv) an increase in staff cost from US$5.3&nbsp;million in 2013 to US$11.7 million in 2014, mainly in the form of
	increased salary and headcount as our overall business continues to expand. Our cost of services increased by 125.5% from US$43.6 million in 2013 to US$98.2 million in 2014. Our cost of products sold increased by 243.6% from US$37.4 million in 2013
	to US$128.5 million in 2014. Our cost of products sold is primarily due to hardware procurement cost for NationSky and Trustek&#146;s enterprise mobility business.

	As a result of the foregoing, our gross profit decreased by 8.7% from US$115.8 million in 2013 to
	US$105.7 million in 2014. Our gross margin decreased from 58.9% in 2013 to 31.8% in 2014. This decrease was primarily due to the impact from the enterprise mobility business, which has much lower gross margin than other portions of our business.
	Excluding the impact from the enterprise mobility business, our gross profit in 2014 was US$91.5 million, representing a 10.6% decreased from US$102.3 million in 2013. The gross margin of the enterprise mobility business in 2014 was 9.5%. Our gross

	business expansion; and (ii) an increase in staff costs, including salaries, benefits and commissions to our sales and marketing personnel, from US$6.9 million in 2013 to US$11.5 million in 2014, as a result of the increased employee headcount
	resulting from our acquisition activities. The selling and marketing expenses related to our enterprise business were US$4.7 million in 2014, increased from US$2.7 million in 2013. The increase was mainly due to the increase in staff costs,

	. Our general and administrative expenses increased by 70.1% from

	2014, primarily attributable to the grant of restricted shares in connection with our acquisition activities and to our senior executives and employees in 2014; (ii) an increase in staff cost from US$8.2 million in 2013 to US$14.7 million in 2014,
	resulting mostly from salary increases and the hiring of additional senior executives; and (iii) an increase in legal and professional fees from US$7.2 million in 2013 to US$14.0 million in 2014, largely in connection with our acquisition activities
	and our reactions to the short seller allegations. The general and administrative expenses related to our enterprise business were US$4.5 million in 2014, increased from US$2.0 million in 2013. The increase was mainly due to the increase in staff

	In May 2014, the FASB issued Topic 606, &#147;Revenue from Contracts with Customers&#148;. This topic clarifies the principles for recognizing
	revenue and develops a common revenue standard for U.S. GAAP and IFRS. Simultaneously, this topic supersedes the revenue recognition requirements in Topic 605, Revenue Recognition, and most industry-specific guidance throughout the Industry Topics
	of the Codification. The core principle of the guidance requires an entity to recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled
	in exchange for those goods or services. To achieve that core principle, an entity should apply the five steps: 1) identify the contract(s) with a customer; 2) identify the performance obligations in the contract; 3) determine the transaction price;
	4) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; 5) recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation. The amendments are effective for annual reporting periods beginning after
	December&nbsp;15, 2016, including interim periods within that reporting period. Early application is not permitted. This amendments shall be applied retrospectively either to each prior reporting periods or with the cumulative effect of initially
	applying this amendments recognized at the date of initial application. In August of 2015, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (&#147;ASU&#148;) 2015-14, Revenue from Contracts with Customer (Topic 606): Deferral of the Effective Date. This
	ASU was fairly straight forward and simple as it defers the effective date of ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, for all entities. With the issuance of ASU 2015-14, public business entities should apply the guidance in ASU 2014-09
	to annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim reporting periods within that reporting period. Earlier application is permitted only as of annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including
	interim reporting periods within that reporting period. The Group is in process of evaluating the cumulative effect on the consolidated financial statements of adopting this guidance so as to transit to the new revenue recognition guidance in 2018.

	In June 2014, the FASB issued guidance on &#147;Stock Compensation &#150; Accounting for Share-Based Payments When the Terms of an Award
	Provide That a Performance Target Could Be Achieved after the Requisite Service Period&#148;. The amendments clarify that a performance target that affects vesting and that could be achieved after the requisite service period should be treated as a
	performance condition. As such, the performance target should not be reflected in estimating the grant-date fair value of the award. No matter when the performance target becomes probable of being achieved, the compensation cost should be recognized
	in the period in which it becomes probable that the performance target will be achieved and should represent the compensation cost attributable to the period(s) for which the requisite service has already been rendered. The amendments are effective
	for annual periods and interim periods within those annual periods beginning after December&nbsp;15, 2015. Earlier adoption is permitted. The Group had evaluated that there is no impact on the consolidated financial statements of adopting this
	guidance.

	In April 2015, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2015-03, Interest &#150; Imputation of Interest (Subtopic
	835-30): Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs. It requires companies to present debt issuance costs the same way they currently present debt discounts, as a direct deduction from the carrying value of that debt liability. ASU 2015-03
	does not impact the recognition and measurement guidance for debt issuance costs. For public businesses, ASU No. 2015-03 will be effective for fiscal years starting after December 15, 2015, including any interim periods within those years. Early
	adoption of ASU No. 2015-03 will be allowed for financial statements that have yet to be issued. The amendments of ASU No. 2015-03 must be applied retrospectively, where the balance sheet of each presented individual period is adjusted to indicate
	the period-specific impact of using the new guidance. During the transition phase, a business must adhere to the appropriate disclosures for an adjustment in an accounting principle. Such disclosures include why the change in accounting principle is
	occurring, the method of transition, a explanation of the previous period&#146;s information that was retrospectively adjusted, and how the change impacts the financial statement line items (i.e., debt issuance cost asset and the debt liability).The
	Group had evaluated that there is no impact on the consolidated financial statements of adopting this guidance.

	In July 2015, the FASB

	realizable value.&nbsp;Net realizable value is defined by the FASB as estimated selling prices in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal and transportation.&nbsp;This ASU does not change the
	measurement principles for inventories valued under the LIFO method.&nbsp;The amendments in this Update are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The Group is in process of
	evaluating the cumulative effect on the consolidated financial statements of adopting this guidance so as to transit to the new guidance in the year of 2017.

	In September 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-16, Simplifying the Accounting for
	Measurement-Period Adjustments, which eliminates the requirement for acquirers in a business combination to account for measurement-period adjustments retrospectively. Instead, acquirers must recognize measurement-period adjustments during the
	period in which they determine the amounts, including the effect on earnings of any amounts that would have been recorded in previous periods if the accounting had been completed at the acquisition date. This update is effective for interim and
	annual periods beginning after December 15, 2015, with early adoption permitted. The implementation of this update is not expected to have any material impact on the Group&#146;s consolidated financial statements.

	In November 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-17, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes. The update eliminates
	the requirement to classify deferred tax assets and liabilities as noncurrent or current within a classified statement of financial position. Current guidance requires entities to classify deferred taxes as noncurrent or current. Under ASU 2015-17,
	a reporting entity is required to classify deferred tax assets and liabilities as noncurrent in a classified statement of financial position. Current guidance requiring the offsetting of deferred tax assets and liabilities of a tax-paying component
	of an entity and presentation as a single noncurrent amount is not affected. The amendment applies to all entities that present a classified statement of financial position. The update is effective for public business entities issuing financial
	statements for the annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those annual periods. Early application is permitted for financial statements as of the beginning of an interim or annual reporting period. Entities may
	apply the update prospectively to all deferred tax assets and liabilities and taxes, or retrospectively for all periods presented. If an entity applies the update prospectively, the entity shall disclose the nature and reason of the change in
	accounting principle and disclose that the prior periods were not retrospectively adjusted. If an entity adopts the update retrospectively, the entity shall disclose the nature and reason of the change in accounting principle and disclose the
	quantitative effects of the accounting change on prior periods. The Group had evaluated that there is no impact on the consolidated financial statements of adopting this guidance.

	The FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842). ASU 2016-01 requires that a lessee recognize the assets and liabilities that arise from
	operating leases. A lessee should recognize in the statement of financial position a liability to make lease payments (the lease liability) and a right-of-use asset representing its right to use the underlying asset for the lease term. For leases
	with a term of 12 months or less, a lessee is permitted to make an accounting policy election by class of underlying asset not to recognize lease assets and lease liabilities. In transition, lessees and lessors are required to recognize and measure
	leases at the beginning of the earliest period presented using a modified retrospective approach. Public business entities should apply the amendments in ASU 2016-02 for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods
	within those fiscal years (i.e., January 1, 2019, for a calendar year entity). Early application is permitted for all public business entities and all nonpublic business entities upon issuance. The Group is in process of evaluating the cumulative
	effect on the consolidated financial statements of adopting this guidance so as to transit to the new revenue recognition guidance in 2019.

	Current PRC regulations permit our subsidiary to pay dividends to us only out of its accumulated profits, if
	any, determined in accordance with Chinese accounting standards and regulations. Under PRC law, each of our wholly owned PRC subsidiaries and consolidated affiliated entities is required to set aside at least 10% of its after-tax profits each year,
	if any, to fund a statutory reserve until such reserve reaches 50% of each of their respective registered capital. Although the statutory reserves can be used, among other ways, to increase the registered capital and offset future losses in excess
	of retained earnings of the respective companies, the reserve funds are not distributable as cash dividends except in the event of liquidation. As a result of these PRC laws and regulations, our PRC subsidiaries and consolidated affiliated entities
	are restricted in their abilities to transfer net assets to us in the form of dividends, loans or advances. Total restricted net assets of our PRC subsidiaries and consolidated affiliated entities were US$79.0 million, US$93.5 million and US$89.6
	million as of December 31, 2013, 2014 and 2015, respectively. Furthermore, cash transfers from our PRC subsidiaries to our subsidiaries outside of China are subject to PRC government control of currency conversion. Restrictions on the availability
	of foreign currency may affect the ability of our PRC subsidiaries and consolidated affiliated entities to remit sufficient foreign currency to pay dividends or other payments to us, or otherwise satisfy their foreign currency denominated
	obligations. See &#147;Item 3. Key Information &#151; D. Risk Factors &#151; Risks Related to Our Corporate Structure &#151; We may rely principally on dividends and other distributions on equity paid by our PRC and HK subsidiaries to fund any cash
	and financing requirements we may have. Any limitation on the ability of our PRC and HK subsidiaries to pay dividends to us could have a material adverse effect on our ability to conduct our business&#148; and &#147;Risk Factors &#151; Risks Related
	to Doing Business in China &#151; Governmental control of currency conversion may limit our ability to utilize our revenues effectively and affect the value of your investment.&#148;

	As an offshore holding company, we are permitted, under PRC laws and regulations, to provide funding from the
	proceeds of our overseas fund raising activities to our PRC subsidiaries only through loans or capital contributions, and to our PRC consolidated affiliated entities only through loans, subject to the satisfaction of the applicable government
	registration and approval requirements. As a result, uncertainties exist as to our ability to provide prompt financial support to our PRC subsidiaries or consolidated affiliated entities when needed. See &#147;Item 3. Key Information&#151;D. Risk
	Factors&#151;Risks Related to Our Corporate Structure&#151;PRC regulation of loans to, and direct investment in, PRC entities by offshore holding companies and governmental control of currency conversion may restrict or prevent us from making loans
	to our PRC subsidiaries and consolidated affiliated entities or making additional capital contributions to our PRC subsidiaries, which may materially and adversely affect our liquidity and our ability to fund and expand our business.&#148;
	Notwithstanding the foregoing, our wholly-owned subsidiaries may use their own retained earnings to provide financial support to our consolidated affiliated entities in the PRC either through extended payment terms on amounts due to NQ Beijing from
	our consolidated affiliated entities, or via entrusted loans from our subsidiaries to consolidated affiliated entities, or direct loans to the nominee shareholders of consolidated affiliated entities, which would be contributed to the consolidated

	period which typically lasts three months. We offer internal continuing education training programs for our employees on a variety of topics, including (i) general training on topics like time management and general business communication, (ii)
	training specific to each of their professional positions, such as training regarding sales strategies and project management, and (iii) management-level training, including training on employee motivation, delegation of authority and stress
	management. We also offer employees outside training opportunities on an as-needed basis.

	. On June 5, 2007, NQ Beijing and the shareholders of Beijing Technology entered into a loan agreement, pursuant
	to which NQ Beijing extended interest-free loans to the shareholders of Beijing Technology with an aggregate amount of RMB 6,122,500. In addition, NQ Mobile Inc. extended a loan in the amount of US$250,000 to the shareholders of Beijing Technology
	with an annual interest rate of 6.0%. In January 2011, NQ Mobile Inc., NQ Beijing and the shareholders of Beijing Technology entered into an agreement, which provides that the sole purpose of the loans in the amounts of RMB6,122,500 and US$250,000
	is to provide funds necessary for the capital injection of Beijing Technology and that the obligations of the shareholders of Beijing Technology to repay such loans can only be fully performed by the sale of all of its equity interests to NQ Beijing
	or its designated representative(s) pursuant to the equity disposition agreement. On May 31, 2012, NQ Beijing and the shareholders of Beijing Technology entered into another loan agreement, pursuant to which NQ Beijing extended interest-free loans
	to the shareholders of Beijing Technology with an aggregate amount of RMB 40,000,000. On November 17, 2015 NQ Beijing and shareholders of Beijing Technology entered into a loan agreement, pursuant to which the loan agreement entered into on June 5,

	Beijing&#146;s prior written consent, the shareholders of Beijing Technology shall not approve any transaction which may significantly affect its assets, operations or liabilities. The term of the loan agreements is ten years, and may be extended if

	, Civil Action No. 15 CIV 06385 (S.D.N.Y.), was filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York against our company and certain of our former and current officers. On September 3, 2015, plaintiffs
	filed a First Amended Complaint. On November 20, 2015, plaintiffs filed a Second Amended Complaint against us, our former co-chief executive officer Omar Sharif Khan and our vice president of capital markets Matthew Mathison. The Second Amended
	Complaint alleges that various press releases and other disclosures made by our company during the alleged class period contained material misstatements and omissions, in violation of the federal securities laws, and artificially inflated the value
	of our company&#146;s ADSs. The Second Amended Complaint states that the plaintiffs seek to represent a class of persons who allegedly suffered damages as a result of their trading activities related to our ADSs from November 1, 2013 to May 15,
	2015, and alleges violations of Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, 15 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 78(b) and 78t(a), and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder, 17 C.F.R. &#167; 240.10b-5. On January 19, 2016, the company, Khan and

	conference. On January 20, 2016, Khan submitted a supplemental letter to the court. On January 26, 2016, plaintiffs submitted a letter to the court responding to the letters submitted by our company, Mathison and Khan, in which plaintiffs sought
	leave to amend the Second Amended Complaint. On February 16, 2016, the court issued a ruling that plaintiffs should promptly file, if they can consistent with Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11, a Third Amended Complaint and then comply with the
	notice and lead plaintiff provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act. On March 3, 2016, plaintiffs filed a Third Amended Complaint. The action remains in its preliminary stages. We believe the case is without merit and intend to

	On October 25, 2013, our board of directors formed a special committee, or the Special Committee, to conduct an independent review of certain
	allegations raised in a report issued by Muddy Waters LLC dated October 24, 2013 (and in subsequent reports and letters issued through January 13, 2014). The Special Committee was comprised of the four independent directors of our company at the
	time, Ms. Ying Han and Messrs. William Tiewei Li, Xiuming Tao and Jun Zhang, with Ms. Han serving as the chairwoman of the committee. The committee was authorized to retain independent advisors in connection with its investigation. The Special
	Committee subsequently retained the global law firm of Shearman &amp; Sterling LLP to conduct the independent review, and Shearman &amp; Sterling LLP in turn engaged Deloitte &amp; Touche Financial Advisory Services Limited as forensic accountants
	to assist it in the matter (together, the &#147;Investigation Team&#148;). On June 4, 2014, the results of the independent investigation conducted by the Special Committee were announced. The announcement described the scope of the work carried out
	during the more than seven month investigation, including substantive procedures performed to investigate each allegation. The Special Committee reported it did not find any evidence that we had engaged in the fraudulent conduct alleged by Muddy
	Waters LLC. It also noted that the Investigation Team had not been able to verify that certain devices containing electronic data that it collected and copied contained all responsive information at the time the copies were made, and that on some
	devices there were indications that data might be missing, for which there was not a credible explanation.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:8%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Subsequent to the release of
	the Special Committee&#146;s findings, our audit committee engaged DLA Piper LLP as its outside counsel to advise it with respect to matters relating to the completion of the audit, including matters relating to the observation that some data might
	be missing on some devices which was identified by the Special Committee. With respect to devices as to which there were indications that data might be missing, the audit committee&#146;s counsel retained the computer forensic consultant, Control
	Risks Group, to conduct a thorough examination of images made from devices that were collected and imaged during the course of the Special Committee&#146;s investigation and hired Stroz Friedberg to review the examination protocol. As a result of
	this forensic examination, the audit committee&#146;s advisers were able to recover and review many files on certain devices, which files had been deleted between the October&nbsp;24 publication of the Muddy Waters report and the collection of data
	from those devices by the Special Committee. None were relevant to the Muddy Waters allegations. The audit committee&#146;s advisers performed additional forensic procedures to recover documents deleted prior to system reinstallations on certain of
	the devices following the publication of the Muddy Waters report, and similarly recovered no documents relevant to the allegations or Special Committee&#146;s investigation. In sum, the Audit Committee found no evidence of an effort to prevent the
	collection of documents or data relevant to the Special Committee&#146;s investigation.

	We have responded to requests from the Staff of
	both the New York Stock Exchange and the Securities and Exchange Commission related to the Muddy Waters allegations and the Special Committee investigation. There are no outstanding requests, although either the SEC or NYSE Staff may make further
	requests and we intend to cooperate with such requests.

	Conversion
</I>
</B>
	Each Class B common share is convertible into one Class A common share at any time by the
	holder thereof. Class A common shares are not convertible into Class B common shares under any circumstances. If at any time our three founders, Dr. Henry Yu Lin, Mr. Xu Zhou and Dr. Vincent Wenyong Shi and their affiliates collectively own less
	than 5% of the total number of the issued and outstanding Class B common shares, each issued and outstanding Class B common share shall be automatically and immediately converted into one Class A common share, and we shall not issue any Class B
	common shares thereafter. Upon any sale, pledge, transfer, assignment or disposition of Class B common shares by a holder thereof to any person or entity which is not an affiliate of such holder, or a founder or a founder&#146;s affiliate, each such
	Class B common share shall be automatically and immediately converted into one Class A common share, provided that (a) except as otherwise provided in our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association, a change in the beneficial
	ownership of Class B common shares from a holder of Class B common shares to an affiliate of such holder or to one of our founders or to a founder&#146;s affiliate shall not cause a conversion and (b) any sale, pledge, transfer, assignment or
	disposition of Class B common shares by a holder thereof effected as part of the creation of any security interest or other encumbrance over such Class B common shares (including, without limitation, any transfer of legal title to such Class B
	common shares effected as part of the creation of any security interest or other encumbrance over such Class B common shares) shall be exempt from, and shall not trigger, the automatic conversion from Class B common shares to Class A common shares
	unless and until the legal title to such Class B common shares is transferred to any person or entity which is not an affiliate of such holder (or one of our founders or a founder&#146;s affiliate) as a result of the enforcement of such security
	interest or other encumbrance. In addition, if at any time more than fifty percent (50%) of the ultimate beneficial ownership of any holder of Class B common shares (other than one of our founders or a founder&#146;s affiliate) changes, each such
	Class B common share shall be automatically and immediately converted into one Class A common share. For the avoidance of doubt, the sale, pledge, transfer, assignment or disposition of Class B common shares by a holder thereof to any of the
	following shall be exempt from, and shall not trigger, the automatic conversion contemplated herein: (i) one of our founders or an affiliate of one or more our founders or (ii) an affiliate of such holder.

	The Companies Law permits mergers and consolidations between Cayman Islands companies and between Cayman Islands
	companies and non-Cayman Islands companies. For these purposes, (a) &#147;merger&#148; means the merging of two or more constituent companies and the vesting of their undertaking, property and liabilities in one of such companies as the surviving
	company and (b) a &#147;consolidation&#148; means the combination of two or more constituent companies into a combined company and the vesting of the undertaking, property and liabilities of such companies to the consolidated company. In order to
	effect such a merger or consolidation, the directors of each constituent company must approve a written plan of merger or consolidation, which must then be authorized by (a) a special resolution of the shareholders of each constituent company, and
	(b) such other authorization, if any, as may be specified in such constituent company&#146;s articles of association. The written plan of merger or consolidation must be filed with the Registrar of Companies together with a declaration as to the
	solvency of the consolidated or surviving company, a list of the assets and liabilities of each constituent company and an undertaking that a copy of the certificate of merger or consolidation will be given to the members and creditors of each
	constituent company and that notification of the merger or consolidation will be published in the Cayman Islands Gazette. Dissenting shareholders have the right to be paid the fair value of their shares (which, if not agreed between the parties,
	will be determined by the Cayman Islands court) if they follow the required procedures, subject to certain exceptions. Court approval is not required for a merger or consolidation which is effected in compliance with these statutory procedures.

</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:8%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Under Delaware corporate law, a director of a Delaware corporation has a fiduciary duty to the corporation and its shareholders. This duty has
	two components: the duty of care and the duty of loyalty. The duty of care requires that a director act in good faith, with the care that an ordinarily prudent person would exercise under similar circumstances. Under this duty, a director must
	inform himself of and disclose to shareholders, all material information reasonably available regarding a significant transaction. The duty of loyalty requires that a director act in a manner he or she reasonably believes to be in the best interests
	of the corporation. He or she must not use his or her corporate position for personal gain or advantage. This duty prohibits self-dealing by a director and mandates that the best interest of the corporation and its shareholders take precedence over

	the action taken was in the best interests of the corporation. However, this presumption may be rebutted by evidence of a breach of one of the fiduciary duties. Should such evidence be presented concerning a transaction by a director, a director

	As a matter of
	Cayman Islands law, a director of a Cayman Islands company is in the position of a fiduciary with respect to the company and therefore he owes the following duties to the company &#150; a duty to act in good faith in the best interests of the
	company, a duty not to make a personal profit based on his or her position as director (unless the company permits him to do so), a duty not to put himself in a position where the interests of the company conflict with his or her personal interest
	or his or her duty to a third party and a duty to exercise powers for the purpose for which such powers were intended. A director of a Cayman Islands company owes to the company a duty to act with skill and care. It was previously considered that a
	director need not exhibit in the performance of his or her duties a greater degree of skill than may reasonably be expected from a person of his or her knowledge and experience. However, English and Commonwealth courts have moved towards an
	objective standard with regard to the required skill and care and these authorities are likely to be followed in the Cayman Islands.

	The Delaware General Corporation Law contains a business combination statute applicable to Delaware public corporations whereby, unless the
	corporation has specifically elected not to be governed by such statute by amendment to its certificate of incorporation or bylaws that is approved by its shareholders, it is prohibited from engaging in certain business combinations with an
	&#147;interested shareholder&#148; for three years following the date that such person becomes an interested shareholder. An interested shareholder generally is a person or a group who or which owns or owned 15% or more of the target&#146;s
	outstanding voting stock or who or which is an affiliate or associate of the corporation and owned 15% or more of the corporation&#146;s outstanding voting stock within the past three years. This has the effect of limiting the ability of a potential
	acquirer to make a two-tiered bid for the target in which all shareholders would not be treated equally. The statute does not apply if, among other things, prior to the date on which such shareholder becomes an interested shareholder, the board of
	directors approves either the business combination or the transaction which resulted in the person becoming an interested shareholder. This encourages any potential acquirer of a Delaware corporation to negotiate the terms of any acquisition
	transaction with the target&#146;s board of directors.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:8%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Cayman Islands law has no comparable statute. As a result, we cannot avail
	ourselves of the types of protections afforded by the Delaware business combination statute. However, although Cayman Islands law does not regulate transactions between a company and its significant shareholders, it does provide that such
	transactions must be entered into bona fide in the best interests of the company and for a proper corporate purpose and not with the effect of constituting a fraud on the minority shareholders.

	income of foreign enterprises, such as dividends paid by a PRC subsidiary to its overseas parent that is not a PRC resident enterprise and has no establishment in the PRC, will normally be subject to PRC withholding tax at a rate of 10%, unless
	there are applicable treaties that reduce such rate. Under the Arrangement between the PRC and Hong Kong Special Administrative Region on the Avoidance of Double Taxation and Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with respect to Taxes on Income and Capital,
	such dividend withholding tax rate is reduced to 5% if a Hong Kong resident enterprise owns over 25% of the PRC company distributing the dividends. As our Hong Kong subsidiary owns 100% of NQ Beijing, under the aforesaid arrangement, any dividends

	investment companies, real estate investment trusts, pension plans, cooperatives, broker-dealers, partnerships and their partners, and tax-exempt organizations (including private foundations)), holders who are not U.S. Holders, holders who own

	have a functional currency other than the United States dollar, all of whom may be subject to tax rules that differ significantly from those summarized below. In addition, this summary does not discuss any alternative minimum tax, state, local or
	non-United States tax considerations any non-income tax considerations (including gift or estate tax), or the Medicare tax. Each U.S. Holder is urged to consult with its tax advisor regarding the United States federal, state, local, and non-United

	A non-United States corporation, such as our company, will be classified as a &#147;passive foreign investment company&#148;, or
	&#147;PFIC&#148;, for United States federal income tax purposes for any taxable year if either (i) 75% or more of its gross income for such year consists of certain types of &#147;passive&#148; income or (ii) 50% or more of the value of its average
	quarterly assets (as generally determined on the basis of fair market value) during such year produce or are held for the production of passive income. For this purpose, cash and assets readily convertible into cash are categorized as passive assets
	and the company&#146;s unbooked intangibles are taken into account for determining the value of its assets. We will be treated as owning a proportionate share of the assets and earning a proportionate share of the income of any other corporation in
	which we own, directly or indirectly, more than 25% (by value) of the stock. Although the law in this regard is unclear, we treat our VIE (Beijing Technology) and its subsidiaries as being owned by us for United States federal income tax purposes,
	not only because we exercise effective control over the operation of such entity but also because we are entitled to substantially all of the economic benefits associated with such entity, and, as a result, we consolidate the operating results of

	Assuming that we are the owner of our VIE and its subsidiaries for United States federal income
	tax purposes, although not free from doubt, we do not believe that we were a PFIC for United States federal income tax purposes, in the taxable year ended December 31, 2015. However, there is a significant risk that we will become a PFIC for our
	current taxable year ending December 31, 2016 and future taxable years because of our significant cash balances and because the value of our assets for purposes of the PFIC test will generally be determined by reference to the market price of our
	ADSs. Accordingly, fluctuations in the market price of our ADSs may cause us to become a PFIC for the current taxable year or future taxable years. It is also possible, that the Internal Revenue Service may challenge our classification or valuation
	of our goodwill and other unbooked intangibles or challenge the classification of certain of our non-passive revenues as passive royalty income, which may result in our company being, or becoming a PFIC. The determination of whether we will be or
	become a PFIC will also depend, in part, upon the nature of our income and assets over time, which are subject to change from year to year. There can be no assurance that our business plans will not change in a manner that will affect our PFIC
	status. Because there are uncertainties in the application of the relevant rules and PFIC status is a fact-intensive determination made on an annual basis, no assurance can be given with respect to our PFIC status for any taxable year.

	As an alternative to the foregoing rules, a U.S. Holder of &#147;marketable stock&#148; in a PFIC
	may make a mark-to-market election for such stock to elect out of the tax treatment discussed above. The mark-to-market election is available only for &#147;marketable stock,&#148; which is stock that is traded in other than deminimis quantities on
	at least 15 days during each calendar quarter (&#147;regularly traded&#148;) on a qualified exchange or other market, as defined in applicable United States Treasury regulations. Our ADSs are listed on the New York Stock Exchange, which is a
	qualified exchange or market for these purposes. We anticipate that our ADSs should qualify as being regularly traded, but no assurances may be given in this regard. If a U.S. Holder makes a valid mark-to-market election, the U.S. Holder will
	generally (i) include as ordinary income for each taxable year that we are a PFIC the excess, if any, of the fair market value of ADSs held at the end of the taxable year over the adjusted tax basis of such ADSs and (ii) deduct as an ordinary loss
	the excess, if any, of the adjusted tax basis of the ADSs over the fair market value of such ADSs held at the end of the taxable year, but only to the extent of the net amount previously included in income as a result of the mark-to-market election.
	The U.S. Holder&#146;s adjusted tax basis in the ADSs would be adjusted to reflect any income or loss resulting from the mark-to-market election. Gain on the sale or other disposition of ADSs would be treated as ordinary income, and loss on the sale
	or other disposition of ADSs would be treated as an ordinary loss, but only to the extent of the amount previously included in income as a result of the mark-to-market election. If a U.S. Holder makes a mark-to-market election in respect of a

	dollar over the following three years. Between July 2008 and June 2010, this appreciation halted and the exchange rate between the RMB and the U.S. dollar remained within a narrow band. Since June 2010, the RMB has fluctuated against the U.S.
	dollar, at times significantly and unpredictably. It is difficult to predict how market forces or PRC or U.S. government policy may impact the exchange rate between the RMB and the U.S. dollar in the future.

	To the extent that we need to convert U.S. dollars into RMB for capital expenditures and working
	capital and other business purposes, appreciation of the RMB against the U.S. dollar would have an adverse effect on the RMB amount we would receive from the conversion. Conversely, if we decide to convert RMB into U.S. dollars for the purpose of
	making payments for dividends on our common shares or ADSs, strategic acquisitions or investments or other business purposes, appreciation of the U.S. dollar against the RMB would have a negative effect on the U.S. dollar amount available to us.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:8%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	A majority of our revenues and costs are denominated in RMB. At the Cayman Islands holding company level, we may receive dividends and
	other fees paid to us by our subsidiary and consolidated affiliated entities in China. Any significant revaluation of RMB may materially and adversely affect our cash flows, revenues, earnings and financial position, and the value of, and any
	dividends payable on, our ADSs in U.S. dollars. For example, an appreciation of RMB against the U.S. dollar would make any new RMB denominated investments or expenditures more costly to us, to the extent that we need to convert U.S. dollars into RMB
	for such purposes. Conversely, a significant depreciation of the RMB against the U.S. dollar may significantly reduce the U.S. dollar equivalent of our earnings, which in turn could adversely affect the price of our ADSs.

	Very limited hedging options are available in China to reduce our exposure to exchange rate fluctuations. To date, we have not entered into
	any hedging transactions in an effort to reduce our exposure to foreign currency exchange risk. While we may decide to enter into hedging transactions in the future, the availability and effectiveness of these hedges may be limited and we may not be
	able to adequately hedge our exposure or at all. In addition, our currency exchange losses may be magnified by PRC exchange control regulations that restrict our ability to convert RMB into foreign currency. As a result, fluctuations in exchange
	rates may have a negative effect on your investment.

	The depositary fees payable upon the issuance and

	bank for cancellation. The brokers in turn charge these fees to their clients. Depositary fees payable in connection with distributions of cash or securities to ADS holders and the depositary services fee are charged by the depositary bank to the
	holders of record of ADSs as of the applicable ADS record date.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:8%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The depositary fees payable for cash distributions are generally deducted
	from the cash being distributed or by selling a portion of distributable property to pay the fees. In the case of distributions other than cash (i.e., share dividends, rights), the depositary bank charges the applicable fee to the ADS record date
	holders concurrent with the distribution. In the case of ADSs registered in the name of the investor (whether certificated or uncertificated in direct registration), the depositary bank sends invoices to the applicable record date ADS holders. In
	the case of ADSs held in brokerage and custodian accounts (via DTC), the depositary bank generally collects its fees through the systems provided by DTC (whose nominee is the registered holder of the ADSs held in DTC) from the brokers and custodians
	holding ADSs in their DTC accounts. The brokers and custodians who hold their clients&#146; ADSs in DTC accounts in turn charge their clients&#146; accounts the amount of the fees paid to the depositary banks.

	We conducted

	and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit

	A company&#146;s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide
	reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company&#146;s internal control over financial
	reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable
	assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with
	authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company&#146;s assets that could have a material effect

	On December 23, 2014, our board of directors authorized a share repurchase program, or the 2014 Repurchase Plan, under which we may repurchase up to US$80 million of our shares over the next 12 months. The share
	repurchases may be made from time to time on the open market, in privately negotiated transactions, in block trades and/or through other legally permissible means, depending on market conditions and in accordance with applicable rules and
	regulations. We funded repurchases made under the 2014 Repurchase Plan from our existing cash balance. During the year ended December 31, 2015, we purchased 263,999 ADSs with a total consideration of approximately US$1.3 million from the open market
	under the 2014 Repurchase Plan, which was terminated as of December 23, 2015.

	Certain corporate governance practices in the Cayman Islands,
	which is our home country, differ significantly from the New York Stock Exchange corporate governance listing standards. For example, neither the Companies Law of the Cayman Islands nor our memorandum and articles of association requires a majority
	of our directors to be independent and we could include non-independent directors as members of our compensation committee and corporate governance and nominating committee, and our independent directors would not necessarily hold regularly
	scheduled meetings at which only independent directors are present. Currently, we do not plan to rely on home country practice with respect to any other corporate governance matter. However, if we choose to follow home country practice in the
	future, our shareholders may be afforded less protection than they otherwise would under the New York Stock Exchange corporate governance listing standards applicable to U.S. domestic issuers.

	We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of NQ Mobile Inc. (the &#147;Company&#148;) as of December 31, 2014 and 2015, and
	the related consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss), changes in equity and cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2014 and 2015. These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company&#146;s

</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	We conducted our
	audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements
	are free of material misstatement. An audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management,
	as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial
	position of NQ Mobile Inc. as of December 31, 2014 and 2015, and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2014 and 2015 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the
	United States of America.

	We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United

	Commission, and our report dated April 6, 2016 expressed an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Company&#146;s internal control over financial reporting.

	Group&#146;s business was operated by Beijing NQ Technology Co. Ltd. (&#147;Beijing Technology&#148;), a company wholly owned and controlled by the Controlling Shareholders, which commenced operations on October&nbsp;21, 2005. By entering into a
	series of agreements (collectively, &#147;NQ VIE Agreements&#148;) with the Controlling Shareholders and NQ Beijing, Beijing Technology became a variable interest entity whose primary beneficiary is NQ Beijing. Consequently, the Company as the

	FL Mobile Inc. was incorporated as a limited liability company under the laws of the
	Cayman Islands on January&nbsp;21, 2013. FL Mobile Inc. was 100% owned by the Company until May 2014, when the Company entered into a share purchase agreement with Bison Mobile Limited, pursuant to which Bison Mobile Limited agreed to purchase up to
	3.75% of equity interests in FL Mobile Inc., and the Company have the right but not the obligation to sell up to 2.13% of equity interests in FL Mobile Inc. to other third party investors. As part of this transaction, the Company conducted a

	Mobile Inc. if FL Mobile Inc. fails to conduct a qualified listing in a certain time. This transaction was closed in the fourth quarter of 2014. In 2015, FL Mobile Inc. failed to achieve a qualified listing and two of the shareholders, Bison Mobile
	Limited and another non-controlling shareholder required the Company to redeem the equity interests they hold. As of December 31, 2015, the remaining non-controlling shareholders hold 0.91% of equity interests in FL Mobile Inc. See Note 14 &#150;

	arrangement to the FL Mobile Divestment, Dr. Vincent Wenyong Shi, the chairman of FL Mobile, entered into a termination and share purchase agreement with FL Mobile and a subsidiary of the Group (the &#147;Agreement&#148;). Pursuant to which, Dr.

	The Ministry of Commerce of PRC (&#147;MOC&#148;) published a discussion draft of the proposed Foreign Investment Law (the &#147;Draft&#148;)
	in January 2015 aiming to, upon its enactment, replace the trio of existing laws regulating foreign investment in China. The Draft embodies an expected PRC regulatory trend to rationalize its foreign investment regulatory regime in line with
	prevailing international practice and the legislative efforts to unify the corporate legal requirements for both foreign and domestic investments. The MOC is currently soliciting comments on the Draft and substantial uncertainties exist with respect
	to its enactment timetable, interpretation and implementation. The Draft, if enacted as proposed, may materially impact the viability of our current corporate structure, corporate governance and business operations. The Draft expands the definition
	of foreign investment and introduces the principle of &#147;actual control&#148; in determining whether a company is considered a VIE.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Under the Draft, variable interest entities that are controlled via contractual arrangement would be deemed as VIEs, if they are ultimately
	&#147;controlled&#148; by foreign investors. Therefore, for any companies with a VIE structure in an industry category that is on the &#147;negative list,&#148; the VIE structure may be deemed legitimate only if the ultimate controlling person(s)
	is/are of PRC nationality (either PRC companies or PRC citizens). Conversely, if the actual controlling person(s) is/are of foreign nationalities, then the variable interest entities will be treated as VIEs and any operation in the industry category
	on the &#147;negative list&#148; without market entry clearance may be considered as illegal. Moreover, for the enterprises which are not incorporated under the laws of China (foreign investors) but are &#147;controlled&#148; by Chinese investors,
	they may submit documentary evidence to apply for identifying their investment as the investment by Chinese investors when they applying for the market entry clearance to engage in any investment as set out in the &#147;negative list&#148; in China.
	The competent authorities of foreign investment will grant the review opinion on whether the said investment is identified as the investment by Chinese investors.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	In conclusion, if the Draft enacted as proposed, it is possible that the Company&#146;s conduct of certain of its operations and businesses
	through the VIEs could be found by PRC authorities to be in violation of PRC laws and regulations prohibiting or restricting foreign ownership of companies that engage in such operations and businesses. If such a finding were made, regulatory
	authorities with jurisdiction over the licensing and operation of such businesses would have broad discretion in dealing with such a violation, including levying fines, confiscating the Company&#146;s income, revoking the business or operating
	licenses of the affected businesses, requiring the Company to restructure its ownership structure or operations, or requiring the Company to discontinue all or any portion of its operations. Any of these actions could cause significant disruption to
	the Company&#146;s business operations, and have a material adverse impact on the Company&#146;s cash flows, financial position and operating performance. The Company&#146;s management considers the possibility of such a finding by PRC regulatory
	authorities to be remote.

	In addition, it is possible that the VIE Agreements would not be enforceable in China if PRC
	government authorities or courts were to find that such agreements contravene PRC laws and regulations or are otherwise not enforceable for public policy reasons. In the event that the Company is unable to enforce any of these agreements, the
	Company would not be able to exert effective control over the affected VIEs and consequently, the results of operations, assets and liabilities of the affected VIEs and their subsidiaries would not be included in the Company&#146;s consolidated
	financial statements. If such were the case, the Company&#146;s cash flows, financial position and operating performance would be materially adversely affected. The Company&#146;s agreements with respect to its consolidated VIEs are approved and in
	place. The Company&#146;s management believes that such agreements are enforceable, and considers it a remote possibility that PRC regulatory authorities with jurisdiction over the Company&#146;s operations and contractual relationships would find
	the agreements to be unenforceable under existing laws.

	The
	Company accounts for its business combinations using the purchase method of accounting in accordance with ASC 805: Business Combinations. The purchase method accounting requires that the consideration transferred to be allocated to the assets,
	including separately identifiable assets and liabilities the Company acquired based on their estimated fair values. The consideration transferred of an acquisition is measured as the aggregate of the fair values at the date of exchange of the assets
	given, liabilities incurred, and equity instruments issued as well as the contingent considerations and all contractual contingencies as of the acquisition date. The costs directly attributable to the acquisition are expensed as incurred.
	Identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired or assumed are measured separately at their fair value as of the acquisition date, irrespective of the extent of any non-controlling interests. The excess of (i)&nbsp;the total of
	cost of acquisition, fair value of the non-controlling interests and acquisition date fair value of any previously held equity interest in the acquired entity over (ii)&nbsp;the fair value of the identifiable net assets of the acquired entity is
	recorded as goodwill. If the cost of acquisition is less than the fair value of the net assets of the subsidiary acquired, the difference is recognized directly in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income.

	The determination and allocation of fair values to the identifiable assets acquired, liabilities assumed and non-controlling interests is
	based on various assumptions and valuation methodologies requiring considerable management judgment. The most significant variables in these valuations are discount rates, terminal values, the number of years on which to base the cash flow
	projections, as well as the assumptions and estimates used to determine the cash inflows and outflows. The Company determines discount rates to be used based on the risks inherent in the related activity&#146;s current business model and industry
	comparisons. Terminal values are based on the expected life of assets, forecasted life cycle and forecasted cash flows over the relevant period.

	The preparation of these consolidated financial statements in conformity with US&nbsp;GAAP requires management to make estimates and
	assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and the related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. Management makes its estimates based on historical experience and on various other
	assumptions it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Significant accounting
	estimates reflected in the Company&#146;s consolidated financial statements mainly include the allowance for doubtful accounts, the valuation allowance of deferred tax assets, the estimated useful lives of long-lived assets, the impairment
	assessment of long-lived assets and equity investments, the valuation and recognition of share-based compensation, and goodwill and fair value of identifiable assets and liabilities acquired through business combination.

	The
	Company tests goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level on an annual basis as of November&nbsp;1 and between annual tests when an event occurs or circumstances change that could indicate that the asset might be impaired. Commencing in
	September 2011, in accordance with the FASB revised guidance on &#147;Testing of Goodwill for Impairment&#148;, a company first has the option to assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a
	reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If the company decides, as a result of its qualitative assessment, that it is more-likely-than- not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, the quantitative
	impairment test is mandatory. Otherwise, no further testing is required. The quantitative impairment test consists of a two-step goodwill impairment test. The first step compares the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying amount. If the
	fair value of each reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, goodwill is not considered to be impaired and the second step will not be required. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the second step compares the
	implied fair value of goodwill to the carrying value of a reporting unit&#146;s goodwill. The implied fair value of goodwill is determined in a manner similar to accounting for a business combination with the allocation of the assessed fair value
	determined in the first step to the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit. The excess of the fair value of the reporting unit over the amounts assigned to the assets and liabilities is the implied fair value of goodwill. This allocation
	process is only performed for purposes of evaluating goodwill impairment and does not result in an entry to adjust the value of any assets or liabilities. An impairment loss is recognized for any excess in the carrying value of goodwill over the
	implied fair value of goodwill.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Application of a goodwill impairment test requires significant management judgment, including the
	identification of reporting units, assigning assets and liabilities to reporting units, assigning goodwill to reporting units, and determining the fair value of each reporting unit. The judgment in estimating the fair value of reporting units
	includes estimating future cash flows, determining appropriate discount rates and making other assumptions. Changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value for each reporting unit. The Group has
	performed impairment test on November 1, 2015 for the fiscal year of 2015, and the Group conclude there is no goodwill impairment during the impairment test.

	When a portion of a reporting unit that constitutes a business is to be disposed of, goodwill

	The carrying amounts of long-lived assets other than goodwill and intangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in

	In May of 2014, the FASB issued Topic 606, &#147;Revenue from Contracts with Customers&#148;. This topic clarifies the principles for
	recognizing revenue and develops a common revenue standard for U.S. GAAP and IFRS. Simultaneously, this topic supersedes the revenue recognition requirements in Topic 605, Revenue Recognition, and most industry-specific guidance throughout the
	Industry Topics of the Codification. The core principle of the guidance requires an entity to recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity
	expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. To achieve that core principle, an entity should apply the five steps: 1) identify the contract(s) with a customer; 2) identify the performance obligations in the contract; 3) determine
	the transaction price; 4) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; 5) recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation. The amendments are effective for annual reporting periods
	beginning after December&nbsp;15, 2016, including interim periods within that reporting period. Early application is not permitted. This amendments shall be applied retrospectively either to each prior reporting periods or with the cumulative effect
	of initially applying this amendments recognized at the date of initial application. In August of 2015, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (&#147;ASU&#148;) 2015-14, Revenue from Contracts with Customer (Topic 606): Deferral of the
	Effective Date. This ASU was fairly straight forward and simple as it defers the effective date of ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, for all entities. With the issuance of ASU 2015-14, public business entities should apply the

	In November 2015, the Group entered into an agreement with former member of management of
	NationSky and a third party company to divest all of the equity interests of NationSky for a total cash consideration of RMB510,000. On December 30, 2015, the deal was closed with all the consideration received by the Group. The Group recorded a
	gain from the disposal of a subsidiary of approximately $56,211 related to the completion of the NationSky divestment for the year ended December 31, 2015. Because the Group still keeps and continuously expands the enterprise mobility service
	business line, thus the sale of NationSky does not represent a strategic shift of the Group; the Group does not consider the disposal of NationSky as discontinued operation on the consolidated financial statements. The carrying amount of goodwill
	and intangible assets result from the acquisition of NationSky, which are US$2,033, US$1,905 are entirely included as part of the carrying amount of NationSky in determining the gain of the disposal rather than using a relative fair value method as
	NationSky has been operated as a standalone entity. The goodwill remaining in the portion of the enterprise reporting unit to be retained was tested for impairment using its adjusted carrying amount at the date of disposal and no impairment was

	In June 2015, The Group
	treated the fact that the total fair value of NQ Shenzhen was lower than the carrying value of NQ Shenzhen&#146;s net assets as an indicator that the goodwill associated with NQ Shenzhen should be impaired. As NQ Shenzhen is a standalone entity
	since acquired, the goodwill is written off entirely rather than allocated it based on relatively fair value. Accordingly, US$2,241 of goodwill is impaired. Meanwhile, the intangible assets acquired as part of NQ Shenzhen acquisition is recorded in
	impairment loss of US$298.

	Prior to the acquisition, Ruifeng did not prepare its

	performance of all companies acquired by the Group and a comparison of Ruifeng&#146;s and the Group&#146;s financial performance for the fiscal year prior to the acquisition, the Group did not consider Ruifeng on its own to be material to the Group.
	Thus the Group&#146;s management believes that the presentation of pro forma financial information with respect to the results of operations of the Group for the business combination is impractical.

	acquired by the Group and a comparison of Best Partners&#146; and the Group&#146;s financial performance for the fiscal year prior to the acquisition, the Group did not consider Best Partners on its own to be material to the Group. Thus the

	The fair value of non-controlling interest in Huayong has been determined in the valuation mainly
	based on the number of shares held by non-controlling shareholders and the equity value under non-controlling basis close to the acquisition date. The equity value under non-controlling basis was determined using discounted cash flow method. A

	Prior to the acquisition, Huayong did not prepare its

	performance of all companies acquired by the Group and a comparison of Huayong&#146;s and the Group&#146;s financial performance for the fiscal year prior to the acquisition, the Group did not consider Huayong on its own to be material to the Group.
	Thus the Group&#146;s management believes that the presentation of pro forma financial information with respect to the results of operations of the Group for the business combination is impractical.

	The Company test goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level on an annual basis as of November 1, and
	between annual tests when an event occurs or circumstances change that could indicate that the asset might be impaired. As of November&nbsp;1, 2015, the Company tested impairment of goodwill at the level of reporting units, which comprise of mobile

	The Company first assessed qualitative factors to determine whether
	it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. For those reporting units where it is determined that it&#146;s more likely than not that their fair values are less than the units&#146; carrying
	amounts, the Company will perform the first step of a two-step quantitative goodwill impairment test. After performing the assessment, if the carrying amounts of the reporting units are higher than their fair values, the Company will perform the
	second step of the two-step quantitative goodwill impairment test.

	In performing the assessment, the Company took into consideration all
	of the events and circumstances listed in ASC&nbsp;350, in addition to other entity-specific factors. For the reporting unit of security and others, where it was determined that it was more likely than not that its fair value was less than the
	unit&#146;s carrying amount after performing the qualitative assessment, the Company performed the first step of a two-step quantitative&nbsp;goodwill&nbsp;impairment test. For the two-step&nbsp;goodwill&nbsp;impairment test, the Company estimated
	the fair value with the income approach, and considered factors that included expected future cash flows, growth rates and discount rates. The fair value was indicated to be higher than its carrying amount; therefore, the second step testing was
	unnecessary.

	The Group utilized the discounted cash flow (DCF) method to determine the fair value of the
	investment in NQ Guotai. Significant unobservable input used in the DCF model was the weighted average cost of capital of 23%. For investment made by NQ Guotai with recent financing, the Group utilized the option pricing model (the &#147;OPM&#148;)
	to allocate the total equity value to each class of equity. Estimates of the volatility for the OPM were 52% based on the historical volatility of ordinary shares of a group of comparable, publicly-traded companies. Interest rate used in OPM is
	based on US Sovereign Strips plus country risk spread at time close to the liquidation events as of valuation date of 1.34%. Estimates of expected life used in OPM were based on the estimated time to liquidation events of 3.87 years. Significant
	changes in any of the unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement could result in a significantly lower or higher fair value. For the Yuanxin Fund, Qingzhou Fund and Taiyue Wutong Fund, the Company utilized price of recent investment
	method to determine the fair value.

	shares to the Authorized Grant Pool (the &#147;Annual Increase Amount&#148;). The Annual Increase Amount is defined as the number of shares underlying all awards granted in the previous year that are still outstanding. As of December&nbsp;31, 2013,

	On January&nbsp;8, 2012, the Group granted 10,
	000,000 restricted shares of the Company to the Co-Chief Executive Officer (&#147;Co-CEO&#148;) of the Company. Of the 10,000,000 restricted shares, 6,000,000 restricted shares will vest over four years provided that he continues his employment with
	the Company. 25% of the 6,000,000 restricted shares will vest on the first-year anniversary of the employment commencement date and 1/48 of 6,000,000 restricted shares will vest each month over a three-year period thereafter. The remaining 4,000,000
	restricted shares are subject to the achievement of either specific performance or market conditions for each of the next four years. The value of the restricted shares under the market or performance conditions was calculated based on their grant
	date fair values without considering the possibility that the service conditions or performance conditions will be achieved. As all the criteria for establishing grant date were met, the fair value of share-based compensation being recognized for
	these restricted shares was measured on January&nbsp;8, 2012.

	For the 6,000,000 restricted shares that are subject only to the service
	condition, the related compensation expenses are being recognized using graded vesting method over the next four years. For the 4,000,000 restricted shares subject to either performance or market condition, the Company has first determined whether
	or not it was probable that the performance condition would be achieved. The fair value of the restricted shares calculated reflecting the market condition represents the minimum amount that is recognized as compensation cost assuming the requisite
	service is completed, even if the performance or market condition is not met.

	Pursuant to the employment agreement among NQ US, the
	Company and Co-CEO, the Company shall establish a new entity, NQ Global and shall issue 15% equity interest in NQ Global (&#147;NQ Global Shares&#148;) to the Co-CEO for a nominal value. The NQ Global Shares have an embedded put option where the
	Co-CEO has the right in his sole discretion, to require the Company to purchase a portion or all of NQ Global Shares owned by the Co-CEO (&#147;Put Option&#148;) at their fair market value on the exercise date. While the NQ Global Shares are fully
	vested upon their issuance, the Put Option will vest and become exercisable at the rate of 25% of the underlying shares upon each of the first four annual anniversaries of the employment commencement date. All the key terms and conditions were
	substantially agreed among the counterparties in February 2012 and therefore the grant date was established at that time. Since these NQ Global Shares were fully vested upon grant, the entire compensation expenses of US$451 were recognized on the
	grant date. The fair value of 15% equity interest in NQ Global is determined based on the income approach.

	On May&nbsp;8, 2012, the
	Company modified the employment agreement among NQ US, the Company and the Co-CEO so that Co-CEO gave up his 15% equity interest in NQ Global and the related Put Option. Concurrently, the Company granted 9,000,000 restricted shares of the Company to
	the Co-CEO. Of the 9,000,000 restricted shares, 3,500,000 restricted shares are subject to a four-year service condition and the remaining 5,500,000 restricted shares are subject to the achievement of either specific performance or market conditions
	for each of the next four years. This was determined to be a modification to the original award granted to the Co-CEO. As a result, the incremental compensation expense of US$14,019, calculated as the excess of the fair value of the 9,000,000
	restricted shares over the fair value of 15% equity interest in NQ Global on the modification date, was recognized from May&nbsp;8, 2012 over the vesting period.

	The Company estimated the risk free rates based on the yield to maturity of China government bonds denominated
	in US$ as at the option respective valuation dates. Exercise multiple is estimated as the ratio of fair value of stock over the exercise price as at the time the option is exercised, based on a consideration of research study regarding exercise
	pattern based on historical statistical data. Multiples of 2 to 3 were used for the options granted in valuation analysis. Life of the stock options is the contract life of the option. Based on the option agreements, the contract life of the option
	is 10 years from respective grant date. The expected volatility at the date of grant date and each option valuation date was estimated based on historical volatility of comparable companies for the period before the grant date with length
	commensurate with the expected term of the options. The Group has no history or expectation of paying dividends on its common shares. The Group estimated the fair value of the common shares using the income approach or market approach when valuing
	options granted before IPO while closing prices of the Company&#146;s publicly traded shares were adopted when valuing options granted in post-IPO period.

	options granted to employees and senior management, respectively, as of December&nbsp;31, 2015.

	are US$5,961, US$6,208, and US$3,465 for employees and US$851, US$1,751, and US$2,370 for non-employee consultants during the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2013, 2014 and 2015, respectively. Weighted average grant date fair values per option during

	The

	Administration of Taxation jointly issued a circular which stated that for FIEs, all profits accumulated up to December&nbsp;31, 2007 are exempted from withholding tax when they are distributed to foreign investors. Based on the interpretation of
	the current tax laws, management believes that the Company and all its non-PRC subsidiaries are not considered as a &#147;resident enterprise&#148; in China for corporate income tax purposes, but it cannot be certain that the relevant PRC tax

	Determining the income tax expense for these potential assessments and recording the related effects requires management judgments and estimates. The amounts ultimately paid upon resolution of audits could be different from the amounts previously

	Deferred income tax assets are evaluated on the basis of each operating entity. For any entities which are not to be expected to generate enough taxable income in the future, the Group took full allowance against the
	net deferred tax assets. For entities in profit in the year of 2015, the Group assesses the likelihood that the Group will recover the deferred tax assets from future taxable income. The total current deferred income tax assets were resulted from
	deductible advertising expenses, bad debt provision, and accruals. The total non-current deferred income tax assets were resulted from long-term investment impairment and net operating losses.

	As of December 31, 2015, the Group had net operating losses of approximately US$52,923, primarily derived from
	entities in the PRC and Hong Kong, which can be carried forward after certain reconciliation per tax regulation to offset future net profit for income tax purposes. The PRC net operating loss will expire beginning January 1, 2018; and the Hong Kong
	net operating loss can be carried forward without an expiration date. In general, the PRC tax authorities have up to five years to conduct examinations of the tax filings. Accordingly, the PRC subsidiaries&#146; tax years 2011 through 2015 remain
	open to examination by the PRC tax authorities.

	Limited. Similar to the previously filed complaints, the Consolidated Complaint alleges that various press releases, financial statements and other related disclosures made by the Company during the alleged class period contained material
	misstatements and omissions, in violation of the federal securities laws, and that such press releases, financial statements and other related disclosures artificially inflated the value of the Company&#146;s ADSs. The Consolidated Complaint states
	that the lead plaintiff seeks to represent a class of persons who allegedly suffered damages as a result of their trading activities related to the Company&#146;s ADSs from March 6, 2013 to July 3, 2014, and, similar to previous complaints filed in

	When a loss contingency is not both probable and estimable, the Company does not record an accrued liability but discloses the nature and the
	amount of the claim, if material. However, if the loss (or an additional loss in excess of the accrual) is at least reasonably possible, then the Company discloses an estimate of the loss or range of loss, if such estimate can be made and material,
	or states that such estimate is immaterial if it can be estimated but immaterial, or discloses that an estimate cannot be made. The assessments of whether a loss is probable or reasonably possible, and whether the loss or a range of loss is
	estimable, often involve complex judgments about future events. Management is often unable to estimate the loss or a range of loss, particularly where (i) the damages sought are indeterminate, (ii) the proceedings are in the early stages, or (iii)
	there is a lack of clear or consistent interpretation of laws specific to the industry-specific complaints among different jurisdictions. In such cases, there is considerable uncertainty regarding the timing or ultimate resolution of such matters,

	Relevant PRC statutory laws and regulations permit payments of dividends by the Company&#146;s PRC subsidiaries, VIE and

	after-tax profit to general reserve fund or statutory surplus fund. As a result of these PRC laws and regulations, the Company&#146;s PRC subsidiary, VIE and VIE&#146;s subsidiaries are restricted in their abilities to transfer net assets to the
	Company in the form of dividends, loans or advances. Total restricted net assets of the Company&#146;s PRC subsidiary, VIE and VIE&#146;s subsidiaries were US$89,644 or 17.4% of the Company&#146;s total consolidated net assets as of
	December&nbsp;31, 2015. Even though the Company currently does not require any such dividends, loans or advances from the PRC subsidiaries, VIE and VIE&#146;s subsidiaries for working capital and other funding purposes, the Company may in the future
	require additional cash resources from its PRC subsidiaries and VIEs due to changes in business conditions, to fund future acquisitions and developments, or merely declare and pay dividends to or distributions to the Company&#146;s shareholders.
