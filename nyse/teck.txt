EXPLANATORY NOTE
</SPAN>
</DIV>
<P>
This Amendment No. 1 (this &quot;Amendment&quot;) to the Annual Report on Form 40-F filed
on March 31, 2005 (the &quot;Original Filing&quot;) of Teck Cominco Limited (the
&quot;Company&quot;) for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2004, is being filed for the
purpose of amending the Annual Information Form (the &quot;AIF&quot;) of the Company for
the year ended December 31, 2004. Specifically, the changes correct immaterial
differences between the AIF publicly filed by the Company with the Canadian
Securities Administrators on March 31, 2005.
</P>
<DIV>
In addition, in connection with the filing of this Amendment, we are including
as exhibits certain currently dated certifications of our Chief Executive
Officer and Chief Financial Officer. This Amendment has no effect on the Audited
Consolidated Financial Statements of the Company, Management's Discussion and
Analysis of Financial Position and Operating Results or other information
presented in the Original Filing. Therefore, this Amendment should be read
together with other documents that the Company has filed with the Securities and
Exchange Commission subsequent to the filing of the Original Filing. Information
in such reports and documents updates and supersedes certain information
contained in this Amendment. The filing of this Amendment shall not be deemed an
admission that the Original Filing , when made, included any known, untrue
statement of material fact or knowingly omitted to state a material fact
necessary to make a statement not misleading.

CAUTIONARY STATEMENT ON FORWARD-LOOKING INFORMATION
</SPAN>
</P>
<P>
This Annual Information Form and the material  incorporated by reference therein
contain  certain  forward-looking  statements  within the  meaning of the United
States Private Securities  Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These  forward-looking
statements  include  estimates,  forecasts,  and  statements as to  management's
expectations  with respect to, among other  things,  the size and quality of our
mineral reserves and mineral resources, future trends for our business, progress
in development of our mineral  properties,  future production,  capital and mine
production   costs,   estimates  of  reclamation  and  other  costs  related  to
environmental  protection,  demand and market  outlook for  commodities,  future
commodity  prices and  treatment  and  refining  charges,  the  outcome of legal
proceedings we are involved in, and our financial results. These forward-looking
statements  involve numerous  assumptions,  risks and  uncertainties  and actual
results may vary.
</P>
<P>
Factors that may cause actual  results to vary include,  but are not limited to,
acquisitions or  divestitures of assets,  changes in commodity and power prices,
changes in interest and currency  exchange rates,  changes in  environmental  or
other  regulations  or  the  interpretation  of  those  regulations,  inaccurate
geological and  metallurgical  assumptions  (including with respect to the size,
grade and  recoverability  of mineral  reserves  and  resources),  unanticipated
operational  difficulties (including failure of plant, equipment or processes to
operate in accordance with  specifications  or  expectations,  cost  escalation,
unavailability  of materials and equipment,  government  action or delays in the
receipt of  government  approvals,  disputes  with  business  partners  or joint
venturers,  industrial  disturbances or other job action, changes in our ability
to secure adequate  transportation  for our products,  and unanticipated  events
related to health,  safety and  environmental  matters),  political risk, social
unrest,  and  changes  in  general  economic  conditions  or  conditions  in the
financial markets.
</P>
<P>
Statements  relating to estimates of reserves and resources are  forward-looking
statements,  as they involve risks and assumptions (including but not limited to
assumptions with respect to future  commodity  prices and production  economics)
that the reserves and resources  described  exist in the  quantities  and grades
estimated, and are capable of economic extraction.
</P>
<P>
We do not  assume  the  obligation  to revise or  update  these  forward-looking
statements after the date of this Annual  Information Form, or to revise them to
reflect the occurrence of future unanticipated events, except as may be required
under applicable securities laws.

<P>
Teck Cominco  Limited,  previously  Teck  Corporation,  was continued  under the
Canada Business Corporations Act in 1978. It is the continuing company resulting
from the merger in 1963 of the  interests  of The  Teck-Hughes  Gold Mines Ltd.,
Lamaque  Gold Mines  Limited and Canadian  Devonian  Petroleum  Ltd.,  companies
incorporated in 1913, 1937 and 1951 respectively.  Over the years, several other
reorganizations  have been  undertaken.  These  include our merger with  Brameda
Resources  Limited and The Yukon  Consolidated  Gold  Corporation  in 1979,  the
merger with  Highmont  Mining  Corporation  and Iso Mines  Limited in 1979,  the
consolidation  with Afton Mines Ltd.  in 1981 and the merger  with  Copperfields
Mining Corporation in 1983. On July 20, 2001, we completed a merger with Cominco
Ltd. by acquiring  all of the issued and  outstanding  share  capital of Cominco
Ltd. that we did not previously  own by way of a plan of  arrangement  under the
Canada Business  Corporations Act. Pursuant to the plan of arrangement,  Cominco
Ltd.  shareholders received 1.8 Class B subordinate voting shares of the Company
plus six dollars in cash for each  Cominco Ltd.  common share held.  On July 23,
2001, Cominco Ltd. changed its name to Teck Cominco Metals Ltd. and on September
12, 2001, we changed our name to Teck Cominco Limited.
</P>
<P>
Since 1978,  the Articles of the Company have been amended on several  occasions
to provide for various series of preferred shares and other corporate  purposes.
On January 19, 1988, our Articles were amended to provide for the subdivision of
our Class A common shares and Class B subordinate voting shares on a two-for-one
basis.  On  September  12, 2001,  the  Articles  were amended to effect the name
change described above and to convert each outstanding Class A common share into
one new Class A common share and 0.2 Class B  subordinate  voting  shares and to
enact  &quot;coattail&quot;  takeover bid  protection in favour of the Class B subordinate
voting shares.  See &quot;Description of Capital Structure&quot; at page 33 of this Annual
Information  Form for a  description  of the  attributes  of the  Class A common
shares and Class B subordinate voting shares.
</P>
<P>
On November 28, 2003 our Articles were amended to provide for the designation of
790,000  preference  shares as  &quot;Preference  Shares Series 1&quot; and by designating
550,000  preference shares as &quot;Preference  Shares Series 2.&quot; See &quot;Description of
Capital  Structure&quot; at page 33 of this Annual Information Form for a description
of the attributes of the Series 1 and Series 2 preferred shares.

2002
</P>
<P>
Our  earnings in 2002 were  severely  affected  by lower  prices for many of our
principal  products.  Electrical  power  prices  were  unusually  high in  2001,
averaging  US$174 per MW.h.,  but declined to US$23 per MW.h. in 2002.  Zinc and
copper  prices  averaged  US$0.35 and US$0.71  per pound  respectively  in 2002,
compared with US$0.40 and US$0.73 per pound in 2001.  Partially  offsetting  the
effects of low zinc and copper  prices were higher gold prices,  which  averaged
US$314 per ounce  compared with US$282 per ounce in 2001, and higher coal prices
which at an average price of US$44 per tonne were 10% higher than in 2001.

<P>
Lower zinc prices  contributed  to an operating loss of $36 million for the year
at Red Dog  compared  to an  operating  profit of $4 million in the prior  year.
Operating  profit from gold operations  declined from $35 million to $20 million
during the year due to reduced production as a result of ground control problems
and the November 2001 sale of the Company's  interest in PacMin,  despite higher
gold prices during the year.  Operating  profit from coal  operations  increased
from $87  million in 2001 to $112  million in 2002 as a result of higher  prices
with similar sales volumes.
</P>
<P>
Major  investments  included  completion of the funding of the Antamina  project
($26 million), ongoing construction of the Pend Oreille mine in Washington State
($33 million),  and upgrades to power  generation  assets at the Waneta Dam ($35
million). The latter two projects continued into 2003.
</P>
<P>
2003
</P>
<P>
Realized  zinc  and  copper  prices  averaged  US$0.38  and  US$0.85  per  pound
respectively  compared  with US$0.35 and US$0.71 per pound in 2002.  Gold prices
continued to increase during the year, with an average  realized price of US$359
per ounce, up from US$314 per ounce in 2002.  Partially offsetting the effect of
higher metal prices were lower coal prices,  which  declined  from an average of
US$44 per tonne to US$43 per tonne in 2003 and a weaker U.S. dollar.
</P>
<P>
On February 28, 2003, we completed a transaction with Fording Inc.  (&quot;Fording&quot;),
Westshore  Terminals  Income Fund,  Sherritt  International  Corporation and the
Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan Board to combine the metallurgical coal assets of
Fording,  Luscar  Energy  Partnership  and Teck  Cominco in the Elk Valley  Coal
Partnership  ( &quot;Elk Valley  Coal&quot;).  We  contributed  our Elkview  mine and $125
million in cash to obtain an initial 35% interest in Elk Valley Coal.  Under the
agreement  between  the  Company,   Fording,   Quintette  Coal  Partnership  and
Teck-Bullmoose Inc. providing for the formation and operation of Elk Valley Coal
(the &quot;Partnership Agreement&quot;), our interest could be increased to 40% should Elk
Valley Coal attain  certain  synergies  and realize  certain cash flows from the
Elkview mine during the four year period ended March 31, 2007. See  &quot;Significant
Acquisitions  and  Dispositions&quot;  below.  We also paid $150  million  for a 9.1%
interest  in  the  Fording   Canadian  Coal  Trust   (&quot;FCCT&quot;),   formed  by  the
reorganization  of Fording into an income trust.  FCCT owns the remainder of Elk
Valley Coal and certain other assets.
</P>
<P>
In April 2003, the Bullmoose metallurgical coal mine closed after exhausting its
coal reserves following twenty years of operation.
</P>
<P>
We had provided the lenders of senior debt financing of the Antamina mine with a
guarantee  of its 22.5%  share of project  debt.  Effective  July 1,  2003,  the
project debt became non recourse to the project sponsors when certain completion
tests  were  met.   Completion   resulted  in  the  removal  of  certain  voting
restrictions  imposed on the Company in relation to the  management of Antamina.
Consequently, we began to proportionately consolidate our investment in Antamina
effective July 1, 2003.
</P>
<P>
In October  2003,  we sold our interest in the Los Filos gold property in Mexico
for US$48.4 million in cash.

In November  2003, we completed our  acquisition of the Lennard Shelf zinc mines
in the Kimberley  region of Western  Australia for AUS$26 million plus taxes and
transaction  costs.  We  subsequently  agreed to sell a 50%  interest in Lennard
Shelf to Noranda Inc.  Noranda can earn its interest by matching our  investment
in Lennard Shelf. The Lennard Shelf mines were placed on care and maintenance by
the vendor  prior to our  acquisition.  Studies are  underway to  determine  the
feasibility  of reopening  the Lennard  Shelf  mines.  A decision to restart the
mines will  depend on the  outcome of this  program,  as well as on zinc  market
conditions and exchange rates.
</P>
<P>
2004
</P>
<P>
Realized prices for our principal products increased  substantially during 2004,
following  changes in market conditions which commenced in the fourth quarter of
2003.  Realized  zinc and copper prices  averaged  US$0.48 and US$1.35 per pound
respectively  compared  with  US$0.38 and US$0.85 in 2003.  Realized  molybdenum
prices increased to an average of US$19 per pound in 2004 from US$5 per pound in
2003. At the end of the year, the molybdenum price was US$30.00 per pound.  Coal
prices  also  increased  from US$45 per tonne to US$52 per tonne in 2004.  These
price  increases  were somewhat  offset by a weaker U.S.  dollar.  Higher prices
dramatically improved earnings and cash flows at all of our major operations.
</P>
<P>
In March 2004,  we completed the purchase of an  additional  33.57%  interest in
HVC. The additional interest contributed $75 million to earnings during 2004. We
began studies at the Highland Valley Copper mine to determine the feasibility of
extending  the life of the mine by four years to 2013.  A final  decision on the
extension is expected to be taken in 2006, after geotechnical  studies have been
completed.
</P>
<P>
Pursuant to the Partnership Agreement governing Elk Valley Coal, our interest in
Elk Valley Coal was increased to 38% effective  April 1, 2004 (see  &quot;Significant
Acquisitions and Dispositions&quot; below).
</P>
<P>
In December  2004,  we completed  the sale of our interest in the  Cajamarquilla
refinery (see &quot;Significant Acquisitions and Dispositions&quot; below).
</P>
<P>
In May 2004,  following the  withdrawal of an appeal in relation to the issuance
of a key environmental  permit, site construction began at the Pogo gold project
in Alaska.  Elk Valley Coal also commenced the  development of the Cheviot Creek
pit at the Cardinal River mine.
</P>
<P>
As a result of the record  earnings and operating cash flow in 2004, we finished
the year with cash balances of over $900 million against  long-term debt of $627
million.  In November 2004, we announced that we were increasing the semi-annual
dividend  payable to  shareholders  of record on December 31, 2004 from $0.10 to
$0.20,  bringing  the total  annual  dividend  for 2004 to $0.30 per share.  Our
dividend policy  contemplates the payment of two semi-annual  dividends at $0.20
per share in 2005.
</P>
<P>
Coal and copper  production  in 2005 are  expected  to  increase  by 17% and 10%
respectively,  while  molybdenum  production  is  expected  to  decrease  by 38%
compared with 2004.
</P>
<P>
Our metal sales are priced at  prevailing  market  prices.  The  majority of our
metallurgical coal sales are sold at negotiated  contract prices.  Substantially
all of the hard  coking  coal sales for the coal year  commencing  April 1, 2005
have been  contracted  at an average  price of US$125 per tonne,  a  significant
increase from the average of US$52 per tonne in the 2004/2005 coal year.

On March 2, 2004 we completed the  acquisition,  through the exercise of a right

<P>
The Partnership  Agreement  establishing  Elk Valley Coal provided that we could
increase our interest in Elk Valley Coal by up to 5% from an initial 35%, to the
extent that operating  synergies  realized by Elk Valley Coal and  distributable
cash  generated  by  the  Elkview  mine  (collectively,  &quot;Incremental  Returns&quot;)
exceeded  certain  cumulative  targets during the four year period from April 1,
2003 to March 31, 2007. An independent  engineering  firm was retained to assist
in the determination of Incremental Returns. Following receipt of the opinion of
the independent engineer, the Company and Fording reached agreement in July 2004
on the  amount of  Incremental  Returns  and the  resulting  adjustments  to our
interest in Elk Valley  Coal.  Our  initial 35%  interest  was  increased  by 3%
effective  April 1, 2004,  and will be increased by an additional 1% on April 1,
2005 and on April 1, 2006, bringing our total direct interest in Elk Valley Coal

proceeds of $168 million after repayment of debt related to Cajamarquilla of $56
million.  Under the  agreement of purchase and sale,  we are entitled to receive
additional  price-linked  payments of approximately  US$365,000 for each US$0.01
that the average annual price of zinc exceeds  US$0.454 per pound in each of the
years from 2005 to 2009  inclusive.  In  addition,  if the  purchaser  elects to
expand the  refinery  during the first three years  following  the sale,  we are
entitled to an additional  payment of US$12.75 million in year one, declining to
US$4.25 million in year three.

Our  principal  markets for refined  zinc are,  in order of  importance,  United
States,  Asia and  Europe.  Refined  zinc  produced at Trail is  distributed  to
customers  in the United  States by rail and/or truck and to customers in Europe
and Asia by ship.
</P>
<P>
. All of our revenues  from sales of refined zinc and zinc  concentrates  (other
than Red Dog zinc concentrates treated at Trail) are derived from sales to third
parties. Zinc concentrates and refined zinc are fungible commodities.  We strive
to  differentiate  our products by producing the sizes and shapes best suited to
our major customers' needs.
</P>
<P>
All of the zinc  concentrates  produced by our Pend Oreille  mine in  Washington
State are shipped by truck to the Trail metallurgical operations. Trail's supply
of zinc and lead  concentrates  other than those  sourced  from our own mines is
provided  through  long-term  and spot  contracts  with mine  producers in North
America and South America.
</P>
<P>
We have substantial  long-term frame contracts for the sale of zinc concentrates
from the Red Dog mine to customers in Asia (Korea Zinc) and Europe (Glencore and
Xstrata).

Metallurgical Coal
</SPAN>
</P>
<P>
Our principal markets for metallurgical coal are the hard coking coal markets in
Asia and Europe.  Processed coal is shipped by rail to the Westshore and Neptune
Terminals in the lower mainland of British Columbia or directly by rail to North
American customers or by rail and barge through Thunder Bay Terminals in Thunder
Bay, Ontario.  Rail service to the five Elk Valley mines is provided by Canadian
Pacific Railway (see &quot;Coal  Transportation  and Sales&quot;, on page 12 for a summary
of a recent dispute with respect to this contract).
</P>
<P>
All of Elk Valley Coal's production is fully contracted for the remainder of the
2004  coal  year and all of the 2005 coal  year,  with more than 95% of  volumes
contracted under evergreen or long-term agreements.
</P>
<P>
Elk Valley Coal competes  primarily  with  producers in Australia and the United
States. The supply of coal in global markets and the demand for hard coking coal
among world steel producers has historically provided for a competitive seaborne
market. Coal pricing is generally  established in US dollars and the competitive
positioning among producers can be significantly affected by exchange rates. The
competitive  position of Elk Valley Coal continues to be determined primarily by
the  quality of its  various  coal  products  and its  reputation  as a reliable
supplier,  as well as by its  production  and  transportation  costs compared to
other producers throughout the world.
</P>
<P>
The seaborne hard coking coal markets are cyclical in nature. Over-supply in the
years  1997 - 2000 and the  economic  downturn  in a number  of Asian  countries
caused  prices  to drop by more than 30%.  Demand  strengthened  in 2003 and has
remained strong through 2004 and 2005. Integrated steel mills and coke producers
around the world are finding it difficult  to secure  sufficient  quantities  of
hard coking coal. In addition, steel production in China is forecast to increase
in the next few  years,  which  could  result  in  increased  demand.  Sales and
production for the 2005 coal year are expected to be at or near capacity.
</P>
<P>
<SPAN STYLE="font-weight: bold">
Copper Concentrates
</SPAN>
</P>
<P>
Our  principal  market  for copper  concentrates  is Asia.  Copper  concentrates
produced at Highland  Valley Copper are distributed to customers in Asia by rail
to a storage facility in Vancouver,  British Columbia, and from there by ship to
customers in Asia. Copper concentrates produced at Antamina are transported by a
slurry  pipeline to a port at Huarmey,  Peru and from there by ship to customers
in Europe and Asia.
</P>
<P>
The copper  concentrate  business is cyclical.  Treatment  charges rise and fall
depending  upon the supply of copper  concentrates  in the market and the demand
for custom copper concentrates by the copper smelting and refining industry.  In
2003,  treatment  charges  fell in  response  to a  shortage  of  custom  copper
concentrates due to reduced mine production and increased  smelting and refining
capacity  in Asia.  As the  price of copper  rose  through  2003 and 2004,  mine
production  increased and treatment charges returned to more normal levels.  The
price of copper  fluctuates with the  comparative  supply and demand for refined
copper.  Increased demand for refined copper in China has, in large part, driven
the relatively high price of refined copper in the last two years.

Red Dog Mine, United States (Zinc, Lead)
</SPAN>
</P>
<P>
The Red Dog zinc-lead mine,  concentrator and shipping facility in the Northwest
Arctic Borough near Kotzebue,  Alaska, commenced production in December 1989 and
began  shipping  concentrates  in July 1990.  The Red Dog mine is 100% owned and
operated by Teck Cominco Alaska Incorporated,  subject to a royalty as described
below.
</P>
<P>
The mining method employed is conventional  drill and blast open pit mining. The
main  pit has an  expected  life of 7 years  at  current  rates  of  production.
Additional  reserves  have been  identified  in the  vicinity of the  processing
facilities  sufficient to extend the life of the operation by a further 16 years
for a total mine life of 23 years.  The  mineral  processing  facilities  employ
conventional  grinding and sulphide  flotation  methods to produce zinc and lead
concentrates.
</P>
<P>
The mine and  concentrator  properties are leased from, and are being  developed
under the terms of a development and operating agreement with, the NANA Regional
Corporation,  Inc.  (&quot;NANA&quot;),  a native Alaskan  development  corporation.  NANA
receives an annual advance  royalty equal to the greater of 4.5% of the value of
annual  production  or US$1 million until our business has recovered its capital
investment,  interest and the advance  royalties  previously paid to NANA. After
those amounts have been recovered  NANA will have a carried  interest in the net
proceeds of production  from the mine,  starting at 25% and increasing to 50% by
successive increments of 5% at five-year intervals. In addition to the royalties
payable to NANA, the operation is subject to State and federal income taxes.
</P>
<P>
All  contaminated  water  from the mine area and waste  dumps is  collected  and
contained in a tailings  impoundment and seasonally  discharged  through a water
treatment  plant.  Mill process water is reclaimed  from the tailings  pond. The
mine and an associated  port facility  operate under effluent  permits issued by
the United States Environmental  Protection Agency and air permits issued by the
State of Alaska. The operation is in material compliance with all of its permits
or related  regulatory  instruments and has obtained all of the permits that are
material to its operations. Permit renewal applications are underway. Additional
permits will be required for future development at Red Dog.
</P>
<P>
In addition  to the  original  capital  invested to  establish  mining,  mineral
processing and transportation infrastructure, substantial additional capital has
been invested at Red Dog to increase  production and optimize mineral processing
and transportation facilities.
</P>
<P>
A project to optimize the mill and increase  production  from 900,000  tonnes of
zinc  concentrate per year to 1,100,000 tonnes per year was completed at the end
of 2001.  This  project  also  improved  the  grade of the  concentrate  and the
recovery of zinc in 2002.
</P>
<P>
Red Dog is  comprised  of a number  of  sedimentary  hosted  exhalative  (SEDEX)
lead-zinc  sulfide  deposits hosted in  Mississippian-age  to  Pennsylvanian-age
sedimentary  rocks. The orebodies are lens shaped and occur within  structurally
controlled  (thrust faults) plates,  are relatively flat lying and are hosted by
marine  clastic  rocks  (shales,  siltstones,  turbidites)  and lesser chert and
carbonate  rocks.  Barite  rock  is  common  in and  above  the  sulfide  units.
Silicification is the dominant alteration type.

The sulfide  mineralization  consists  of  semi-massive  to massive  sphalerite,
pyrite,  marcasite and galena.  Common  textures within the sulfide zone include
massive, fragmental, veined and rarely sedimentary layering.
</P>
<P>
Approximately 25% of the zinc concentrate  produced at Red Dog is shipped to our
metallurgical facilities at Trail, British Columbia and the balance to customers
in Asia and Europe.  The lead concentrate  production is shipped to customers in
Asia and Europe.  The  majority of  concentrate  sales are pursuant to long-term
contracts at market prices subject to annually negotiated treatment and refining
charges.  The balance is sold on the spot market at prices  based on  prevailing
market  quotations.  Because the  shipping  season at Red Dog is  restricted  to
approximately  100 days per year because of sea ice conditions,  Red Dog's sales
are  seasonal  with the  majority of sales in the last five months of each year.
Concentrate is stockpiled at the port facility and is typically  shipped between
July and October.

Pend Oreille Mine, United States (Zinc, Lead)
</SPAN>
</P>
<P>
Construction  was  completed  at the Pend Oreille  mine,  near  Metaline  Falls,
Washington,  in early 2004 at a total cost of US$74  million  and the mine is in
commercial production.  We own 100% of the Pend Oreille mine. A probable reserve
of 5.7 million  tonnes  grading 7.7% zinc and 1.4% lead is expected to provide a
mine life of 8 years with some potential for  extension.  Inferred and indicated
resources of 3.3 million  tonnes  grading 6.6% zinc and 1.3% lead  identified on
the main  Washington  Rock  zone and in a  separate  zone to the  north  require
further drilling and evaluation to qualify as reserves.  Several significant new
drill  targets  have  been  identified  in the  immediate  area  using  downhole
geophysical techniques.
</P>
<P>
Pend Oreille  holds all permits  necessary  for its operation and is in material
compliance  with  these  permits.  Certain  provisions  of the  mine's  National
Pollutant Discharge  Elimination System permit are the subject of an appeal. The
appeal is not expected to affect operations at the mine.
</P>
<P>
The Pend Oreille mine is a carbonate  hosted  zinc-lead ore body situated within
the Metaline  Formation in the southern portion of the Kootenay arc, an arcuate,
narrow  belt  of  sedimentary,   volcanic  and  metamorphic   rocks   separating
Precambrian  metasediments  to the east and Mesozoic  volcanic  and  sedimentary
units to the west.  Metaline carbonates host the known zinc-lead deposits within
the district.
</P>
<P>
Mineralization at the Pend Oreille mine is located within the Yellowhead horizon
of the Metaline Formation,  an intensely altered stratabound  dolomitic solution
breccia,  which has been invaded and replaced by fine grained pyrite with lesser
Zn  and  Pb  sulfides.  The  sulfide  zone  has  relatively  simple  mineralogy.
Sphalerite  and Galena are the two ore  minerals of  interest.  Gangue  minerals
include pyrite, dolomite and calcite.
</P>
<P>
The Pend Oreille mine is an underground mine. The mineral processing  facilities
employ  conventional  grinding  and sulphide  flotation  methods to produce high
quality zinc and lead concentrates.  Annual production is forecast to be 730,000
tonnes per year of ore to produce 83,000 tonnes per year of zinc concentrate and
13,000 tonnes per year of lead concentrate. The concentrates are hauled by truck
to Trail Metallurgical Operations.

Teck  Cominco  Metals owns and  operates  the  integrated  smelting and refining
complex at Trail,  British Columbia.  The complex's  principal  products include
refined zinc, lead,  silver and gold.  Germanium  dioxide,  indium,  cadmium and
copper compounds are also produced as metal co-products, along with a variety of
sulphur products and ammonium sulphate fertilizers.
</P>
<P>
Trail's  zinc  operations  consist  of  six  major  metallurgical   plants,  one
fertilizer  plant and two  specialty  metal  plants.  The facility has an annual
capacity of approximately  295,000 tonnes of refined zinc. Zinc concentrates are
initially treated in roasters or pressure leach  facilities.  The zinc and other
elements are put into  solutionbefore  the zinc is purified and electroplated in
an  electrolytic  refining  plant onto  cathodes.  Refined  zinc is  produced by
remelting  the zinc  cathodes  and then  casting the zinc into  various  shapes,
grades and alloys to meet customer requirements.  The specialty metals processes
extract co-products to produce valuable metals. Construction of the lead smelter
modernization project, including the KIVCET furnace and a slag fuming plant, was
completed and the plants were started up in 1997.  Lead  concentrates,  recycled
batteries,   residues  from  the  zinc  circuits  and  various  other  lead  and
silver-bearing  materials  are treated in the KIVCET  flash  furnace and refined
into lead in the cell electro-refinery.  Silver and gold are also recovered from
this circuit after further processing.
</P>
<P>
Drainage water from the smelter site and metallurgical  effluent is collected in
ponds and treated through a water treatment  plant.  The smelter  operates under
effluent and air emission  permits  issued by the British  Columbia  Ministry of
Water, Land and Air Protection. The operation is in material compliance with all
of its permits and has  obtained  all of the  permits  that are  material to its
operations.
</P>
<P>
Teck Cominco Metals also owns the Waneta  hydroelectric  power plant near Trail.
It has an installed  capacity of 450 megawatts and an annual  average  output of
approximately 2,700 gigawatt hours of energy.  Included in the above numbers are
the capacity  increases  completed in 2003.  The second and third  turbines were
upgraded  resulting in 50 MW more capacity and  approximately 135 gigawatt hours
per annum more energy  available for sale. This plant,  together with agreements
with  B.C.  Hydro  and  Fortis  Inc.,  provides  electric  power  to  the  Trail
metallurgical  operation. The operation of various other hydroelectric plants in
the watershed is coordinated  through  contractual  arrangements with B.C. Hydro
and other related  parties under which we receive 2,690  gigawatt hours per year
of energy even during low water years.  We also own a 15 kilometre  transmission
line from Waneta to the United States' power distribution  system. Power that is
surplus to our needs at Trail is sold in Canada and in the United States.

in west central Alberta.  All of Elk Valley Coal's mines are open pit operations
and are  designed to operate on a continuous  basis,  24 hours per day, 365 days
per year. Operating schedules can be varied depending on market conditions.  All
of the mines are accessed by two lane all-weather  roads which connect to public
highways.  All the mines operate under permits granted by Provincial and Federal
regulatory authorities. Provincial remediation reclamation permits are placed to
permit all facets of the mining process. From time to time each of the mines may
require  additional  permits in respect of the location of additional  dumps and
tailings  impoundment areas that will be required as mining operations  proceed.
All permits necessary for the current operations of the mines are in hand and in

In British  Columbia,  coal  licenses are issued for one-year  terms and have an
initial cost of $7 per hectare, increasing by $5 per hectare every five years to
a maximum of $30 per  hectare.  Elk Valley  Coal  currently  pays  license  fees
ranging  from $7 to $30 per  hectare.  Coal leases are granted for periods of 30
years and have an annual cost of $10 per hectare.  In Alberta,  Crown leases are
granted by the  provincial  government  and are  generally  issued for 15 years.
Annual lease rentals are approximately $4 per hectare.  In the past, renewals of
these licences and leases have  generally been granted  although there can be no
assurance that this will continue in the future.
</P>
<P>
Five of Elk Valley  Coal's six coal mines  operate in British  Columbia  and are
therefore subject to mineral taxes. British Columbia mineral tax is a 2-tier tax
with a minimum rate of 2% and a maximum rate of 13%. A minimum tax of 2% applies
to operating cash flows,  as defined by the  regulations.  A maximum tax rate of
13%  applies  to cash  flows  after  taking  available  deductions  for  capital
expenditures and other permitted deductions.
</P>
<P>
Elk Valley Coal's mines employ conventional  open-pit mining techniques and coal
preparation  plants.  Following  mining,  the coal is washed  using a variety of
conventional techniques and conveyed to coal-fired dryers for drying.  Processed
coal is conveyed to clean coal silos or other storage facilities for storage and
load-out to railcars.

Elk Valley Coal and CPR are in a dispute  concerning the manner in which freight
rates  for coal  shipped  to west  coast  ports  from  the  five  mines is to be
determined.  Legal proceedings in relation to the dispute have been initiated by
CPR in the Alberta Court of Queen's Bench and by Elk Valley Coal  Corporation in
a final  offer  arbitration  under the  Canadian  Transportation  Act (&quot;CTA&quot;) in
respect of the Elkview Mine. On December 13, 2004, an arbitrator  accepted CPR's
final offer in the  arbitration,  which could  determine the rate payable by Elk
Valley Coal for coal shipped from the Elkview Mine to the west coast ports.  The
arbitrated rate is confidential and cannot be disclosed.  However,  CPR has also
challenged the Canadian  Transportation  Agency's  jurisdiction under the CTA to
refer the determination of freight rates for the Elkview Mine to the arbitrator.
If that  challenge  is  successful,  it  would  supersede  the  decision  of the
arbitrator. If CPR's jurisdictional challenge is not successful,  the arbitrated
rate for the  Elkview  Mine may  apply to some or all of the other  four  mines,
depending on the outcome of the Alberta Court of Queen's Bench action.
</P>
<P>
Regardless of the outcome of the proceedings, rail rates for westbound coal will
increase and such increase is likely to be material.  An unfavourable outcome of
one or both of the legal  proceedings will also result in a material increase in
rail rates charged to Elk Valley Coal for westbound coal.
</P>
<P>
In  January  2005,  Elk Valley  Coal and CPR agreed to engage in a  confidential
mediation/negotiation process to attempt to resolve the dispute and that process
is ongoing.  CPR has stated that the dispute is not expected to adversely affect
the shipment of coal from the Elk Valley mines.
</P>
<P>
Rail service provided by CPR to eastern  destinations  from the Elk Valley Mines
is not the subject of either legal proceeding.

Antamina Mine, Peru (Copper, Zinc)
</SPAN>
</P>
<P>
In July 1998 we acquired 25% of the Antamina copper,  zinc project in Peru, with
the  balance  then held by BHP  Billiton,  through Rio Algom,  and Noranda  Inc.
(&quot;Noranda&quot;).  Subsequently,  in October 1999, Mitsubishi  Corporation acquired a
10%  interest in the  Antamina  project,  resulting  in a reduction of the other
participants' interests to 33.75% for each of BHP Billiton and Noranda and 22.5%
for us. The participants' interests are represented by shares of Compania Minera
Antamina S.A. (&quot;CMA&quot;),  the Peruvian company that owns and operates the project.
Our interest is subject to a net profits royalty of 1.667% on the project's free
cash flow after  recovery  of  capital  costs and an  interest  factor on 60% of
project expenditures.
</P>
<P>
The Antamina project property consists of numerous mining concessions and mining
claims  (including  surface  rights)  covering an area of  approximately  14,000
hectares.  CMA also owns a port  facility  located at Huarmey and an  electrical
substation located at Huallanca.  In addition,  CMA holds title to all easements
and rights of way for the 302  kilometer  concentrate  pipeline from the mine to
CMA's port at Huarmey.
</P>
<P>
Project  financing was arranged in the amount of US$1.32 billion of senior loans
with a consortium of 20 banks and export/import credit agencies.  The balance of
required funding was arranged pro rata by the CMA shareholders.
</P>
<P>
Our share of the project cost to completion was approximately US$490 million, of
which US$300 million was provided by the project  financing.  Total  development
cost was  US$2.206  billion.  In July 2003,  CMA achieved  completion  under the
project finance  documentation  and the project debt became  non-recourse to the
CMA project sponsors, including Teck Cominco.
</P>
<P>
The deposit is located at an average  elevation of 4,200 meters,  385 kilometers
by road and 270  kilometers  by air north of Lima,  Peru.  Antamina  lies on the
eastern  side of the  Western  Cordillera  in the upper part of the Rio  Maranon
basin, a tributary of the Amazon River.
</P>
<P>
The open pit is a truck/shovel  operation.  The ore is crushed at the rim of the
pit and conveyed through a 2.7 kilometer tunnel to a coarse ore stockpile at the
<BR>
mill. It is then processed utilizing a SAG mill, followed by ball mill, grinding
and flotation to produce  separate  copper,  zinc,  molybdenum and  lead/bismuth
concentrates. A 302 kilometer long slurry concentrate pipeline,  approximately 9
inch diameter,  with a single pump station at the minesite transports copper and
zinc  concentrates  to the port where  they are  dewatered  and stored  prior to
loading onto vessels for shipment to refineries and smelters world-wide.
</P>
<P>
Power  for the mine is taken  from the Peru  national  energy  grid  through  an
electrical substation  constructed at Huallanca.  Water requirements are sourced
from a dam-created  reservoir upstream from the tailings  impoundment  facility.
The  tailings  impoundment  facility is located next to the mill and waste dumps
are located  adjacent to the pit. Fresh water from mill  operations is collected
and contained in a tailings  impoundment  area.  Mill process water is reclaimed
from the tailings pond. The operation is subject to water and air permits issued
by the Government of Peru and is in material compliance with those permits.  The
operation holds all of the permits that are material to its operations

Ore is mined from two sources,  the Lornex and Valley mines. Both are located in
the Guichon Batholith which hosts all of the ore bodies located in the area. The
Lornex ore body occurs in Skeena Quartz  Diorite host rock,  intruded by younger
pre-mineral  Quartz  Porphyry and Aplite Dykes.  The Skeena Quartz Diorite is an
intermediate  phase of the Guichon Batholith and is generally a medium to coarse
grained  equigranular  rock  distinguished  by interstitial  quartz and moderate
ferromagnesian  minerals.  The sulphide ore is  primarily  fracture  fillings of
chalcopyrite,  bornite and molybdenite with minor pyrite, magnetite,  sphalerite
and galena.
</P>
<P>
The host rocks of the Valley deposit are mainly  porphyritic  quartz  monzonites
and  granodiorites  of the  Bethsaida  phase of the  Batholith.  These rocks are
medium to coarse-grained with large phenocrysts of quartz and biotite. The rocks
of the deposit were subjected to hydrothermal  alteration  followed by extensive
quartz  veining,   quartz-sericite   veining,   and   silicification.   Bornite,
chalcopyrite and molybdenum were introduced with the quartz and  quartz-sericite
veins and typically fill angular openings in them. Accessory minerals consist of
hornblende,   magnetite,  hematite,  sphene,  apatite  and  zircon.  Pre-mineral
porphyry and aplite dykes intrude the host rocks of the deposit.
</P>
<P>
In January 2004, HVC entered into a new three year collective agreement with the
United Steelworkers of America.
</P>
<P>
At current  rates of  production  the  operation  has an expected  life of 4 1/2
years.  In 2004 we began studies to assess the feasibility of extending the mine
life to 2013.  A  decision  to proceed  with the  extension  will  depend on the

Hemlo Gold Operations, Canada (Gold)
</SPAN>
</P>
<P>
We have a 50% joint  venture  interest  in two gold mines in the Hemlo Gold Camp
located  near  Marathon,  Ontario:  the  Williams and David Bell gold mines (the
&quot;Hemlo Operations&quot;). Homestake Canada Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Barrick
Gold Corporation (&quot;Homestake&quot;),  holds the remaining 50% joint venture interest.
Our share of  production  is subject to a 2.25% net  smelter  return  royalty at
Williams and a 3% net smelter return royalty at David Bell.
</P>
<P>
The Hemlo  Operations  lie  adjacent  to the  Trans-Canada  Highway in the Hemlo
district of Ontario,  and operate  throughout  the year. The mill located at the
Williams mine  processes ore for both the Williams mine and the David Bell mine.
Power for the Hemlo Operations is taken from the Ontario Hydro grid, and back-up
standby  diesel  generators  are available at the site to provide some emergency
support  should the grid not be able to supply  power.  Water  requirements  are
sourced from Cedar Creek and personnel from both mines live in nearby areas, the
majority in Marathon, Ontario.
</P>
<P>
The Hemlo Operations  operate a combined tailings  management system including a
tailings  basin and polishing  pond.  The property  includes one tailings  pond,
located  approximately  four  kilometers  from the Williams mill, and four waste
stockpiles  located  adjacent to the Williams  open pit.  The Williams  effluent
treatment plant employs polishing pond water as feed water and the Williams mill
reclaims  water from both the tailings  basin and the polishing  pond. The David
Bell mine  reclaims  mine water for use in the backfill  process  along with raw
water from Cedar Creek. Both operations comply with certificates of approval for
industrial  wastewater  and  air,  which  are  administered  by  the  provincial
regulatory authorities.  The Williams mill and both mines hold all the necessary
permits and certificates that are material to the operations.
</P>
<P>
The  Hemlo  Operations  are  located  in  a  small  east-west  trending  Archean
Greenstone Belt in central Ontario known as the Hemlo zone. The Williams mine is
located at the western end of the Hemlo zone,  the David Bell mine is located at
the eastern end of the Hemlo zone, and Newmont Mining Corporation's Golden Giant
mine is located  between the Williams and David Bell mines along the Hemlo zone.
The total length of the mineralized zone comprising the Williams, David Bell and
Golden Giant mines is over three kilometers.

The  Williams  and David Bell ore bodies lie at the  contact  between  overlying
metasedimentary rocks and underlying felsic metavolcanic rocks. The Williams ore
zone dips north at 60-70 degrees and the David Bell ore zone dips north at 50-60
degrees.  The ore zones continue to approximately 1,200 meters below the surface
and vary in width from 45 meters to 1 meter at Williams  and from 15 meters to 1
meter at David  Bell.  The ore at both mines is hosted by three  principal  rock
types,  feldspathised porphyry,  muscovite schist and biotite fragmental, and is
characterized  by gold,  pyrite,  molybdenite,  and barite and various  arsenic,
mercury, and antimony mineral species. Both main ore bodies are composed of fine
grained   quartz-feldspar  rock  with  gold  occurring  as  finely  disseminated
particles within the groundmass as well as with pyrite grains.

Williams Mine
</SPAN>
</P>
<P>
The Williams mine, primarily an underground operation with some open-pit mining,
has been operating since the fall of 1985. The property  comprising the Williams
mine consists of 11 patented mining claims and 6 leased claims.  The mine covers
a surface area of approximately 270 hectares.
</P>
<P>
The  Williams  mine is one of the largest  gold-producing  mines in Canada.  The
underground  mine is accessed by a 1,300 meter  production  shaft, and mining is
carried out by longhole stoping with paste backfill.  The Williams open pit mine
lies immediately  above and adjacent to the underground mine, and ore from these
two sources and the David Bell mine is treated in the  Williams  mill.  The mill
started  production in 1985 at the rate of  approximately  3,000 tonnes per day,
and capacity  was  expanded to 6,000  tonnes per day in late 1988.  The Williams
mill presently operates at the rate of approximately  10,000 tonnes per day. The
Williams mill uses  semi-autogenous  grinding and a carbon-in-pulp gold recovery
circuit. Approximately 20% of the gold is recovered by a gravity circuit. At the
present rate of mining,  the Williams  mine has an expected mine life of over 10
years.
</P>
<P CLASS="eolCenter">
<SPAN STYLE="font-weight: bold">
David Bell Mine
</SPAN>
</P>
<P>
The property  comprising  the David Bell  underground  mine  consists of granted
mining leases and mining claims,  covering a surface area of  approximately  274
hectares.
</P>
<P>
The David Bell mine was developed  through a 1,160 meter  production  shaft, and
mining is by longhole  stoping with delayed  cemented  hydraulic  backfill.  The
David Bell mill is currently on care and maintenance, and all ore from the David
Bell mine is transported  to, and processed at, the nearby Williams mill. At the
present rate of mining, the David Bell mine has an expected further mine life of
approximately 5 years.

annual rental payments.  The balance of the property is comprised of 1,281 State
mining claims,  each requiring a specified  nominal amount of annual  assessment
work.
</P>
<P>
Our 40% interest was earned by delivering a production commitment.  Our interest
is subject to  divestment  should we not  complete  construction  of the project
substantially  in  accordance  with the  feasibility  study.  We are the project
operator.
</P>
<P>
The  property is subject to a 1.5% net  smelter  return  royalty  payable by the
venturers on the first two million ounces of gold produced.  After the first two
million  ounces of gold is produced,  the 1.5% net smelter  return royalty is no
longer  payable.  However,  we (through  our indirect  wholly-owned  subsidiary,
Teck-Pogo  Inc.  (&quot;TPI&quot;)) must then pay Sumitomo  Metal Mining  America Inc. and
S.C. Minerals America Inc. a production royalty on TPI's share of any additional
ounces of gold that it takes as its share of production from the property.  This
royalty on each ounce of gold to TPI's  account is equal to the greater of 5% of
the price of gold and US$25.  We are entitled to a management fee as the project
operator.
</P>
<P>
Following receipt of the National Pollution Discharge Elimination System (NPDES)
permit  issued by the  United  States  EPA in the first  quarter  of 2004,  site
construction began.
</P>
<P>
The  project  consists  of an  underground  mine and  2,500  tonne  per day mill
expected to produce an average of 400,000 ounces of gold per year over a 10 year
mine life. The proposed  mining methods are cut and fill and drift and fill. The
mill  will  utilize   conventional   milling,  and  gravity  and  carbon-in-pulp
technology.  The gold from both the gravity and carbon-in-pulp  circuits will be
produced  as dore  bullion.  Access  to the  site is  provided  by a new 50 mile
all-season  road from the  Richardson  Highway  north of Delta  Junction  to the
property.  The project capital cost is currently estimated at US$321 million and
the mine is expected commence production by the beginning of 2006.
</P>
<P>
Surface exploration programs have been conducted on the property over the past 4
years and have identified a discontinuous  trend of mineralization  known as the
Pogo Trend. Within this trend,  several gold drill targets are defined and these
will be tested in future drilling programs.
</P>

<SPAN STYLE="font-weight: bold">
Exploration
</SPAN>
</P>
<P>
In 2004, we spent  approximately  $42 million on exploration,  and approximately
$22  million  was  spent by  third  parties  on  properties  in which we  retain
significant back-in rights.  Approximately 62% of expenditures were dedicated to
exploration for gold and copper and the balance on base metal,  polymetallic and
diamond projects.
</P>
<P>
Of total  exploration  expenditures,  approximately 24% were spent in Canada and
approximately  16% in Mexico,  with the remainder being spent primarily in Peru,
Chile, Australia and the United States.
</P>
<P>
Exploration  is carried out through sole funding and joint  ventures  with major
and junior exploration  companies.  Exploration is focused on areas in proximity
to our existing operations or development  projects in regions which we consider
to have high potential for discovery. Exploration successes in 2004 included the
discovery  of  significant  copper  mineralization  at the 100%  owned  Zafranal
project in Peru and ongoing  drilling on the Morelos Norte (El Limon) project in
Mexico.  Planned  expenditures for 2005 are  approximately  $50 million,  with a
similar geographic and commodity focus.

Proven and  Probable  Mineral  Reserves  and  Measured,  Indicated  and Inferred
Mineral  Resources  have been  estimated in accordance  with the  definitions of
these  terms  adopted  by the  Canadian  Institute  of  Mining,  Metallurgy  and
Petroleum  in November  2004 and  incorporated  in National  Instrument  43-101,
&quot;Standards  of  Disclosure  for  Mineral  Projects&quot;,   by  Canadian   Securities
Regulatory  Authorities.  Estimates  of coal  reserves and  resources  have been
prepared and  classified  using  guidance  from GSC Paper 88-21.  Classification
terminology  conforms with NI 43-101.  Mineral Resources are reported separately
from,  and do  not  include  that  portion  of the  Mineral  Resources  that  is
classified as Mineral  Reserves.  That portion of Mineral  Resource which is not
classified as Mineral Reserve does not have demonstrated  economic value.  There
are no known environmental, permitting, legal, title, taxation, socio political,
marketing or other relevant  issues that would  materially  affect these mineral
reserve and resource estimates.

Definitions
</SPAN>
</P>
<P>
A Mineral Resource is a concentration or occurrence of natural, solid, inorganic
or  fossilized  organic  material  in or on the  Earth's  crust in such form and
quantity and of such a grade or quality  that it has  reasonable  prospects  for
economic extraction.  The location,  quantity, grade, geological characteristics
and continuity of a Mineral  Resource are known,  estimated or interpreted  from
specific geological evidence and knowledge.
</P>
<P>
An  Inferred  Mineral  Resource  is that  part of a Mineral  Resource  for which
quantity  and grade or  quality  can be  estimated  on the  basis of  geological
evidence  and  limited  sampling  and  reasonably  assumed,  but  not  verified,
geological and grade  continuity.  The estimate is based on limited  information
and sampling  gathered  through  appropriate  techniques  from locations such as
outcrops, trenches, pits, workings and drill holes.
</P>
<P>
An  Indicated  Mineral  Resource  is that part of a Mineral  Resource  for which
quantity, grade or quality,  densities, shape and physical characteristics,  can
be estimated  with a level of  confidence  sufficient  to allow the  appropriate
application of technical and economic  parameters,  to support mine planning and
evaluation  of the economic  viability of the deposit.  The estimate is based on
detailed and  reliable  exploration  and testing  information  gathered  through
appropriate techniques from locations such as

A  Measured  Mineral  Resource  is that  part of a  Mineral  Resource  for which
quantity, grade or quality, densities, shape and physical characteristics are so
well established that they can be estimated with confidence  sufficient to allow
the  appropriate  application of technical and economic  parameters,  to support

A Mineral Reserve is the  economically  mineable part of a Measured or Indicated
Mineral Resource demonstrated by at least a Preliminary  Feasibility Study. This
Study must include adequate  information on mining,  processing,  metallurgical,
economic and other relevant factors that demonstrate,  at the time of reporting,
that economic  extraction can be justified.  A Mineral Reserve includes diluting
materials and allowances for losses that may occur when the material is mined.

A Probable Mineral Reserve is the economically mineable part of an Indicated and
in some  circumstances,  a Measured Mineral Resource  demonstrated by at least a
Preliminary  Feasibility Study. This Study must include adequate  information on
mining,  processing,  metallurgical,  economic,  and other relevant factors that
demonstrate,  at  the  time  of  reporting,  that  economic  extraction  can  be

Mineral  reserves at Williams and David Bell have been estimated on the basis of
an assumed gold price of US$350/oz  and mineral  resources  have been  estimated
based on an assumed gold price of US$400/oz.  Underground mineral reserves would
not be  materially  increased  should  the  price of gold  increase,  since  the
extraction   sequence  has  been   established  on  the  basis  of  geotechnical
considerations  as well as  economics,  and has  largely  been  fixed.  Open-pit
mineral  reserves are  sensitive  to price,  cost of  processing,  metallurgical
recovery  and other  factors,  and are subject to change  should  these  factors
change.
</P>
<P>
Mineral  reserves at Pogo have been  estimated on the basis of US$300/oz,  which
was the  assumed  price of gold  used in the  feasibility  study  on  which  the
production  decision  was made.  At the current  gold price of  US$420/oz,  some
additional mineralization on the fringes of the ore body may become economic but
this will not materially  increase the reserves.  Mineral  resources at Pogo and
Morelos have been estimated using an assumed gold price of US$400/oz while those
at  Lobo-Marte  have been  estimated  on the basis of an  assumed  gold price of
US$360/oz.

Highland Valley Copper

Copper mineral  reserves at Highland Valley Copper are estimated on the basis of
an assumed  copper price of  US$0.70/lb.  Mineral  resources are estimated on an
assumed price of  US$0.90/lb.  Conversion of the mineral  resources to reserves,
which  would  extend  the mine life to 2013,  will be  contingent  upon  further
geotechnical  investigations  and the  development of  satisfactory  designs for
extraction of this material.

Antamina
</SPAN>
</P>
<P>
Mineral  reserves at Antamina have been estimated  using an assumed copper price
of US$0.90/lb and US$0.50/lb for zinc.  Extensive  programs of diamond  drilling
were  carried  out in 2003 and 2004 to  improve  local  estimates  and to better
define the distribution of impurities within the ore body. In 2005, the reserves
will be re-estimated  incorporating  this new information and a new ultimate pit
will be  designed.  This may result in changes to the mineral  reserves.  Ore at
Antamina  comprises  two  general  types:  copper  ores,  from which  copper and
molybdenum concentrates may be produced, and copper zinc ores, from which copper
and zinc, but not molybdenum, concentrates are produced. Proven reserves include
stockpiled  material which is expected to be processed  later in the life of the
mine.
</P>
<P>
Red Dog
</P>
<P>
At Red Dog,  mineral  reserves and mineral  resources  mineable by open pit have
been  estimated at an assumed  zinc price of  US$0.55/lb.  Underground  inferred
resources at Red Dog, extraction of which is expected to take place more than 23
years in the future,  have been  estimated on the basis of an assumed zinc price
of US$0.70/lb.
</P>
<P>
<SPAN STYLE="font-weight: bold">
Pend Oreille
</SPAN>
</P>
<P>
Mineral  reserves and  resources at Pend  Oreille have been  estimated  using an
assumed zinc price of  US$0.45/lb  which was the price used in the  feasibility.
Higher  metal  prices will not result in  significant  increases in reserves and
resources,  since  the  boundaries  of the ore  body  are  geological  features.
Conversion  of  resources  to  reserves  would  require  positive  results  from
additional drilling and engineering studies.

<SPAN STYLE="font-weight: bold">
Coal Properties
</SPAN>
</P>
<P>
Coal reserves are coal quantities that are anticipated to be mineable,  based on
feasibility studies,  utilizing existing  technology,  under prevailing economic
conditions and which have no legal impediments to mining.  The coking coal price
assumed in reserve  determination is approximately  US$39 to US$43 per tonne FOB
(free on board) at Roberts Bank  terminal.  Coal reserves are reported in metric
tonnes of clean coal after mining and processing  losses but including coal used
in plant operations.

<SPAN STYLE="font-weight: bold">
Other Resources
</SPAN>
</P>
<P>
Mineral  resources at Sa Dena Hes, Kudz Ze Kayah,  San Nicolas and Lennard Shelf
are based on assumed prices between  US$0.45 and US$0.60/lb for zinc and, in the
case of San Nicolas, US$0.90/lb for copper.

SAFETY AND ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION
</SPAN>
</P>
<P>
Our  current  and  future  operations,   including  development  activities  and
commencement  of  production  on our  properties  or  areas  in which we have an
interest,  are subject to laws and regulations in Canada and elsewhere governing
occupational  health,   waste  disposal,   protection  and  remediation  of  the
environment,  reclamation,  mine  safety,  management  of toxic  substances  and
similar matters. Compliance with these laws and regulations affects the costs of
and can affect the  schedule  for  planning,  designing,  drilling,  developing,
constructing,  operating and closing the Company's  mines,  refineries and other
facilities.
</P>
<P>
Whether  in Canada  or  abroad,  we  attempt  to apply  technically  proven  and
economically   feasible   measures   to  protect  the   environment   throughout
exploration,  mining,  processing  and  closure.  Although  we believe  that our
operations  and  facilities  are  currently  in  substantial  compliance  in all
material respects with all existing laws,  regulations and permits, there can be
no assurance that  additional  significant  costs will not be incurred to comply
with  current  and  future  regulations  or  that  liabilities  associated  with
non-compliance will not occur.
</P>
<P>
Safety  performance  is a key priority for us. Safety  statistics  are collected
from each operation  monthly.  Targets for safety  performance are set each year
and are  used in  determining  management  compensation.  Safety  incidents  are
investigated and finding reports are shared across our business to assist in the
prevention of recurrence of the incident.
</P>
<P>
For accounting  purposes,  current costs  associated with permit  compliance are
treated as normal operating costs necessary to maintain operations on an ongoing
basis.  In addition,  amounts are accrued in our accounts to provide for certain
future  reclamation,   site  restoration  and  other  closure  costs.  Financial
guarantees of various forms are posted, if required,  with various  governmental
authorities  as  security  to  cover  estimated  reclamation  obligations.   Our
provisions  for  future  reclamation  and site  restoration  are  based on known
requirements.  It is not currently  possible to estimate the impact on operating
results, if any, of future legislative or regulatory developments.
</P>
<P>
We conduct  regular  environmental  and safety and health  audits.  The  overall
objective  of our audits is to identify  environment,  health and safety  risks,
assess  regulatory  compliance and  conformance  with applicable laws and assess
conformance with appropriate  environment,  health and safety management systems
and good management practices.
</P>
<P>
All of our mining  operations  have closure and  reclamation  plans in place and
these  undergo  regular  updates.  The  reclamation  programs are guided by land
capability  assessments,  which  integrate  several  factors in the  reclamation
approach   including   biological   diversity,   establishment   of  sustainable
vegetation,  diversity  of physical  landforms  and  requirements  for  wildlife
habitat. In addition to reclamation of operating mines,  certain idle and closed
mines are under continuous care and maintenance as well as progressive  closure.
Our Code requires that sites be reclaimed in an appropriate  manner. We manage a
number of decommissioned mine sites in Canada and conduct regular inspections to
verify the success of reclamation activities.

</P>
<P>
The Code sets out specific requirements in areas related to (i) legal compliance
and ethical business  conduct,  (ii) prohibition of  discriminatory  conduct and
commitment  to  decision-making  on job  selection  on the  basis of  merit  and
ability,  (iii)  striving to  identify,  control  and promote  safety and health

their development.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the Charter and Code, we have adopted a Health and Safety Policy,
a Health and Safety Guide for Exploration,  and a Code of Ethics.  We have taken
steps  to  implement  the  Charter,   Code  and  policies  through  adoption  of
Environmental,  Health and Safety Management Standards,  which provide direction
to all  operations  and  auditable  criteria  against  which the  standards  are
measured.
</P>
<P>
We set  objectives in these areas for  improvement  on an annual basis and these
are used to determine  specific  objectives for corporate and operational groups
within our organization.  Overall  responsibility  for achievement of objectives
rest with senior personnel.  Our  Environmental,  Health and Safety Committee of
the Board, which reports to the Board of Directors and our Corporate Environment
and Risk Management Committee and our Product Stewardship  Committee,  which are
comprised or members of senior management, provide oversight in these areas.
</P>
<P>
We measure our  performance  on an ongoing  and  comprehensive  basis.  Internal
monthly and quarterly  environmental  reporting  tracks  performance  indicators
including compliance with permits,  environmental monitoring,  health and safety
performance,  materials  inputs and outputs,  community  concerns  expressed and
actions taken in response,  and amount of reclaimed  land. We report publicly on
our performance through our Sustainability Report and website.

FOREIGN OPERATIONS
</SPAN>
</P>
<P>
The Red Dog mine and the Pogo development project located in Alaska, U.S.A., the
Pend Oreille project in Washington  State and the Antamina mine located in Peru,
are our  significant  assets  located  outside  of  Canada.  In 2004 we sold our
interest in the Cajamarquilla  zinc refinery in Peru. We hold our 22.5% interest
in Antamina directly through our equity interest in the operating company of the
project,  CMA. We hold a 100%  interest  in the Red Dog mine.  The Red Dog mine,
Pend Oreille and the Antamina mine  accounted  for 28% of our 2004  consolidated
revenue and,  together  with Pogo,  represented  approximately  38% of our total
assets in 2004.
</P>
<P>
We also have  interests  in various  exploration  and  development  projects  in
various foreign  countries,  with  significant  activities in the United States,
Mexico,  Peru, Chile, Brazil,  Australia,  Turkey and Namibia. We currently have
foreign exploration offices in all of the foregoing countries.

<SPAN STYLE="font-weight: bold">
COMPETITIVE CONDITIONS
</SPAN>
</P>
<P>
Our business is to sell base metals,  metal concentrates,  by-product metals and
concentrate,  metallurgical  coal and gold at prices determined by world markets
over  which  we have no  influence  or  control.  Our  competitive  position  is
determined  by our costs  compared to those of other  producers  throughout  the
world, and by our ability to maintain our financial  integrity through metal and
coal price cycles and currency  fluctuations.  Costs are governed principally by
the location,  grade and nature of ore bodies and mineral deposits, the location
of our metal refining  facility and its cost of power and, as well, by operating
and management  skill. We reduce our exposure to metal price cycles and currency
fluctuations  through our hedging program. See &quot;Commodity Price Fluctuations and
Hedging&quot; on page 30 for further details.
</P>
<P>
Over the long term,  our  competitive  position is  determined by our ability to
locate,  acquire and develop economic ore bodies and replace current production.
In this  regard,  we also  compete  with  other  mining  companies  for  mineral
properties,  for joint venture agreements and for the acquisition of investments
in other mining companies.

RISK FACTORS
</SPAN>
</P>
<P>
The following  discussion pertains to the outlook and conditions currently known
to management which could have a material impact on the financial  condition and
results of operations of our business.  This discussion,  by its nature,  is not
all-inclusive.  It is not a guarantee that other factors will or will not affect
us in the future.  This discussion  should be read in conjunction  with material
contained in other sections of this Annual Information Form.
</P>
<P>
<SPAN STYLE="font-weight: bold">
Risks Inherent in the Mining and Metals Business
</SPAN>
</P>
<P>
The  business of exploring  for minerals is  inherently  risky.  Few  properties
explored are ultimately developed into producing mines.
</P>
<P>
Mineral  properties  are  often   non-productive  for  reasons  that  cannot  be
anticipated in advance.  Even after the commencement of mining operations,  such
operations may be subject to risks and hazards, including environmental hazards,
industrial accidents, unusual or unexpected geological formations, unanticipated
metallurgical  difficulties,  ground  control  problems and flooding.  The Trail
metallurgical operations, concentrate mills and coal preparation plants are also
subject to risks of process upsets and equipment malfunctions. The occurrence of
any of the  foregoing  could  result  in  damage to or  destruction  of  mineral
properties and production facilities,  personal injuries,  environmental damage,
delays or interruption of production,  increases in production  costs,  monetary
losses, legal liability and adverse governmental action.
</P>
<P>
Our property,  business  interruption  and  liability  insurance may not provide
sufficient  coverage  for losses  related to these or other  hazards.  Insurance
against  certain  risks,   including   certain   liabilities  for  environmental
pollution, may not be available to us or to other companies within the industry.
In addition, insurance coverage may not continue to be available at economically
feasible  premiums,  or at all.  Any such event  could  have a material  adverse
effect on our business.
</P>
<P>
<SPAN STYLE="font-weight: bold">
Commodity Price Fluctuations and Hedging
</SPAN>
</P>
<P>
The results of our operations are significantly  affected by the market price of
base metals,  specialty metals,  metallurgical  coal and gold which are cyclical
and subject to substantial  price  fluctuations.  Our earnings are  particularly
sensitive to changes in the market price of zinc, copper and metallurgical coal.
Market prices can be affected by numerous factors beyond our control,  including
levels  of  supply  and  demand  for  a  broad  range  of  industrial  products,
expectations with respect to the rate of inflation, the relative strength of the
U.S. dollar and of certain other currencies,  interest rates, global or regional
political  or  economic  crises and sales of gold and base  metals by holders in
response  to such  factors.  If prices  should  decline  below our cash costs of
production  and  remain  at such  levels  for any  sustained  period,  we  could
determine that it is not economically feasible to continue commercial production
at any or all of our mines.
</P>
<P>
The  objectives of our hedging  programs are to reduce the risk of a commodity's
market price while optimizing  upside  participation,  to maintain adequate cash
flows  and  profitability  to  contribute  to  the  long-term  viability  of our
business.  There are, however,  risks associated with hedging programs including
(among other  things),  an increase in the price of the relevant  commodity,  an
increase  in gold lease  rates (in the case of gold  hedging),  an  increase  in
interest  rates,  rising  operating  costs,  counter-party  risks and production
interruption  events.  Prices of diesel and electricity also fluctuate and these
fluctuations affect the costs of production at various operations.

<SPAN STYLE="font-weight: bold">
Competition for Mining Properties
</SPAN>
</P>
<P>
Because the life of a mine is limited by its ore  reserves,  we are  continually
seeking  to replace  and expand our  reserves  through  the  exploration  of our
existing  properties  as  well  as  through  acquisitions  of  interests  in new
properties or of interests in companies which own such properties.  We encounter
strong   competition   from  other  mining  companies  in  connection  with  the
acquisition of properties.
</P>
<P>
<SPAN STYLE="font-weight: bold">
Future Market Access
</SPAN>
</P>
<P>
Access  to  our  markets  is  subject  to  the  risk  of  interruptions  or  the
establishment  of trade  barriers  due to  policies  and  tariffs of  individual
countries,  and the actions of certain interest groups to restrict the import of
certain commodities.  Although there are currently no significant trade barriers
existing or impending of which we are aware that do, or could, materially affect
our  access to certain  markets,  there can be no  assurance  that our access to
these markets will not be restricted in the future.
</P>
<P>
<SPAN STYLE="font-weight: bold">
Mineral Reserve and Resource Estimates
</SPAN>
</P>
<P>
Disclosed reserve estimates should not be interpreted as assurances of mine life
or of the profitability of current or future operations. We estimate our mineral
reserves  in  accordance  with  the  requirements  of  the  applicable  Canadian
securities regulatory authorities and established mining standards.
</P>
<P>
The  Securities  and  Exchange  Commission  (the &quot;SEC&quot;)  does not permit  mining
companies in their filings with the SEC to disclose estimates other than mineral
reserves. However, because we prepare this Annual Information Form in accordance
with Canadian disclosure requirements, this annual information form incorporates
estimates  of  mineral  resources.   Mineral  resources  are  concentrations  or
occurrences  of  minerals  that are  judged  to have  reasonable  prospects  for
economic  extraction,  but for which the economics of  extraction  have not been
assessed,  whether because of insufficiency of geological information or lack of
feasibility  analysis,  or for which economic  extraction cannot be justified at
the time of reporting.  Consequently, mineral resources are of a higher risk and
are less  likely to be  accurately  estimated  or  economically  recovered  than
mineral reserves.
</P>
<P>
Our reserves and  resources  are  estimated by persons who are  employees of the
respective  operating  entities for each of our operations under the supervision
of our  employees.  These  individuals  are not  &quot;independent&quot;  for  purposes of
applicable  securities  legislation.  We do not use  outside  sources  to verify
reserves or resources.  The mineral reserve and resource figures incorporated in
this  Annual  Information  Form are  estimates  based on the  interpretation  of
limited sampling and subjective  judgments  regarding the grade,  continuity and
existence of mineralization, as well as the application of economic assumptions,
including  assumptions as to operating costs,  foreign exchange rates and future
metal prices.  The  sampling,  interpretations  or  assumptions  underlying  any
reserve  or  resource  estimate  may be  incorrect,  and the  impact on  mineral
reserves or resources may be material. In addition, short term operating factors
relating to mineral  reserves,  such as the need for orderly  development of ore
bodies or the  processing of new or different  ores,  may cause mineral  reserve
estimates to be modified or  operations  to be  unprofitable  in any  particular
fiscal period.
</P>
<P>
There  can be no  assurance  that  the  indicated  amount  of  minerals  will be
recovered or that they will be  recovered at the prices  assumed for purposes of
estimating reserves.

Currency Fluctuations
</SPAN>
</P>
<P>
Our  operating  results and cash flow are  affected  by changes in the  Canadian
dollar  exchange rate relative to the  currencies of other  countries.  Exchange
rate movements can have a significant impact on results as a significant portion
of our operating costs are incurred in Canadian and other  currencies and almost
all  revenues  are earned in U.S.  dollars.  To reduce the  exposure to currency
fluctuations,  we enter into limited  foreign  exchange  contracts  from time to
time, but such hedges do not eliminate the potential that such  fluctuations may
have an adverse effect on our business. In addition,  foreign exchange contracts
expose us to the risk of default by the counterparties to such contracts,  which
could have a material adverse effect on our business.
</P>
<P>
<SPAN STYLE="font-weight: bold">
Interest Rate Risk
</SPAN>
</P>
<P>
Our exposure to changes in interest  rates results from  investing and borrowing
activities  undertaken  to manage  liquidity and capital  requirements.  We have
incurred  indebtedness that bears interest at fixed and floating rates, and have
entered into interest rate swap  agreements  to  effectively  convert some fixed
rate exposure to floating rate exposure.  There can be no assurance that we will
not be materially  adversely affected by interest rate changes in the future. In
addition,  our use of interest  rate swaps  exposes us to the risk of default by
the counterparties to such arrangements.  Any such default could have a material
adverse effect on our business.
</P>
<P>
<SPAN STYLE="font-weight: bold">
Environment
</SPAN>
</P>
<P>
Environmental   legislation  affects  nearly  all  aspects  of  our  operations.
Compliance with environmental  legislation can require significant  expenditures
and  failure  to  comply  with  environmental  legislation  may  result  in  the
imposition of fines and  penalties,  clean up costs arising out of  contaminated
properties,  damages  and the  loss of  important  permits.  Exposure  to  these
liabilities arises not only from existing  operations,  but from operations that
have been  closed  or sold to third  parties.  Our  historical  operations  have
generated significant  environmental  contamination.  There can be no assurances
that we will at all times be in compliance with all environmental regulations or
that steps to  achieve  compliance  would not  materially  adversely  affect our
business.
</P>
<P>
Environmental  laws and regulations are evolving in all  jurisdictions  where we
have  activities.  We are not able to determine the specific  impact that future
changes in  environmental  laws and  regulations  may have on our operations and
activities,  and its resulting financial  position;  however, we anticipate that
capital  expenditures  and  operating  expenses will increase in the future as a
result  of the  implementation  of new and  increasingly  stringent  environment
regulation.  Further changes in environmental  laws, new information on existing
environmental conditions or other events, including legal proceedings based upon
such  conditions  or an inability to obtain  necessary  permits,  could  require
increased  financial  reserves or compliance  expenditures  or otherwise  have a
material adverse effect on our business.  Changes in  environmental  legislation
could also have a material adverse effect on product demand, product quality and
methods of production and distribution.
</P>
<P>
<SPAN STYLE="font-weight: bold">
Aboriginal Title Claims
</SPAN>
</P>
<P>
Recent Canadian  jurisprudence  requires  governments to consult with aboriginal
peoples with  respect to grants of mineral  rights and the issuance or amendment
of  project  authorizations.  This may affect  our  ability to acquire  within a
reasonable  time  frame  effective  mineral  titles  in some  parts  of  Canada,
particularly British Columbia, in which aboriginal title is claimed. The risk of
unforeseen aboriginal title

Foreign Activities

Our  business  operates in a number of foreign  countries  where there are added
risks and  uncertainties due to the different  economic,  cultural and political
environments.  Some of these risks include  nationalization  and  expropriation,
social unrest and political  instability,  uncertainties  in perfecting  mineral
titles,  trade barriers and exchange  controls and material changes in taxation.
Further, developing country status or unfavourable political climate may make it
difficult for us to obtain financing for projects in some countries.

Legal Proceedings

The  nature  of  our  business  subjects  the  Company  to  numerous  regulatory
investigations, claims, lawsuits and other proceedings in the ordinary course of

DIVIDENDS

<P>
Our Class A common shares and Class B subordinate  voting shares rank equally as
to the  payment of  dividends.  We may not pay  dividends  on the Class A common
shares  and Class B  subordinate  voting  shares  unless  all  dividends  on any
preferred  shares  outstanding  have been paid to date.  Dividends  of $0.20 per
share were paid in 2002 and 2003 on both the Class A common shares and the Class

Class  A  common  shares  carry  the  right  to 100  votes  per  share.  Class B

subordinate  voting share. In all other respects,  the Class A common shares and
Class B subordinate voting shares rank equally.

In November  2003,  the Company  issued  790,000  Series 1 and 550,000  Series 2
preference  shares to replace certain  preference  shares issued by Teck Cominco
Metals.  These shares entitle the holders to receive  dividends and  redemptions
based upon a rate of return index  governed by world prices for lead and silver.
The rate of return index to date has been  insufficient  to trigger any dividend
or redemption.  Based on foreseeable metal prices,  these shares are expected to
expire in March 2006 without any dividends or redemptions.

Credit ratings are intended to provide investors with an independent  measure of
the  credit  quality  of an  issue  of  securities  and  are  indicators  of the
likelihood of payment and of the capacity and  willingness  of a company to meet
its financial  commitment  on an obligation in accordance  with the terms of the
obligation.  A  description  of the  rating  categories  of each  of the  rating
agencies in the table above is set out below.
</P>
<P>
Credit ratings are not recommendations to purchase,  hold or sell securities and
do not address the market  price or  suitability  of a specific  security  for a
particular investor.  Credit ratings may not reflect the potential impact of all
risks on the value of securities.  In addition,  real or anticipated  changes in
the rating assigned to a security will generally affect the market value of that
security. We cannot assure you that a rating will remain in effect for any given
period of time or that a rating will not be revised or  withdrawn  entirely by a
rating agency in the future.

<P>
S&amp;P's long-term  credit ratings are on a rating scale that ranges from AAA to D,
which  represents the range from highest to lowest quality of securities  rated.
S&amp;P's BBB rating assigned to our senior unsecured debt instruments is the fourth
highest rating of 10 major rating categories.  A &quot;BBB&quot; rating indicates that the
obligor's  capacity to meet its financial  commitment is adequate,  but that the
obligation  is  somewhat  more  susceptible  to  adverse  effects  of changes in
circumstances   and  economic   conditions  than  obligations  in  higher  rated
categories.  S&amp;P uses &quot;+&quot; or &quot;-&quot; designations to indicate the relative  standing
of  securities  within a particular  rating  category.  S&amp;P has also  assigned a

DBRS's long-term credit ratings are on a rating scale that ranges from AAA to D,
which  represents the range from highest to lowest quality of securities  rated.
DBRS's BBB (high) rating  assigned to our senior  unsecured debt and BBB (high)m
to the exchangeable debentures is the fourth highest of the 10 rating categories
for long-term debt.  Debt securities  rated &quot;BBB&quot; are of adequate credit quality
and  protection  of interest and  principal is  considered  acceptable,  but the
obligor is fairly  susceptible  to adverse  changes in  financial  and  economic
changes,  or there may be other  adverse  conditions  present  which  reduce the
strength of the obligor.  A reference  to &quot;high&quot; or &quot;low&quot;  reflects the relative
strength  within the rating  category.  A  reference  to &quot;m&quot;  reflects  that the
potential for volatility due to market risk factors  greatly  exceeds what would
be considered  normal.  DBRS has also assigned a stable  outlook to the ratings,
which helps give  investors an  understanding  of DBRS's  opinion  regarding the
outlook for the ratings.

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS
</SPAN>
</P>
<P>
We are subject to two potentially  material legal proceedings:  a citizens' suit
brought  by two  members  of the  Colville  Confederated  Tribes  to  enforce  a
universal  administrative  order  issued  by the U.S.  Environmental  Protection
Agency in relation to Lake Roosevelt;  and a multi-jurisdictional  industry-wide
investigation  by competition  authorities  involving  major copper  concentrate
producers, including HVC. These matters are described below.
</P>
<P>
On November 11, 2004, the District Court for Eastern  Washington  State denied a
motion by Teck Cominco Metals to dismiss, for want of jurisdiction,  a citizen's
suit brought by two members of the Colville Confederated Tribes supported by the
State of  Washington.  Teck  Cominco  Metals  has  petitioned  for appeal of the
decision to the 9th Circuit Court of Appeal.
</P>
<P>
The  Colville  suit  was  brought  pursuant  to  Section  310(a)(i)  of the U.S.
Superfund Statute (CERCLA) to enforce a unilateral  administrative  order issued
by the U.S.  Environmental  Protection  Agency (EPA)  purporting to require Teck
Cominco Metals to conduct a remedial  investigation  and feasibility  study with
respect to metal  contamination in the sediments of the Upper Columbia River and
Lake Roosevelt. The EPA issued the order shortly after breaking off negotiations
with Teck Cominco  Metals during which Teck Cominco Metals offered to fund human
health and ecological studies, at an estimated cost of US$13 million, to address
the  possible  impact of  historical  discharges  from the  Trail  Metallurgical
Operations in British  Columbia.  Both the Canadian  government  and the Company
have the view  that the EPA does  not have  jurisdiction  to apply  U.S.  law in
Canada.
</P>
<P>
The  Government of Canada and the Government of the United States are continuing
to pursue a bilateral  agreement  to  facilitate  the  studies  and  appropriate
remediation to address environmental  concerns about the area. Such an agreement
could provide a basis under which Teck Cominco Metal's offer of funding for this
work could be implemented.

<P>
There can be no  assurance  that the offer to fund the studies  will resolve the
matter,  or that Teck  Cominco  Metal or its  affiliates  will not be faced with
liability in relation to this matter.  Until studies of the kind described above
are  completed,  it is not possible to estimate the extent and cost,  if any, of
remediation that may be required.
</P>
<P>
Teck Cominco  Metals,  as the marketing agent for HVC, has responded to an Order
issued by the Federal Court of Canada pursuant to the Competition Act to produce
documents relevant to the marketing of custom copper concentrates. We understand
that this is part of an  ongoing  industry-wide  investigation  involving  major
copper concentrate  producers  commenced in Canada, the United States and Europe
to determine whether there is evidence of a cartel agreement and related illegal
practices  concerning  pricing,  customer  allocation  and market sharing in the
copper concentrate  sector. We have been advised by the United States Department
of Justice that it intends to close its investigation. There can be no assurance
that the investigation  will not result in further  regulatory action against us
or HVC in Canada or  elsewhere  or that we or HVC will not face  prosecution  or
liability  under the Act or otherwise in relation to the  investigation.  We can
also  offer  no  guidance  or   assurance  as  to  the  course  of  the  ongoing
investigation  or when  the  ongoing  investigation  will be  completed.  We are
cooperating in the continuing investigation.
</P>
<P>
We are subject to a variety of other legal proceedings in the ordinary course of
business.  We do not  believe  that  the  outcome  of any of  these  proceedings
represents a material risk to our business or properties.

AUDITORS' REPORT
<BR>
to the Shareholders of Teck Cominco Limited
</SPAN>
</P>
<P>
We have audited the consolidated balance sheets of TECK COMINCO LIMITED as at
December 31, 2004 and 2003 and the consolidated statements of earnings, retained
earnings and cash flows for the each of the years in the three-year period ended
December 31, 2004. These consolidated financial statements are the
responsibility of the company's management. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.
</P>
<P>
We conducted our audits in accordance with Canadian generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform an audit to obtain
reasonable assurance whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
</P>
<P>
In our opinion, these consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all
material respects, the financial position of the company as at December 31, 2004
and 2003 and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the
years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2004 in accordance with
Canadian generally accepted accounting principles.

COMMENTS BY AUDITORS FOR UNITED STATES READERS ON CANADA-UNITED STATES REPORTING
DIFFERENCES
</SPAN>
</P>
<P>
In the United States, reporting standards for auditors require the addition of
an explanatory paragraph (following the opinion paragraph) when there are
changes in accounting principles that have a material effect on the
comparability of the company's financial statements, such as the changes
described in note 3 to the financial statements. Our report to the shareholders
dated February 4, 2005 is expressed in accordance with Canadian reporting
standards which do not require a reference to such a change in accounting
principles in the auditors' report when the change is properly accounted for and
adequately disclosed in the financial statements.

1.    NATURE OF OPERATIONS
</P>
<P>
Teck  Cominco  Limited  (the  company) is engaged in mining and base metal
refining   businesses   including   exploration,    development,   mining,
processing,  smelting and refining. The company's major products are zinc,
metallurgical coal, copper, precious metals, lead, molybdenum,  electrical
power,  fertilizers  and  specialty  metals.  Revenue from  refined  lead,
electrical  power,  fertilizers  and  specialty  metals earned at smelting
operations  are included in zinc smelter  revenue for segmented  purposes.
All  revenue  from a mine  is  included  in one  segment  based  upon  the
principal product of the mine.
</P>
<P>
2.    SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
</P>
<P CLASS="eolCenter">
<SPAN STYLE="font-weight: bold">
Generally  Accepted  Accounting  Principles
</SPAN>
</P>
<P>
The consolidated financial statements of the company are prepared using
generally accepted accounting principles in Canada. Note 20 reconciles the
company's earnings and shareholders' equity to results that would have
been obtained had the company's consolidated financial statements been
prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in
the United States.
</P>
<P CLASS="eolCenter">
<SPAN STYLE="font-weight: bold">
Basis of Presentation
</SPAN>
</P>
<P>
These  consolidated  financial  statements  include  the  accounts  of the
company and all of its subsidiaries.  The significant subsidiaries include
Teck Comino Metals Limited (TCML),  Teck Cominco American Inc. (TCAI), and
Teck Cominco Alaska Inc. (TCAK).  Many of the company's mining  activities
are conducted through  interests in joint ventures and partnerships  where
the company  shares joint control.  These joint ventures and  partnerships
are accounted for using the proportionate consolidation method.
</P>
<P CLASS="eolCenter">
<SPAN STYLE="font-weight: bold">
Use of Estimates
</SPAN>
</P>
<P>
The  preparation  of financial  statements  in conformity  with  generally
accepted  accounting  principles requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial
statements.  Significant  areas  where  management's  judgment  is applied
include  asset and  investment  valuations,  ore  reserve  determinations,
in-process  inventory  quantities,  plant and equipment lives,  contingent
liabilities,   tax  provisions  and  future  income  tax  balances,  asset
retirement   obligations,   pension   liabilities,   and   other   accrued
liabilities.  Ore reserve determinations involve estimates of future costs
and future  commodity  prices.  Actual  results  could  differ  from these
estimates.
</P>
<P CLASS="eolCenter">
<SPAN STYLE="font-weight: bold">
Translation of Foreign Currencies
</SPAN>
</P>
<P>
For integrated  foreign  operations,  monetary  assets and liabilities are
translated at year-end exchange rates and other assets and liabilities are
translated  at  historical  rates.  Revenues,  expenses and cash flows are
translated  at  monthly  average  exchange  rates.  Gains  and  losses  on
translation  of monetary  assets and monetary  liabilities  are charged to
earnings, except where hedge designations exist.
</P>
<P>
The accounts of  self-sustaining  foreign  operations  are  translated  at
year-end  exchange  rates,  and revenues and  expenses are  translated  at
monthly  average  exchange rates.  Differences  arising from these foreign
currency translations are recorded in shareholders' equity as a cumulative
translation  adjustment  until they are  realized  by a  reduction  in the
investment.
</P>
<P CLASS="eolCenter">
<SPAN STYLE="font-weight: bold">
Cash
</SPAN>
</P>
<P>
Cash includes cash on account,  demand deposits and short-term investments
with original maturities of three months or less.

2.    SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES, continued
</P>
<P CLASS="eolCenter">
<SPAN STYLE="font-weight: bold">
Investments
</SPAN>
</P>
<P>
Investments,  other than the investment in the Fording Canadian Coal Trust
(FCCT),  comprise  marketable and other securities.  Other investments are
carried at cost less any amounts  written off to reflect an  impairment in
value which is other than temporary. The investment in FCCT is recorded at
cost plus the company's share of earnings less the cash distributions.
</P>
<P CLASS="eolCenter">
<SPAN STYLE="font-weight: bold">
Product Inventories
</SPAN>
</P>
<P>
Product  inventories  include finished goods, raw materials and in-process
inventories and are valued at the lower of cost and net realizable  value.
Cost includes all direct costs  incurred in production  including  freight
and  depreciation  and  amortization  charges related to the production of
inventory. For mining operations,  inventories are not valued prior to the
production of concentrates or clean coal.
</P>
<P CLASS="eolCenter">
<SPAN STYLE="font-weight: bold">
Property, Plant and Equipment
</SPAN>
</P>
<P>
(i)   Plant and equipment
</P>
<P>
Plant and equipment are depreciated  over the estimated lives of the
related assets  calculated on a units of production or straight-line
basis as appropriate.
</P>
<P>
(ii)  Mineral properties and deferred costs
</P>
<P>
Exploration  costs and costs of  acquiring  mineral  properties  are
charged to earnings in the year in which they are  incurred,  except
where  these  costs   relate  to  specific   properties   for  which
economically  recoverable reserves as shown by an economic study are
believed to exist, in which case they are deferred.
</P>
<P>
Deferred costs include  interest and financing costs relating to the
construction  of plant  and  equipment  and  operating  costs net of
revenues prior to the  commencement of commercial  production of new
mines.  Interest and financing costs are capitalized  only for those
projects for which funds have been borrowed.
</P>
<P>
Upon  commencement  of production,  mineral  properties and deferred
costs relating to mines are amortized over the estimated life of the
proven and probable  reserves to which they relate  calculated  on a
units of production basis.
</P>
<P>
(iii) Underground development costs
</P>
<P>
Underground   development   costs  are  amortized  using  the  block
amortization  method,  whereby  capital costs  associated  with each
section  of the  mine  are  amortized  over  the  reserves  of  that
particular section of the mine.
</P>
<P>
(iv)  Asset impairment
</P>
<P>
The company  performs  impairment  tests on its property,  plant and
equipment when events or changes in  circumstance  indicate that the
carrying value of assets may not be recoverable. These tests compare
expected  undiscounted  future cash flows from these assets to their
carrying values. If shortfalls exist, assets are written down to the
discounted  value of the future  cash flows  based on the  company's
average cost of borrowing.

</SPAN>
</P>
<P>
Sales are recognized and revenues are recorded at market prices when title
transfers  and  the  rights  and  obligations  of  ownership  pass  to the
customer.  A number of the company's  concentrate  products are sold under
pricing  arrangements  where final prices are  determined by quoted market
prices in a period subsequent to the date of sale. These  concentrates are
provisionally  priced at the time of sale based on forward  prices for the
expected date of the final settlement.  Subsequent variations in the price
are  recognized  as revenue  adjustments  as they occur until the price is
finalized.
</P>
<P>
The company  standardized the timing of revenue recognition for all of its
operations  in  2003.  This  resulted  in an $8  million  increase  in net
earnings in 2003 but had no material effect on reported earnings of 2002.
</P>
<P CLASS="eolCenter">
<SPAN STYLE="font-weight: bold">
Income and Resource Taxes
</SPAN>
</P>
<P>
Future  income tax  assets and  liabilities  are  determined  based on the
difference  between the tax basis of the company's  assets and liabilities
and the respective  amounts reported in the financial  statements.  Future
tax  assets  or  liabilities  are  calculated  using the tax rates for the
periods in which the  differences  are expected to be settled.  Future tax
assets are recognized to the extent that they are  considered  more likely
than not to be realized.
</P>
<P CLASS="eolCenter">
<SPAN STYLE="font-weight: bold">
Pension and Other Employee Future Benefits
</SPAN>
</P>
<P>
Pension and other employee  future  benefits and  liabilities are based on
actuarial  determinations.   The  projected  benefit  method  prorated  on
services  has been  used to  determine  the  accrued  benefit  obligation.
Certain actuarial assumptions used in the determination of defined benefit
pension plan liabilities and other post-retirement benefits are based upon
management's best estimates,  including expected plan performance,  salary
escalation, expected health care costs, and retirement dates of employees.
The discount  rate used to determine  the accrued  benefit  obligation  is
determined by reference to the market  interest  rates at the  measurement
date of high quality debt instruments.  The expected return on plan assets
is based on the expected  long-term  rate of return on plan assets and the
fair value of plan assets.
</P>
<P>
Past service costs and transitional assets or liabilities are amortized on
a straight-line  basis over the average remaining service period of active
employees  expected  to  receive  benefits  under  the plan up to the full
eligibility date.
</P>
<P>
Differences between the actuarial  liabilities and the amounts recorded in
financial statements will arise from changes in plan assumptions,  changes
in  benefits,  or through  experience  as results  differ  from  actuarial
assumptions.  Differences  which are greater than 10% of the fair value of
the plan  assets or the  accrued  benefit  obligation  are taken  into the
determination  of income over the average  remaining  service  life of the
related employees.
</P>
<P>
The cost of  providing  benefits  through  defined  contribution  plans is
charged  to  earnings  as  the   obligation  to  contribute  is  incurred.
Non-pension  post-retirement  benefits  are funded by the  company as they
become due.
</P>
<P CLASS="eolCenter">
<SPAN STYLE="font-weight: bold">
Stock-Based Compensation
</SPAN>
</P>
<P>
Effective  January 1, 2004, the company  adopted the new provisions of the
CICA  Handbook  Section  3870  on  &quot;Stock-Based   Compensation  and  Other
Stock-Based Payments&quot;,  which uses the fair value method of accounting for
stock-based  awards.  Under this method,  the compensation cost of options
and other  stock-based  compensation  arrangements  are  estimated at fair
value  at  the  grant  date  and  recognized   over  the  vesting  period.
Previously,  the company  disclosed  the pro forma  effect of  stock-based
compensation expense in the notes to the financial statements.

Asset Retirement Obligations
</SPAN>
</P>
<P>
Effective  January 1, 2004, the company adopted CICA Handbook Section 3110
on &quot;Asset Retirement Obligations&quot;. Under this standard, future obligations
to  retire  an  asset  including  dismantling,   remediation  and  ongoing
treatment and monitoring of the site are initially recognized and recorded
as a  liability  at fair  value,  assuming  a  credit  adjusted  risk-free
discount  rate and an  inflation  factor.  The  liability  is adjusted for
changes in the  expected  amounts  and timing of cash  flows  required  to
discharge  the  liability  and  accreted  to full value over time  through
periodic charges to earnings. The amount of the asset retirement liability
initially  recognized is capitalized as part of the asset's carrying value
and amortized over the asset's estimated useful life.
</P>
<P>
Under the standard,  future asset retirement obligations are only recorded
when  the  timing  or  amount  of  remediation  costs  can  be  reasonably
estimated.  The cost and timing of asset  retirement  obligations  for the
company's  mines and legacy sites can be  estimated  and  liabilities  are
recorded  for each of these  sites.  The  company's  refining and smelting
facilities are considered to be indefinite life operations and neither the
timing nor amounts that may be required to retire these  facilities can be
estimated at this time. In these cases recorded liabilities are limited to
secondary sites and components of the facilities  where costs and expected
dates of retirement and remediation are capable of estimation. Previously,
the company  accrued  reclamation  costs on a straight line basis over the
estimated life of each mine.
</P>
<P CLASS="eolCenter">
<SPAN STYLE="font-weight: bold">
Earnings Per Share
</SPAN>
</P>
<P>
Earnings per share is calculated  based on the weighted  average number of
shares  outstanding  during the year.  The company  follows the  `treasury
stock' method in the calculation of diluted earnings per share. Under this
method,  dilution is calculated based upon the net number of common shares
issued  should `in the money'  options and warrants be  exercised  and the
proceeds are used to  repurchase  common  shares at the  weighted  average
market  price in the  period.  Dilution  from  convertible  securities  is
calculated  based on the number of shares to be issued  after  taking into
account the reduction of the related after-tax interest expense.
</P>
<P CLASS="eolCenter">
<SPAN STYLE="font-weight: bold">
Derivatives and Hedging Activities
</SPAN>
</P>
<P>
The company uses forward foreign  exchange and commodity price  contracts,
and  interest  rate swaps to manage  exposure to  fluctuations  in foreign
exchange, metal prices and interest rates. On January 1, 2004, the company
adopted Accounting  Guideline 13 (AcG-13) &quot;Hedging  Relationships&quot; and EIC
<BR>
128  &quot;Accounting  for  Trading,  Speculative  or  Non  Trading  Derivative
Financial Instruments&quot;.  No adjustment was required to opening balances as
a result of the adoption of this standard.
</P>
<P>
Certain of the company's  commodity and foreign exchange forward contracts
are  accounted  for as cash flow hedges of  anticipated  commodity  sales.
Realized gains or losses on these contracts are recognized in revenue. The
Inco  exchangeable  debenture is also  accounted for as a cash flow hedge.
The company's  interest rate swaps are accounted for as fair value hedges,
with realized gains or losses recognized in interest expense.  The company
also designates a portion of its US dollar debt as a hedge of a portion of
its net investment in foreign  subsidiaries  whose functional  currency is
the US dollar.  Foreign  exchange gains and losses on the designated  debt
are included in the  cumulative  translation  adjustment in  shareholders'
equity.  Derivative  instruments  that do not  qualify  as a  hedge  under
AcG-13,  or are not  designated  as a hedge,  are  recorded on the balance
sheet at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in earnings.

(a)   Asset retirement obligations
</P>
<P>
On January 1, 2004, the company  adopted CICA Handbook  Section 3110
&quot;Asset  Retirement  Obligations&quot;.  The retroactive  adoption of this
standard resulted in a restatement as of January 1, 2004 to increase
long-term  liability by $210 million,  increase property,  plant and
equipment by $113 million,  reduce future income tax  liabilities by
$23 million and decrease opening retained earnings by $74 million.
</P>
<P>
(b)   Stock-based compensation
</P>
<P>
Effective January 1, 2004, the company adopted CICA Handbook Section
3870  &quot;Stock-Based  Compensation  and Other  Stock-Based  Payments&quot;,
which  uses the fair  value  method of  accounting  for  stock-based
awards.  The company has applied the new provisions with retroactive
restatement.  As a result,  a  cumulative  decrease of $8 million to
retained earnings,  an increase of $7 million to contributed surplus
and an  increase  of $1 million to share  capital  were  recorded on
January 1, 2004 with  respect to stock  options  granted in 2003 and
2002.
</P>
<P>
(c)   Underground development amortization
</P>
<P>
Effective  January  1,  2004,  the  company  has  adopted  the block
amortization  method for amortizing  underground  development costs.
Under this method capital costs  associated  with the development of
each  section of the mine are  amortized  over the  reserves of that
particular   section  of  the  mine.   Previously  all   capitalized
underground  development  costs were  amortized over the reserves of
the mine as a whole.  As a result  of this  change  in  policy,  the
company  has  recorded  an  adjustment   reducing  opening  retained
earnings by $4 million; property, plant and equipment by $7 million;
and  reducing   future  income  tax   liabilities   by  $3  million.
Adjustments  to  earnings   reported  in  2003  and  2002  were  not
significant.

(d)   Product inventories
</P>
<P>
A new standard on Generally  Accepted  Accounting  Principles (GAAP)
defines what  constitutes  Canadian GAAP and  establishes a relative
hierarchy for sources of GAAP. The CICA Handbook is confirmed as the
primary  source of Canadian  GAAP while  secondary  sources  include
International Accounting Standards and US GAAP. Industry practice is
no  longer  considered  a valid  source of GAAP.  As a  result,  the
company  has  amended  its  inventory  valuation  policy to  include
depreciation  and  amortization  charges  in the cost of  inventory.
Previously  amortization and  depreciation  were charged directly to
earnings  based on sales  volumes.  The new  policy  does not affect
reported  earnings  in any  prior  year  but  does  affect  reported
inventory and property, plant and equipment values. As a result, the
company  increased the reported  value of inventory by $9 million at
January 1, 2004, and reduced fixed assets by the same amount.

$47 million).  The company recorded an after-tax gain of $12 million
on the transaction.
</P>
<P>
The  agreement for sale also provides that in each of the years from
2005 to 2009 inclusive,  additional consideration may be paid to the
company  of  approximately  US$365,000  for  each  US$0.01  that the
average  annual  price  of  zinc  exceeds  US$0.454  per  pound.  In
addition,  should the acquirer,  Votorantim Metais, proceed with the
expansion of the refinery during the first three years following the
sale,  additional  consideration will be paid of US$12.75 million in
year one, declining to US$4.25 million in year three.

</P>
<P>
(c)   Investment in Elk Valley Coal  Partnership and Fording Canadian Coal
Trust
</P>
<P>
On February  28,  2003,  the company  completed a  transaction  with
Fording Inc.  (Fording),  Westshore  Terminals Income Fund, Sherritt
International  Corporation  and the Ontario  Teachers  Pension  Plan
Board to combine the  metallurgical  coal assets of Fording,  Luscar
Energy  Partnership  and the company.  The company  contributed  its
Elkview  mine,  with a net  book  value  of $167  million,  and $125
million in cash to obtain an initial 35%  interest in the  resulting
Elk Valley Coal  Partnership  (Elk Valley Coal).  Under the terms of
the  Partnership  Agreement,  Teck Cominco Limited is the manager of
Elk Valley  Coal.  The  company  also paid $150  million  for a 9.1%
interest in the Fording Canadian Coal Trust (FCCT), which was formed
by the reorganization of Fording into an income trust. FCCT owns the
remainder of Elk Valley Coal and other assets.  The company accounts
for its  direct  interest  in Elk Valley  Coal on the  proportionate
consolidation  basis. The company's  interest in FCCT is included in
investments  and is  recorded  at cost plus the  company's  share of
earnings of the trust less cash distributions.

On formation of Elk Valley Coal the net assets were  assigned  costs
based on their fair values as follows:

4.    ACQUISITIONS AND DISPOSITIONS, continued
</P>
<P>
Under the terms of the Partnership  Agreement,  Teck Cominco Limited
could  increase  its  interest in Elk Valley Coal by up to 5% if Elk
Valley Coal achieved certain specified  synergies by March 31, 2007.
Following the issue of the opinion of the independent expert engaged
to assess the  synergies  of Elk Valley Coal for the coal year ended
March 31, 2004,  the company and Fording  reached  agreement in July
2004 on the synergies realized and the resulting  adjustments to Elk
Valley Coal interests.
</P>
<P>
Teck  Cominco's 35% interest was increased by 3% effective  April 1,
2004, and will be increased by an additional 1% on April 1, 2005 and
on April 1, 2006,  bringing Teck Cominco's  total direct interest in
Elk Valley  Coal to 40% on April 1, 2006.  Including  the  company's
holding  of 4.3  million  units or 8.8%  interest  in the FCCT,  the
company's direct and indirect  interest in Elk Valley Coal was 43.4%
effective April 1, 2004.
</P>
<P>
The  company  has  treated  the  additional  interest as part of the
initial consideration for the assets contributed on the formation of
Elk  Valley  Coal and  accordingly  no gain has been  recorded.  The
company has adjusted its balance sheet to reflect the  additional 3%
share of the assets and  liabilities of Elk Valley Coal and included
its  additional  share of revenue,  expenses and cash flow effective
April 1, 2004.
</P>
<P>
(d)   Consolidation of Antamina
</P>
<P>
The company owns a 22.5%  interest in the Antamina  mine in Peru. On
July 31, 2003 the mine  achieved  completion  and the  project  debt
became  non-recourse  to  the  shareholders  of  the  project.  This
resulted  in the  removal  of  certain  voting  restrictions  on the
company with respect to the  management of the mine, and the company
began to  proportionately  consolidate  its  investment in Antamina.
Prior to July 31, 2003 the  company's  investment  in  Antamina  was
equity-accounted.
</P>
<P>
Values  were  assigned  to the net assets of Antamina at the date of
commencement of proportionate consolidation as follows:

(e)   Disposition of Los Filos Property
</P>
<P>
In October 2003,  the company sold its 70% interest in the Los Filos
gold  property in Mexico to Wheaton  River  Minerals  Ltd.  for cash
proceeds of $64 million (US$48  million) before current taxes of $15
million.  The company  recorded a gain on disposition of $58 million
(US$43 million) before provision for income tax of $17 million.
</P>
<P>
(f)   Acquisition of Lennard Shelf Zinc Mines
</P>
<P>
In November  2003,  the  company  acquired  the mineral  properties,
plant,  equipment and infrastructure of the Lennard Shelf zinc mines
in Western  Australia for $26 million.  The mines had been shut down
and  placed on care and  maintenance  prior to the  acquisition.  In
April 2004, the company  entered into an agreement  whereby  Noranda
Inc.  acquired  a 50%  joint  venture  interest  in  these  mines by
agreeing to fund  maintenance  and exploration  expenditures  for an
amount equal to the company's initial investment.

agreements of Antamina and the common shares and  subordinated  debt
of Antamina  held by the  company  are  pledged as security  for the
senior  debt.  The  interest  rates on the senior  debt are based on
LIBOR plus a variable  spread.  At December  31,  2004,  the average
interest rate on senior debt was 5.68% (2003 - 4.69%). The repayment
terms of the principal  amount of the various senior debt facilities
vary from 6.5 to 10.5 years from the first  repayment date which was
September  2002,  with  minimum  semi-annual   repayments  of  US$16
million.  Certain  conditions must be met prior to  distributions by
Antamina  to   shareholders   including  the   requirement  to  make
prepayments on the senior debt. In addition,  Antamina must maintain
cash  balances  for the benefit and  interest of the senior  lenders
which may only be used to make  principal  payments.  The  company's
share of these balances totalled $28 million at December 31, 2004.
</P>
<P>
Following Antamina achieving completion on July 31, 2003, the senior
project   debt  became   non-recourse   to  the  company  and  other
shareholders of Antamina.
</P>
<P>
(b)   On  October  12,  2004,  the  company  issued  7.3  million  Class B
Subordinate  Voting Shares on conversion  of US$156  million  stated
amount at maturity of its  convertible  subordinated  debentures due
2006,  which was called  for  redemption.  Debentures  with a stated
amount of maturity of US$13.8 million were redeemed for cash.
</P>
<P>
(c)   The company sold its interest in  Cajamarquilla in December 2004 and
the project debt was repaid.
</P>
<P>
(d)   The Elk Valley Coal Partnership has a $120 million  revolving credit
facility for working  capital  purposes,  of which the company's 38%
share is $46  million.  At December  31,  2004,  Elk Valley Coal had
issued  outstanding  letters of credit and guarantees  totalling $71
million.
</P>
<P>
The Highland  Valley  Copper  Partnership  (HVC) has a US$20 million
demand revolving facility for working capital purposes.  At December
31, 2004, HVC had issued letters of credit for $10 million.
</P>
<P>
(e)   At December 31, 2004,  the company had revolving  credit  facilities
aggregating  $768  million.  The amount of the  company's  revolving
credit facilities  becoming due is $81 million in 2005, $612 million
in 2007,  $25 million in 2008 and $50  million in 2009.  The company
has issued $113 million of letters of credit with the unused portion
of the credit facility  amounting to $655 million as at December 31,
2004.
</P>
<P>
(f)   Scheduled repayments on long-term debt are $38 million in 2005, $219
million in 2006,  $38  million  in 2007,  $38  million in 2008,  $38
million in 2009 and $294 million thereafter.  The current portion of
long-term debt of $38 million  (US$32  million) is in respect of the
Antamina senior debt financing.

<P>
The asset retirement obligations have been recorded as a liability at fair
value,  assuming a credit adjusted risk-free discount rate of 5.75% and an
inflation factor of 2.75%. The liability for retirement and remediation on
an undiscounted  basis before an inflation factor of 2.75% is estimated to
be  approximately  $335 million.  In addition,  for ongoing  treatment and
monitoring of the sites,  the estimated  undiscounted  payments in current
dollars before inflation adjustment are $2 million per annum for 2005-2030
and $8  million  per annum for  2031-2104.  Due to the  nature of  closure
plans, cash  expenditures are expected to occur over a significant  period
of time,  being from one year for plans  which are  already in progress to
over 100 years for the longest plan.
</P>
<P>
The change in cash flow estimates included $15 million in 2004 relating to
closed properties asset retirement  obligations which have been recognized
in other expense (note 14).

11.   PENSION AND OTHER EMPLOYEE FUTURE BENEFITS
</P>
<P>
The company has defined contribution pension plans for some employees. The
company's  share of contribution to these plans is expensed in the year it
is earned by the employee.
</P>
<P>
The company also has various  defined  benefit  pension plans that provide
benefits based principally on employees' years of service. These plans are
only   eligible   to   certain   qualifying   employees.   The  plans  are
'flat-benefit'  or  'final-pay'  plans  which  are  not  indexed.   Annual
contributions to these plans are actuarially  determined and made at or in
excess of minimum requirements prescribed by legislation.
</P>
<P>
The company has several  post-retirement  plans,  which generally  provide
post-retirement  medical and life insurance benefits to certain qualifying
employees.
</P>
<P>
All pension  plans are  actuarially  evaluated  for funding  purposes on a
three-year cycle. The most significant plan, which accounts for 62% of the
accrued  benefit  obligation  at December 31, 2004,  was last  actuarially
evaluated on December 31, 2001.  The actuarial  valuation for December 31,
2004  will  be  submitted  to  pension  regulators  by  August  2005.  The
measurement  date  used  to  determine  substantially  all of the  accrued
benefit  obligation  and  plan  assets  for  determination  of  accounting
information was December 31, 2004.

In September 1996, the company issued $248 million of 3% exchangeable
debentures due September 30, 2021.  Each $1,000  principal  amount of
the  exchangeable  debentures  is  exchangeable  at the option of the
holder  for  20.7254  common  shares  of  Inco  Limited  (subject  to
adjustment  if  certain  events  occur),  without  payment of accrued
interest.  The company may satisfy the exchange  obligation by a cash
payment  determined  with reference to the market value of the common
shares at the time of the exchange.
</P>
<P>
The  exchangeable  debentures  are  redeemable  at the  option of the
company on or after  September 12, 2006.  Redemption may be satisfied
by  delivery  of the Inco  common  shares  owned by the  company,  or
payment of a cash amount equal to the market value of the Inco common
shares at the time of redemption.
</P>
<P>
The Inco common shares (note 5) held by the company have been pledged
as  security  for the  exchangeable  debentures  and the  company has
designated the exchangeable  debentures as a hedge against these Inco
common shares. The Inco exchangeable  debenture is accounted for as a
cash flow hedge of the  anticipated  disposition  of the Inco  shares
held by the company.  The deferred  gain or loss on the  exchangeable
debenture will be recognized  against the corresponding  gain or loss
on disposition of the Inco common shares.

At December 31, 2004 there were 378,022  Class B  Subordinate  Voting
Shares  (2003 - 378,878  shares)  reserved for issuance to the former
shareholders of predecessor companies that merged with the company in
prior years.
</P>
<P>
(c) Exchangeable debentures due 2024
</P>
<P>
In April 1999 the company  issued $150 million of 25-year  debentures
with each $1,000  debenture  exchangeable,  at a  reference  price of
$23.50 per share,  into 42.5532 shares of Cominco Ltd. At the time of
the merger with  Cominco  Ltd. in 2001,  holders of these  debentures
were paid $6 in respect of each underlying Cominco share as a partial
repayment.  The face value of each  $1,000  debenture  was reduced to
$745  and each  debenture  became  convertible  into  76.596  Class B
Subordinate  Voting Shares for a total,  if exchanged,  of 11,489,000
Class B  Subordinate  Voting  Shares.  Interest  is at 2%  above  the
company's  dividend  yield using a share price of $9.72.  In 2004 and
2003,  the effective  interest rate so determined was 4.40% and 4.06%
respectively.
</P>
<P>
The  debentures are  exchangeable  by the holder or redeemable by the
company at any time. If redeemed by the company, the company will pay
a premium over the market value of the underlying Class B Subordinate
Voting  Share which was $37 per $1,000  principal  amount at December
31, 2004,  $19 from May 1, 2005 and  declining to nil after April 30,
2006.

13.  SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY, continued
</P>
<P>
By virtue of the company's  option to deliver a fixed number of Class
B Subordinate  Voting Shares to satisfy the principal  payments,  the
debentures net of issue costs and taxes are classified as a component
of  shareholders'  equity.  The  interest,  net of taxes,  is charged
directly to retained earnings.
</P>
<P>
(d) Preference shares
</P>
<P>
In November  2003,  the  Articles of the company were amended and the
company  issued  790,000  Series 1 and  550,000  Series 2  preference
shares to  replace  certain  preference  shares  of its  wholly-owned
subsidiary,  TCML (formerly  Cominco Ltd.).  These shares entitle the
holders to receive  dividends  and  redemptions  based upon a rate of
return index  governed by world prices for lead and silver.  The rate
of return index to date has been insufficient to trigger any dividend
or  redemption.  Based on  foreseeable  metal prices these shares are
expected  to  expire  in  March  2006   without  any   dividends   or
redemptions.  Accordingly, the company has assigned no value to these
shares.
</P>
<P>
(e) Share options
</P>
<P>
In the year ended  December 31,  2004,  the company  granted  836,000
Class B Subordinate Voting Share options at market price to employees
and an executive director. These share options have an exercise price
of $25.09, a vesting period of three years and expire in 2010.
</P>
<P>
The company recorded a stock-based compensation expense of $4 million
(2003 - $3 million, 2002 - $5 million) relating to share options.
</P>
<P>
The weighted  average fair value of Class B Subordinate  Voting Share
options was estimated as $9.74 per share option (2003 - $2.52) at the
grant date based on the Black-Scholes  option-pricing model using the
following assumptions:

(f) Deferred Share Units and Restricted Share Units
</P>
<P>
In April 2004, the company  approved a new  stock-based  compensation
plan for directors  and the six most senior  officers of the company.
Under the plan,  directors  and senior  officers  may receive  either
Deferred Share Units (DSU's) or Restricted Share Units (RSU's),  each
of which  entitle  the holder to a cash  payment  equal to the market
value of a Class B  Subordinate  Voting  Share of the  company at the
time they are redeemed.  In the case of  directors,  these units vest
immediately.  The units  granted to officers  vest after three years,
except in  circumstances  related  to  termination  without  cause or
retirement. DSU's may only be redeemed at the time a holder ceases to
be an officer or director  while RSU's must be redeemed  prior to the
end of a  three-year  period  measured  from  the  end  of  the  year
immediately preceding the grant.
</P>
<P>
Accounting standards for stock-based compensation require the company
to record,  over the  vesting  period,  an expense  equal to the fair
value of the units at the date of the grant.  In  addition,  as these
units  represent  a cash  liability  to the  company,  the expense is
adjusted  throughout  the life of the unit to  reflect  the  changing
value of the  liability  resulting  from market  fluctuations  in the
value of the underlying Class B Subordinate Voting Shares.
</P>
<P>
In April 2004,  the company  issued  39,000 DSU's and 22,500 RSU's to
directors  and 55,500  DSU's to  officers.  As a result,  the company
recorded  an  expense  of $3  million  in the year in  respect of the
initial grant and subsequent appreciation of the units.
</P>
<P>
(g) Warrants
</P>
<P>
In May 2004, the company received $90 million for the exercise of the
4,980,000  remaining  warrants to purchase Class B Subordinate Voting
Shares at a price of $18 per share. The warrants were issued in 1999.
</P>
<P>
(h) Cumulative Translation Adjustment
</P>
<P>
The cumulative  translation  adjustment represents the net unrealized
foreign  exchange  gains or losses on  translation of the accounts of
self-sustaining foreign subsidiaries,  net of foreign exchange losses
on the portion of US dollar  denominated  debt  designated  as hedges
against these investments.

<P>
(a)   In addition to the above hedging commitments, the company has
forward purchase commitments on 75 million pounds of zinc averaging
US$0.46 per pound maturing in 2005 to 2006 and 9 million pounds of
lead averaging US$0.33 per pound maturing 2005 to match fixed price
sales commitments to customers. A portion of these forward positions
do not qualify for hedge accounting and accordingly the company has
recognized a $4 million mark to market gain before taxes as a
result.
</P>
<P>
(b)   Included in the US dollar forward sales contract of $470 million is
the company's share of forward sales contracts by the Elk Valley
Coal Partnership of US$171 million.
</P>
<P>
(c)   The company is unable to apply hedge accounting to the copper
forward sales contracts and accordingly has recognized an unrealized
loss of $9 million before taxes.

Lake Roosevelt
</SPAN>
</P>
<P>
On November 11,  2004,  the  District  Court for Eastern  Washington
State denied a motion by Teck Cominco Metals Ltd. (TCML) to dismiss,
for want of jurisdiction, a citizen's suit brought by two members of
the  Colville   Confederated   Tribes  supported  by  the  State  of
Washington.  TCML has  petitioned  for appeal of the decision to the
9th Circuit Court of Appeal.
</P>
<P>
The Colville suit was brought  pursuant to Section  310(a)(i) of the
US Superfund Statute (CERCLA) to enforce a universal  administrative
order  issued  by  the  US  Environmental  Protection  Agency  (EPA)
purporting to require TCML to conduct a remedial  investigation  and
feasibility  study  with  respect  to  metal  contamination  in  the
sediments of the Upper  Columbia River and Lake  Roosevelt.  The EPA
issued the order shortly after  breaking off  negotiations  with the
company   during  which  TCML  offered  to  fund  human  health  and
ecological  studies,  at an  estimated  cost of  US$13  million,  to
address the possible impact of historical  discharges from the Trail
Metallurgical Operations in British Columbia. Both the Government of
Canada  and the  company  have the  view  that the EPA does not have
jurisdiction to apply U.S. law in Canada.
</P>
<P>
The Government of Canada and the Government of the US are continuing
to pursue a  bilateral  agreement  to  facilitate  the  studies  and
appropriate  remediation to address environmental concerns about the
area.  Such an  agreement  could  provide a basis under which TCML's
offer of funding for this work could be implemented.
</P>
<P>
There can be no  assurance  that the offer to fund the studies  will
resolve the matter, or that TCML or its affiliates will not be faced
with liability in relation to this matter. Until studies of the kind
described  above are  completed,  it is not possible to estimate the
extent and cost, if any, of remediation that may be required.

<SPAN STYLE="font-weight: bold">
Competition Investigation
</SPAN>
</P>
<P>
Teck Cominco Metals Ltd., as the marketing agent for Highland Valley
Copper  Partnership (HVC), has responded to an Order issued pursuant
to  the  Competition  Act  to  produce  documents  relevant  to  the
marketing of custom  copper  concentrates.  The company  understands
that  this  is  part  of  an  ongoing  industry-wide   investigation
involving major copper  concentrate  producers  commenced in Canada,
the US and Europe to determine whether there is evidence of a cartel
agreement and related illegal practices concerning pricing, customer
allocation and market sharing in the copper concentrate sector.
</P>
<P>
The  company has been  advised by the United  States  Department  of
Justice that it intends to close its investigation.  There can be no
assurance  that  the  investigation   will  not  result  in  further
regulatory  action against the company or HVC in Canada or elsewhere
or that HVC or the company  will not face  prosecution  or liability
under  the Act  otherwise  in  relation  to the  investigation.  The
company can also offer no guidance or  assurance as to the course of
the ongoing  investigation or when the ongoing investigation will be
completed.   The   company   is   cooperating   in  the   continuing
investigation.

Tax recovery
</P>
<P>
The company  has  appealed  the  assessment  of mining  taxes by the
Province of Ontario on gold hedging gains at the Williams mine. In a
similar case,  the Supreme Court of Ontario has recently  ruled that
gold  hedging  gains are  exempt  from  Ontario  mining  taxes.  The
Province  of Ontario  has sought  leave to appeal this ruling to the
Supreme  Court of Canada.  The company is  currently  assessing  the
effect of this court ruling and has not recorded any recovery of the
disputed   amounts  pending  possible  appeal  and  the  results  of
discussions with the Province of Ontario. The amount of mining taxes
and interest which may be recovered is approximately $16 million.

Pension Lawsuit

In May 2004, the Supreme Court of Canada denied the application of a
pensioner  group  for  leave to  appeal a  decision  of the  British
Columbia  Court of Appeal  affirming a decision of the B.C.  Supreme
Court in favour of the former  Cominco  Ltd.  (now  TCML).  The case
involved  the  transfer of funds from one of the  company's  pension

Red Dog Commitments
</SPAN>
</P>
<P>
Teck Cominco Alaska Inc. (TCAK), a subsidiary company, has a royalty
agreement  with NANA Regional  Corporation  (NANA) on whose land the
Red Dog mine is  situated.  Under the terms of the  agreement,  NANA
receives an annual net smelter  return  royalty equal to the greater
of 4.5% of Red Dog's net smelter return or US$1 million.  After TCAK
recovers certain capital  expenditures  including an interest factor
and all advance  royalties,  the royalty will be 25% of net proceeds
of  production  from the Red Dog mine  increasing  in 5%  increments
every fifth year to a maximum of 50%.
</P>
<P>
TCAK  leases  road and port  facilities  from the Alaska  Industrial
Development  and  Export  Authority  through  which it ships all ore
concentrate produced at the Red Dog mine. The lease requires TCAK to
pay a minimum annual user fee of US$18 million,  with fee escalation
provisions based on zinc price and annual tonnage.
</P>
<P>
TCAK has also entered into  agreements  for the  transportation  and
handling of concentrates  from the millsite.  These  agreements have
varying  terms  expiring at various  dates  through 2010 and include
provisions for extensions.  There are minimum  tonnage  requirements
and the annual  fees  amount to  approximately  US$9  million,  with
adjustment provisions based on variable cost factors.

recovery of capital  costs and an interest  factor on  approximately
60% of project costs.

20.   GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES IN CANADA AND THE UNITED STATES,
continued
</P>
<P>
(a)   Coal Inventory Valuation at Bullmoose Mine
</P>
<P>
Under Canadian GAAP,  production  inventories may be recorded at net
realizable value as there were long-term contracts for sale. US GAAP
requires  such  inventory to be valued at the lower cost and market.
The Bullmoose mine was closed during 2003.
</P>
<P>
(b)   Exchangeable Debentures due 2024 and Convertible Debentures
</P>
<P>
Under Canadian GAAP a portion of the  convertible  debentures  which
were  settled in full  during  2004 was  classified  as equity.  The
difference  between the carrying  amount of the  debentures  and the
contractual  liability  was  amortized to earnings.  Similarly,  the
exchangeable debentures due 2024 have been classified as equity with
related interest being charged directly to retained earnings.  Under
US GAAP both  debentures  would be  classified  as  liabilities  and
interest would be charged against current period earnings.
</P>
<P>
(c)   Share of Earnings  (Losses) in Antamina  and Fording  Canadian  Coal
Trust (FCCT)
</P>
<P>
Adjustments  in  respect  of the  company's  share  of  earnings  in
Antamina  and FCCT arise due to various  differences  between US and
Canadian GAAP. Prior to June 30, 2003, the company  equity-accounted
its  interest  in  Antamina.  The company  began to  proportionately
consolidate its investment in Antamina on July 1, 2003. As a result,
the company's  share of US GAAP  reconciling  items for Antamina are
separately  included in the related  adjustments  beginning  July 1,
2003.
</P>
<P>
(d)   Unrealized Holding Gains (Losses) on Investments
</P>
<P>
For US GAAP purposes, certain of the company's marketable securities
are considered to be either available-for-sale securities or trading
securities.  Available-for-sale  securities  are  carried  at market
value with  unrealized  gains or losses  included  in  comprehensive
income until realized or an other than temporary decline occurs. The
company's  trading  securities  are  carried  at market  value  with
unrealized gains or losses included in net earnings.
</P>
<P>
(e)   Deferred Start-Up Costs
</P>
<P>
Under Canadian GAAP,  certain mine start-up costs are deferred until
the mine reaches  commercial  levels of production and are amortized
over  the  life of the  project.  Under US  GAAP,  these  costs  are
expensed as incurred.
</P>
<P>
(f)   Comprehensive Income
</P>
<P>
Under US GAAP,  comprehensive  income is recognized  and measured in
accordance  with  FASB  Statement  No.  130  (SFAS  130)  &quot;Reporting
Comprehensive Income&quot;.  Comprehensive income includes all changes in
equity other than those  resulting  from  investments  by owners and
distributions   to  owners.   Comprehensive   income   includes  two
components,  net income and other  comprehensive  income (OCI).  OCI
includes  amounts that are  recorded as an element of  shareholders'
equity but are  excluded  from net income as these  transactions  or
events were  attributable to changes from non-owner  sources.  These
items include minimum pension liability  adjustments,  holding gains
and  losses on  certain  investments,  gains and  losses on  certain
derivative instruments and foreign currency gains and losses related
to self-sustaining foreign operations.  Comprehensive income and OCI
are currently not a component of Canadian GAAP.

20.   GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES IN CANADA AND THE UNITED STATES,
continued
</P>
<P>
(g)   Derivative Instruments
</P>
<P>
Effective   January  1,  2004,   the  company   adopted   Accounting
Guideline-13,   &quot;Hedging   Relationships&quot;   for  Canadian  GAAP  and
designated  substantially  all derivative  positions as hedges (Note
18).
</P>
<P>
For US GAAP  purposes,  the company  adopted the  provisions of FASB
Statement No. 133 (SFAS 133),  &quot;Accounting for Derivative Instrument
and  Hedging  Activities&quot;,  effective  January  1,  2001.  SFAS  133
requires  that all  derivatives  be recorded on the balance sheet as
either assets or liabilities at their fair value. The accounting for
changes in the fair value of  derivatives  depends on whether it has
been designated and qualifies as part of a hedging relationship.
</P>
<P>
For fair value hedges,  the effective portion of the changes in fair
value of the  derivatives  is offset by changes in the fair value of
the hedged item.  For cash flow hedges the effective  portion of the
changes  in fair  value are  accumulated  in OCI and  released  into
income when the hedged item affects net earnings.
</P>
<P>
Under US GAAP, the company's Inco exchangeable debenture includes an
embedded derivative which must be separately recorded on the balance
sheet  at fair  value.  Changes  in the fair  value of the  embedded
derivative are included in net earnings.
</P>
<P>
In 2004 and 2003, certain instruments entered into by the Elk Valley
Coal  Partnership  were designated as cash flow hedges.  For US GAAP
purposes,  the company did not  designate any other  derivatives  as
hedges under SFAS 133 in the periods presented.
</P>
<P>
(h)   Asset Retirement Obligations
</P>
<P>
For US GAAP  purposes the company  adopted FASB  Statement  No. 143,
&quot;Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations&quot;,  effective January 1,
2003.  The  company  adopted  the  provisions  of CICA 3110,  &quot;Asset
Retirement  Obligations&quot;,   for  Canadian  GAAP  purposes  effective
January  1, 2004,  and  retroactively  restated  the  Canadian  GAAP
results to account for this policy change.
</P>
<P>
The Canadian and US standards for Asset  Retirement  Obligations are
substantially  the same;  however due to the  difference in adoption
dates, different assumptions were used. This resulted in differences
in the asset and  liability  balances on adoption and will result in
different amortization and accretion charges over time.
</P>
<P>
(i)   Stock-based Compensation
</P>
<P>
For US GAAP  purposes,  the company  adopted FASB  Statement No. 123
(SFAS  123),  &quot;Accounting  for  Stock-based  Compensation&quot;  and FASB
Statement   No.  148  (SFAS  148),   &quot;Accounting   for   Stock-based
Compensation-Transition   and  Disclosure,   an  amendment  of  FASB
Statement No. 123&quot;, effective January 1, 2004. SFAS 123 requires the
use  of  the  fair  value  method  of  accounting  for   stock-based
compensation.  The company  utilized the  provisions of SFAS 148 for
retroactive  statement  of net income and earnings per share for all
periods  presented.  These standards are consistent with the revised
provisions of CICA 3870, adopted for Canadian GAAP effective January
1,  2004  (Note  3).  As  the  company   adopted  with   retroactive
restatement of prior periods,  there will no longer be a Canadian to
US GAAP difference.
</P>
<P>
(j)   Additional Minimum Pension Liability
</P>
<P>
For US GAAP  purposes,  the  company is  required  to  recognize  an
additional  minimum pension liability in the amount of the excess of
the company's  unfunded  accrued  benefit  obligation  over the fair
value of the plan assets.  An intangible  asset is recorded equal to
any  unrecognized  past  service  costs.  Changes in the  additional
minimum pension liability and intangible asset are recorded in OCI.

20.   GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES IN CANADA AND THE UNITED STATES,
continued
</P>
<P>
(k)   Underground Development Amortization
</P>
<P>
Under  Canadian GAAP,  the company  retroactively  adopted the block
method of underground amortization, effective January 1, 2004, which
resulted in a $4 million  charge to opening  retained  earnings.  US
GAAP  requires  that such a change be accounted  for as a cumulative
adjustment through the current period income statement. Income under
US GAAP has been reduced by $4 million  after-tax during 2004 and no
difference  in ending  shareholder's  equity  exists  between US and
Canadian GAAP.
</P>
<P>
(l)   Capitalized Interest
</P>
<P>
For US GAAP purposes,  interest  costs must be  capitalized  for all
assets that are under  development.  For Canadian GAAP,  interest is
capitalized only on project specific debt.
</P>
<P>
(m)   Variable Interest Entities
</P>
<P>
For US GAAP purposes, the company adopted Interpretation No. 46 (FIN
46R) &quot;Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, an Interpretation
of Accounting  Research Bulletin No. 51&quot; effective January 2004. FIN
46R establishes  accounting  guidance for  consolidation of variable
interest  entities.  Adoption of this statement for US GAAP purposes
has not resulted in any effect to earnings or retained earnings.  In
Canada,  Accounting Guideline 15 &quot;Consolidation of Variable Interest
Entities&quot; will be adopted effective January 2005.
</P>
<P>
(n)   Recent U.S. Accounting Pronouncements
</P>
<P>
In November 2004, FASB issued Statement No. 151 (SFAS 151) Inventory
Costs which  clarifies the accounting  for abnormal  amounts of idle
facility expense,  freight, handling costs and wasted material. This
statement  requires that those items be recognized as current-period
charges and the  allocation  of fixed  production  overheads  to the
costs  of  conversion  be  based  on  the  normal  capacity  of  the
production facility.  This standard is effective for inventory costs
incurred during years beginning on or after June 15, 2005 and is not
expected to have a material impact on the company.
</P>
<P>
In December 2004, FASB issued Statement 123R (SFAS 123R) &quot;Accounting
for  Stock-based  Compensation&quot;.  As the company  adopted  SFAS 123R
during 2004, there is no material impact on the company.

21.   SEGMENTED INFORMATION
</P>
<P>
The  company  has six  reportable  segments:  zinc  smelters,  zinc mines,
copper,  gold,  coal,  and  corporate  and other.  The  corporate  segment
includes the company's investment, exploration and development activities.
Sales between  segments,  initially  recorded at arm's length prices,  are
eliminated in the Inter-Segment column.  Segments include operations based
upon the principal product produced.

Elk Valley Coal Partnership (43.4%)
</SPAN>
</P>
<P>
Elk Valley Coal operates six metallurgical coal mines. Five of the mines are in
southeastern British Columbia, and one is in western Alberta. Elk Valley Coal is
the second largest seaborne exporter of metallurgical coal in the world, with
annual production capacity expected to reach 28 million tonnes in 2005.
</P>
<P>
The Elk Valley Coal Partnership was formed in March 2003, with Teck Cominco
initially owning 35% and Fording Canadian Coal Trust 65%. Under the terms of the
Partnership Agreement, Teck Cominco could increase its interest by up to 5% if
the Partnership achieved certain specified synergies by March 31, 2007.
Following the issue of the opinion of the independent expert engaged to assess
the synergies of Elk Valley Coal for the coal year ended March 31, 2004, the
company and Fording Canadian Coal Trust, which owns the balance of the
partnership interest, reached agreement in July 2004 on the synergies realized
and the resulting adjustments to partnership interests. Teck Cominco's 35%
interest was increased by 3% effective April 1, 2004, and will be increased by
an additional 1% on April 1, 2005 and on April 1, 2006, bringing Teck Cominco's
total direct interest in Elk Valley Coal to 40%. Including the company's holding
of 4.3 million units, or 8.8% interest in the Fording Canadian Coal Trust, the
company's direct and indirect interest in Elk Valley Coal was 43.4% effective
April 1, 2004.
</P>
<P>
The expectation of continued strong coal markets led to a decision in March to
proceed with development of the Cheviot Creek pit which is located about 20
kilometres south of the Cardinal River coal plant. The capital cost of the
project is estimated at $120 million. This entails building a 20 kilometre haul
road, developing the Cheviot Creek pit, refurbishing the coal plant, upgrading
and purchasing additional pit equipment. Clean coal production from Cheviot
Creek began in October 2004 and the planned 2.8 million tonnes per year rate is
expected to be achieved in the third quarter of 2005.
</P>
<P>
A number of environmental organizations have applied to the Federal Court
challenging certain federal authorizations that the project has received and
seeking a further environmental assessment of the project. The Federal Court is
expected to hear the applications in June 2005. In addition, an individual
appealed certain provincial approvals in connection with the project. The
Environmental Appeal Board heard the appeal in mid-January 2005 and the parties
are awaiting a decision.
</P>
<P>
Plant expansion commenced in the fourth quarter to expand the Fording River
operation from an annual rate of 9.5 to 10.5 million tonnes. This will require
new equipment and some de-bottlenecking in the coal plant. A new large electric
cable shovel, which was purchased earlier in the year to replace smaller
shovels, will ensure that excavator capacity is available for the increased
production rate. The mine is expected to reach the higher production rate during
the third quarter of 2005.
</P>
<P>
Production at the Elkview mine will be increased from the current 6.0 million
tonne level to 7.0 million tonnes by 2007. The expansion is supported by two of
the world's largest steel producers, Nippon Steel of Japan and POSCO of Korea.
Both steel producers propose to gradually increase their individual coal
purchases from Elk Valley Coal to an aggregate of 6.25 million tonnes per year
under a ten-year sales contract. Further, Nippon and POSCO would each pay US$25
million to acquire a 2.5% equity interest in the Elkview mine. The proceeds will
pay for the additional equipment required for the expansion.
</P>
<P>
Coal sales by Elk Valley Coal totalled 25 million tonnes in 2004. Teck Cominco's
share of the operating profit totalled $125 million compared with $73 million
from coal operations in 2003. The increase was due mainly to a higher realized
coal price, partially offset by the weaker U.S. dollar and higher transportation
costs, as well as the increased ownership interest in Elk Valley Coal commencing
April 1, 2004.

<P>
Substantially all of the hard coking coal sales for the 2005 coal year beginning
April 1, 2005 have been contracted at an average price of US$125 per tonne on an
FOB west coast port equivalent basis. The expansions noted above should see Elk
Valley Coal increase its annual production from the 2004 level of 25 million
tonnes to 28 million tonnes in 2005 and ultimately to 30 million tonnes by 2007.
The rail rates being charged by CP Rail for the coal being moved from the five
B.C. mines to west coast ports are the subject of various legal proceedings. The
parties are in discussions aimed at settling the dispute. Regardless of the

<P>
Red Dog (100%)
</P>
<P>
The Red Dog mine in northwest Alaska is the largest zinc mine in the world and
is operated by Teck Cominco under an agreement with NANA Regional Corporation,
Inc., an Alaskan Native corporation.
</P>
<P>
The mine produced 554,000 tonnes of zinc and 117,000 tonnes of lead in
concentrates in 2004, slightly less than in 2003 because excessive process pipe
scaling during the first quarter restricted throughput.
</P>
<P>
The mine continued to focus on improving operational efficiency. Recommendations
from an energy audit were implemented in the year and electricity consumption
was reduced by about 5% at the mine and 30% at the port. Concentrator process
enhancements included the installation of a more advanced air dispersion system
on zinc flotation columns, &quot;expert system&quot; control equipment on the grinding and
flotation circuits and cameras to control flotation reagent additions. The
Environmental Management System was certified compliant with the ISO 14001
standard.
</P>
<P>
Operating profit increased to $207 million from $42 million in 2003 primarily
due to higher prices for zinc and lead, higher zinc sales volumes, as well as
more favourable smelter base treatment charges.
</P>
<P>
Production in 2005 is estimated to be 578,000 tonnes of zinc and 105,000 tonnes
of lead in concentrates. Site operating costs are expected to increase slightly
due mainly to higher energy costs partially offset by energy reduction
initiatives.
</P>
<P>
Capital expenditures planned for 2005 include $6 million for mobile equipment
and $14 million on infrastructure.

Highland Valley Copper (97.5%)
</SPAN>
</P>
<P>
Teck Cominco purchased an additional 33.6% interest in the Highland Valley
Copper mine in the first quarter, increasing its interest from 63.9% to 97.5%.
The mine, located southwest of Kamloops, British Columbia, is among the world's
largest-tonnage copper mining and milling operations.
</P>
<P>
The mill achieved record throughput of 51 million tonnes in 2004 or 138,300
tonnes per day. Copper production totalled 375 million pounds despite a copper
ore grade of 0.38% copper, the lowest ever since commencement of production.
Higher grade molybdenum and modifications to the molybdenum separation circuit,
which improved the recovery rate from 75% to over 90%, resulted in a record 10.7
million pounds of production in the year.
</P>
<P>
The mine achieved its best-ever annual safety record. The improvement in safety
performance was reflected in a record low disability injury frequency of 0.5 and
a severity of 4.6 for every 200,000 hours worked, compared with a 19 year
average of 1.4 and 27.0 respectively.
</P>
<P>
A new three-year collective agreement, which expired on September 30, 2003, was
concluded with the United Steel Workers of America in early 2004.
</P>
<P>
Highland Valley generated a record operating profit of $431 million, far
exceeding the 2003 operating profit of $56 million. This was a result of
significantly higher copper prices, record molybdenum production and
exceptionally high molybdenum prices which averaged US$19 per pound.
</P>
<P>
Production in 2005 is projected to be 409 million pounds of copper, or 34
million pounds more than in 2004 because of a higher head grade. Molybdenum
production is expected to decrease to 5.0 million pounds due to a lower head
grade.
</P>
<P>
Capital expenditures for 2005 are planned at $22 million, including the purchase
of five new 240-tonne haulage trucks and mine support and service equipment.
</P>
<P>
A new mine plan is being developed that would involve expanding the Valley pit
to the east and salvaging ore from the west wall of the Lornex pit. These
extensions are dependent on finding solutions to some challenging pit wall
stability concerns. The price of copper will also be a factor. A final decision
will be made before the end of 2006, and if it is positive, mine life would be
extended by four years to 2013.

Located in the north central Peruvian Andes near Huaraz, the Antamina mine and
the port facilities at Huarmey is a joint venture between Teck Cominco (22.5%),
BHP Billiton (33.75%), Noranda (33.75%) and Mitsubishi (10%).
</P>
<P>
Increases in productivity were achieved as a result of a comprehensive employee
training program, as the employees gained operating experience at a relatively
new mine. The number of expatriates has declined from 66 to 28 and further
reductions are expected.
</P>
<P>
Sediment removal from the pit was completed in early May, releasing large
tonnages of copper-only ore with favourable milling characteristics which
resulted in increased throughput and recovery rates. Mill throughput in 2004
averaged a record 85,000 tonnes per day, compared with 72,000 in 2003. The mine
produced a record 798 million pounds of copper in concentrate as well as 419
million pounds of zinc in concentrate in 2004.
</P>
<P>
The company's share of operating profits of $184 million in 2004 increased
significantly from the previous year due mainly to higher copper production and
higher copper prices, partially offset by lower zinc production. Antamina's
operating results were consolidated commencing July 2003 and equity-accounted
prior to that date.
</P>
<P>
A program of infill drilling and analysis to facilitate better short and
long-term mine planning and to enhance the accuracy of the current reserve model

preliminary evaluation of the results supports previous resource estimates. The
results of the drilling program will be incorporated into a new reserve model to
be completed by mid 2005.

<P>
Production of copper and zinc in 2005 will be similar to 2004 levels while
molybdenum production is expected to increase with higher grades and recoveries.

</P>
<P>
Teck Cominco and Barrick Gold Corporation jointly own and operate the Williams
and David Bell gold mines located in the Hemlo area of northern Ontario.
</P>
<P>
The Williams mill, which processes ore from the David Bell and Williams
underground mines and the Williams open pit, achieved record throughput of
3,662,000 tonnes in 2004 or 10,005 tonnes per day. Gold production was lower
than the previous year due to declining ore grades.
</P>
<P>
Production tonnage from the Williams underground mine increased by 5%, but the
grade was substantially lower due to ground problems restricting access to high
grade areas. The paste backfill system installed in 2003 has provided production
flexibility and made it possible to mine the higher tonnage. A pushback in the
pit, started in the second quarter, enabled ore production at a rate similar to
that achieved in 2003, but at a lower grade.
</P>
<P>
Underground access to high grade stopes at the David Bell mine was also
restricted due to ground problems. A change to the lower-cost Alimak mining
method in certain areas of the mine and the installation of a paste backfill
plant in late 2004 is expected to help improve productivity.
</P>
<P>
The unionized workers at the David Bell mine accepted a new three-year contract,
effective October 31, 2004.
</P>
<P>
Operating profit of $32 million in 2004 was slightly higher than 2003 due to
higher U.S. dollar gold prices, largely offset by the impact of a weaker U.S.
dollar and lower gold production.
</P>
<P>
Hemlo gold production in 2005 is expected to be slightly below 2004 levels as
high grade areas of the Williams underground mine continue to be depleted.
Operating costs are expected to be similar to 2004, as rising energy and supply
costs will be offset by workforce reductions made over the last year.

<P>
Teck Cominco's metallurgical operations at Trail, B.C. constitute one of the
world's largest lead and zinc smelting and refining complexes. The fully
integrated process at Trail operations also produces a wide variety of specialty
metals and chemicals.
</P>
<P>
A strong focus on operating performance and productivity resulted in several
production records and generated significant returns in 2004. Refined zinc
production was 296,000 tonnes, which represents the best-ever year of refined
zinc production, exceeding the previous record of 288,000 tonnes set in 1999.
</P>
<P>
Refined lead production, at 84,300 tonnes, was impacted by a boiler explosion in
the Kivcet furnace in February and a subsequent fire in the lead refinery. The
furnace resumed operation in early March and since then has averaged throughput
of 1,356 tonnes per day with an on-line time of 93.8%, setting record
performance levels.
</P>
<P>
Other production milestones in 2004 include record production of silver, indium
and germanium, and record treatment of residues from historic stockpiles.
</P>
<P>
A four-week shutdown for the Kivcet lead smelter is scheduled in March 2005 to
allow for major maintenance and upgrades.
</P>
<P>
Operating profit from metals operations in 2004 improved by $100 million over
the previous year, due mainly to higher zinc and lead prices and increased
profitability from precious metals production and specialty metals operations.

Trail Power (100%)
</SPAN>
</P>
<P>
Teck Cominco owns the Waneta hydroelectric dam which was built in 1954, located
ten kilometres south of Trail close to the border with the United States. The
company also owns a 15-kilometre transmission line from Waneta to the United
States power distribution system. The Waneta dam is one of several hydroelectric
generating plants in the region. The operation of these plants is coordinated
through contractual arrangements under which Teck Cominco receives approximately
2,690 GW.h of power per year, regardless of water flow available for power
generation.
</P>
<P>
The year saw the continuation of a $41 million project to upgrade the remaining
three of the four generating units at the Waneta dam, which will result in an
increase in capacity from 400 MW to 475 MW. The upgrade for two of the three
units was completed in 2003 and design of the third unit commenced in 2004. The
current capacity of the Waneta dam is 450 MW. A three-year, $40 million
modernization of the company's inter-connection to the provincial transmission
grid was also completed in 2004. This project involved the replacement of two
major switching stations with a single new one and the replacement and reduction
of a number of transmission lines.
</P>
<P>
Operating profit of $37 million was significantly higher than the previous year
as a result of higher power prices, as well as sales volumes which were 24%
higher than 2003.
</P>
<P>
<SPAN STYLE="font-weight: bold">
DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
</SPAN>
</P>
<P>
<SPAN STYLE="font-weight: bold">
Pogo Project (40%)
</SPAN>
</P>
<P>
Teck Cominco holds a 40% interest in and is the manager of the Pogo gold
project. Subsidiaries of Sumitomo Metal Mining (51%) and Sumitomo Corp. (9%)
hold the remaining interests. The property is located in central Alaska, some 85
miles southeast of Fairbanks, and hosts a high grade gold deposit. Construction
of a 2,500-tonne per day underground mine and mill is well advanced.
</P>
<P>
In mid-March 2004, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) issued the key
remaining permit, the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System permit,
which regulates the discharge of water from the facility to the Goodpaster
River. An Alaskan environmental group filed an appeal with the EPA and this
necessitated the termination of construction activities. Negotiations with the
environmental group and the EPA were undertaken over the following weeks and the
appeal was subsequently withdrawn. The EPA then issued the permit on May 7, 2004
and construction resumed.
</P>
<P>
Construction activities were suspended for nine days in late June because of a
major forest fire. A 49 mile all-season access road was completed in September
and by year end the mill building was enclosed. This will allow construction
work to continue indoors during the harsh winter months. The underground mine
contractor started mobilization in December and is scheduled to complete about
12,000 feet of development work and installation of the underground ore conveyor
by the end of August in 2005. First gold production is expected in the first
quarter of 2006, and the mine should be operating at full capacity by the end of
the second quarter 2006, after a ramp-up period.
</P>
<P>
Construction cost, including escalation, owner's contingency and the effect of
construction delays, was originally estimated to be $298 million. It is now
estimated to be approximately $320 million, due to higher than expected fuel and
steel prices and equipment and field costs.

Commodities in General
</SPAN>
</P>
<P>
Improvement in demand and prices of all Teck Cominco products continued in 2004.
Realized prices of US$1.35 a pound for copper, US$19 a pound for molybdenum and
US$406 an ounce for gold were particularly strong, as were those for indium and
germanium from our Trail refinery, at US$625 and US$322 per kilogram
respectively. Zinc improved to US$0.48 a pound, and contracts for coal for the
coming year are at record prices.
</P>
<P>
As noted in last year's annual report, China has become a major factor in demand
for mineral commodities. Its consumption of copper has tripled and zinc has
quadrupled over the last ten years to 20% and 23% of global demand. Its growing
production of steel resulted in it becoming a significant importer of
metallurgical coal for the first time in 2004.
</P>
<P>
As the charts for copper and zinc illustrate, there was an increasing rate of
growth in global demand over the last ten years. With the intensity of use, or
consumption per capita, in both China and India still well below that of the
rest of the industrialized world, and with their large populations, there is
reason for optimism that the recent increase in global demand growth will be
sustainable.

Zinc
</SPAN>
</P>
<P>
Global zinc consumption grew by 6% in 2004. China and the United States both
increased by 11% over the previous year, Asia by 7% and Europe by only 1%.
</P>
<P>
Inventories of zinc on the London Metal Exchange (LME) fell by 111,000 tonnes or
15% during the year, despite deliveries of 263,000 tonnes of
previously-unreported stocks to the Exchange. Total refined inventories (LME,
Producer, Consumer and Merchant) fell to seven weeks of Western world
consumption at year end.
</P>
<P>
The LME price of zinc averaged US$0.48 a pound in 2004, increasing over the year
to US$0.53 a pound at year end.
</P>
<P>
China in 2004 has for the first time become a net importer of zinc as a result
of strong domestic consumption. The outlook for zinc price remains positive,
with world metal demand expected to continue to exceed supply.
</P>
<P>
<SPAN STYLE="font-weight: bold">
Copper
</SPAN>
</P>
<P>
Global copper consumption grew by 5.7% in 2004, with that in the United States
increasing by 7% after three years of decline. Asian consumption increased by
6.8%, China by an estimated 5% and Western Europe fell 1%.
</P>
<P>
Inventories of copper in the LME, COMEX and Shanghai warehouses fell by 684,000
tonnes in 2004, and stocks are now below what is considered to be a critical
level throughout the world.
</P>
<P>
The LME price of copper averaged US$1.30 a pound in 2004, increasing over the
year to US$1.45 a pound at year end.
</P>
<P>
The higher price has allowed the restart of much of the mine production that was
closed or cut back in prior years due to poor economics, and this added close to
one million tonnes to supply in 2004. The bottleneck in supply is now
insufficient smelter capacity which, combined with low inventories, is expected
to support copper prices in the near term.
</P>
<P>
<SPAN STYLE="font-weight: bold">
Coal
</SPAN>
</P>
<P>
Hard coking coal markets remained very tight through 2004 due to the ongoing
increased demand from the global steel industry. Contributing to a constrained
supply situation were Australian production problems and Elk Valley Coal's
weather-related shipping delays in the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
Over the past few years, China has reversed its position from a net exporter of
hard coking coal to a net importer, while at the same time China's exports of
coke to the steel industry have been subject to fluctuation. The global steel
industry has responded by planning significant additions to future domestic coke
production capacity to replace Chinese coke imports. This should increase global
seaborne demand for hard coking coal from producers such as Elk Valley Coal.
</P>
<P>
Price negotiations for the 2005 coal year (April 1, 2005 - March 31, 2006),
concluded at the end of 2004, reflected the tight market conditions.
Substantially all of Elk Valley Coal's hard coking coal settlements were
concluded at US$125/tonne FOB Roberts Bank terminal for the 2005 coal year.
After accounting for other lower quality product sales such as thermal and PCI
coal, and as some contracts are based on time periods other than the coal year,
the weighted average coal price for the 2005 coal year is expected to be
approximately US$122/tonne, up about 130% from 2004 coal year prices.
</P>
<P>
During the year, the trend strengthened towards steel producers signing
long-term contracts and/or purchasing equity interests in coal producers in
order to secure additional supplies to meet their future needs, for example Elk
Valley Coal's proposed sale of a 5% equity interest in the Elkview mine to
Nippon Steel and POSCO for US$50 million and new 10-year contracts.
</P>
<P>
The higher coal prices are serving to attract new supply to the market, with
major producers announcing plans for capacity increases. However, it is
uncertain when the metallurgical coal markets can be brought back into balance.

Gold
</SPAN>
</P>
<P>
London spot gold averaged US$409 an ounce in 2004, up from US$363 in 2003, and
was US$440 an ounce at year end.
</P>
<P>
The main factors in the increase were the continuing weakening of the U.S.
dollar and producer de-hedging, which is estimated to have risen by 50% in 2004
to over 400 tonnes. Mine production is estimated to have fallen by 4% or 110
tonnes, its largest decline since the 1940's.
</P>
<P>
Jewellery fabrication rose by 4% in 2004, with the largest increases in India,
Turkey and China, and demand from the electronics industry was up by 8%.
</P>
<P>
Investment in gold rose by 33% to 245 tonnes, driven in part by the Exchange
Traded Funds (ETF's) in the United States and elsewhere.

FINANCIAL REVIEW
</SPAN>
</P>
<P>
Net earnings for the year ended December 31, 2004 were $617 million, or $3.18
per share, compared with restated net earnings of $134 million or $0.71 per
share in 2003, and restated net earnings of $13 million or $0.06 per share in
2002.
</P>
<P>
Net earnings in 2004 included a $52 million after-tax loss from the writedown of
the investment in Sons of Gwalia, while net earnings in 2003 included an
after-tax gain of $41 million on the sale of the Los Filos gold property.
</P>
<P>
The significantly higher earnings in 2004 were due mainly to high commodity
prices, with prices of copper, zinc, lead, molybdenum, gold and coal all
surpassing the averages of the preceding two years. Partially offsetting the
effect of higher metal prices was a weaker U.S. dollar. The company's realized
Canadian/U.S. dollar exchange rate including hedging gains was 1.32, compared
with 1.45 in 2003 and 1.57 in 2002.
</P>
<P>
In addition to higher commodity prices in 2004, increased production of coal and
copper also contributed to the record earnings. The formation of the Elk Valley
Coal Partnership in early 2003 raised the company's direct share of coal
production from 6.9 million tonnes in 2002 to 7.6 million tonnes in 2003 and 9.3
million tonnes in 2004. Total copper production also increased as a result of
the company acquiring an additional 34% interest in Highland Valley Copper in
the first quarter, and the increased copper production from the company's 22.5%
interest in Antamina compared with the previous two years.
</P>
<P>
Cash flow from operations, before changes to non-cash working capital items, was
$1.1 billion compared with $314 million in 2003 and $185 million in 2002. The
increase in cash flow from operations in the last two years was due mainly to
rising commodity prices, partially offset by the effects of a weaker U.S.
dollar. The most significant increases came from copper and zinc operations,
with price increases for copper and zinc as well as by-products.
</P>
<P>
At December 31, the company had a cash balance of $907 million against debt of
$665 million. At the beginning of the year, the amount of debt net of cash was
$1.01 billion or 29% of net debt plus equity.

REVENUES
</SPAN>
</P>
<P>
Revenues are affected by sales volumes, commodity prices and currency exchange
rates. Comparative data for each operation on production and sales as well as
revenues and operating profits are presented in the tables on pages 28 and 29.
Realized commodity prices and Canadian/U.S. dollar exchange rates are presented
in the table on this page.
</P>
<P>
Revenues from operations were $3.4 billion compared with $2.2 billion in 2003
and $2.0 billion in 2002. Major revenue increases in 2004 over 2003 included
approximately $700 million from copper and molybdenum sales, $400 million from
zinc mining and refinery operations, and $100 million from coal operations. The
significant increase in revenues in 2004 was due mainly to higher commodity
prices. Other reasons for the increase were higher coal sales volumes, the
purchase of an additional 34% interest in Highland Valley Copper in the first
quarter of 2004 and the change-over from equity accounting to consolidation of
Antamina results on July 1, 2003.
</P>
<P>
The revenue increase of $186 million in 2003 over 2002 was due mainly to
increased revenues from copper and coal operations resulting from higher copper
prices and coal sales volumes.

COSTS AND EXPENSES
</SPAN>
</P>
<P>
General, administration and marketing expense was $68 million in 2004 compared
with $55 million in 2003 and $56 million in 2002. Major increases over 2003 were
stock-based compensation expense, recognized under the newly-adopted accounting
standard, and bonus expenses.
</P>
<P>
Interest expense of $61 million in 2004 was $4 million lower than the previous
year due mainly to decreasing debt balances in the year and the translation of
U.S.dollar interest expense at more favourable U.S. dollar exchange rates. The
interest expense of $65 million in 2003 was higher than $60 million in 2002 due
mainly to debt increases in the year, with the consolidation of $360 million of
the Antamina project debt on July 1, 2003 and the $250 million debt increase
upon the formation of Elk Valley Coal in the first quarter. The increased
interest expense from higher debt balances was largely offset by the effect of
lower interest rates, a more favourable U.S. dollar exchange rate, and gains
from interest rate swaps.
</P>
<P>
Exploration expense was $42 million in 2004, compared with $30 million in 2003
and $34 million in 2002. The higher exploration expense is a reflection of the
company's increased commitment to exploration. Some of the exploration successes
have resulted in major gains on disposition of mineral properties, such as the
gain on sale of the Los Filos gold property in 2003. Exploration expenditures in
2004 included $26 million or 62% of total expenditures on gold and copper
projects, $3 million on zinc, $8 million on nickel and poly-metallic projects
and $5 million on diamond projects. Of the total expenditures of $42 million,
approximately 24% was spent in Canada and 16% in Mexico, with the remaining
expenditures incurred mostly in Peru, Chile, Australia and the United States.
</P>
<P>
Other income of $24 million included income from the Fording Canadian Coal Trust
of $13 million, gain on sale of investments of $25 million and a number of
miscellaneous income items, offset by $26 million of asset retirement
obligations on closed properties and miscellaneous expenses.
</P>
<P>
Income taxes of $305 million represents a 34% composite tax rate for the
company's income from various jurisdictions. This composite tax rate is
significantly lower than the Canadian statutory tax rate of 42% due to the lower
tax rates applied on income earned in foreign jurisdictions. The composite tax
rate increased from 30% in 2003 to 34% in 2004 because a significantly larger
proportion of the company's income in 2004 was earned in Canada.

Operating Cash Flow
</SPAN>
</P>
<P>
Cash flow from operations before changes to non-cash working capital items was
$1.1 billion for 2004 compared with $314 million a year ago, mainly as a result
of higher prices for the company's main products. Other reasons for the
significantly higher operating cash flow were the acquisition of an additional
interest in Highland Valley Copper, higher coal sales volumes and the
consolidation of Antamina's results for a full year in 2004 compared with the
last six months in 2003. The operating cash flow of $314 million in 2003 was
higher than the $185 million in 2002 due mainly to rising copper and zinc prices
in the fourth quarter of 2003, and the consolidation of the Antamina results
commencing in the last six months of 2003.

<P>
Capital expenditures in 2004 amounted to $216 million, with $124 million of
sustaining capital expenditures and $92 million of development expenditures. The
company's share of development expenditures was $67 million on the Pogo gold
project and $25 million on the Cheviot Creek coal project. Total capital
expenditures in 2003 were $158 million including $45 million on the Pend Oreille
zinc project.

<P>
In 2004, the company issued 7.6 million Class B Subordinate Voting Shares for
$126 million, including $90 million on the exercise of 5.0 million share
purchase warrants and $36 million on the exercise of employees and directors
stock options.
</P>
<P>
Following a notice of redemption in September 2004, the company issued 7.3
million Class B Subordinate Voting Shares on the conversion of a stated amount
at maturity of US$156 million of the convertible debentures due 2006. The
redemption and share issue, a non-cash transaction, was not included on the cash

In the fourth quarter of 2004, revenues from operations were $1.05 billion
compared with $716 million in the same period a year ago. Major increases over
2003 were due to higher copper, zinc, coal and molybdenum prices. The additional
34% interest in Highland Valley Copper contributed revenues of $75 million in
the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
Net earnings in the fourth quarter of 2004 were $285 million or $1.42 per share
compared with net earnings of $104 million or $0.56 per share (as restated) in
the fourth quarter of 2003.
</P>
<P>
The higher earnings in the fourth quarter of 2004 were principally the result of
higher prices for the company's products. The average LME prices for copper,
zinc and lead were US$1.40, US$0.51, and US$0.43 per pound respectively in the
quarter, up 50%, 19%, and 59% from the same period a year earlier. A weaker U.S.
dollar partially offset the effect of the higher commodity prices. The company's
realized Canadian/U.S. dollar exchange rate including hedging gains was 1.25 in
the fourth quarter, compared with 1.39 in the fourth quarter of 2003.
</P>
<P>
Fourth quarter earnings of 2004 included gains on disposition of assets of $36
million. Net earnings in the fourth quarter of 2003 included an after-tax gain
of $41 million on the sale of the Los Filos gold property.

Cash flow from operations, before changes to non-cash working capital items, was
$400 million in the fourth quarter of 2004 compared with $139 million in the
fourth quarter of 2003, due mainly to increased operating profits resulting from
higher prices for the company's products. In addition to stronger commodity
prices, other factors contributing to the higher cash flow included the
acquisition of an additional 34% interest in Highland Valley Copper in the first
quarter of 2004, increased molybdenum production and the consolidation of
Antamina for a full year in 2004 compared with equity-accounting for the first
six months' results of Antamina in 2003.

The company's share of estimated 2005 production volumes for its major products
and some information on production outlook have been disclosed in the Operations

<P>
Refined zinc production, with the sale of Cajamarquilla in December 2004, will
decrease to approximately 295,000 tonnes compared with 413,000 tonnes in 2004.
</P>
<P>
Coal production in 2005 is expected to increase by 17% over 2004 as a result of
the development of the Cheviot Creek pit and the capacity expansion at the
Fording River mine. Zinc production is expected to increase at the Pend Oreille
mine as the mine has made significant progress to reach design production
capacity. Copper production is expected to increase by 10% in 2005, with planned
production increases at both the Highland Valley Copper and Antamina mines due
to higher copper ore grades. Molybdenum production is expected to decrease at
the Highland Valley Copper mine to approximately 5 million pounds in 2005 due to
lower molybdenum ore grades. Gold production is expected to be similar to 2004
at around 250,000 ounces.

<P>
Metal prices, the main reason for the record earnings of the company in 2004,
have remained strong but volatile after the year end due to a number of factors,
including strong demand, uncertainty over the U.S. dollar and concern over the
world economy. Fluctuations in metal prices will affect the company's earnings,
and may result in significant settlement adjustments on outstanding settlements
receivable.
</P>
<P>
Substantially all of Elk Valley Coal Partnership's hard coking coal sales for
the 2005 coal year beginning April 1, 2005 have been contracted at an average
price of US$125 per tonne. Some of the 2005 calendar year sales will include
coal priced at the 2004 coal year prices. As a result of this and other factors,
the weighted average price of 2005 calendar year sales are expected to be
approximately US$100 per tonne, nearly double the weighted average price of
US$52 per tonne in calendar 2004.

<P>
Market conditions for the company's main products are discussed in the Markets
section.
</P>
<P>
The Canadian dollar's recent strength against the U.S. dollar will have a
negative impact on the company's earnings because the prices of the company's
products are denominated in U.S. dollars and a significant portion of the
company's operating costs are Canadian dollar based. Metal prices, however, have
increased to reflect a weaker U.S. dollar as well as responding to tight market
conditions.
</P>
<P>
To mitigate the impact of fluctuations in metal prices and the Canadian/U.S.
dollar exchange rate, the company has made certain forward sales commitments.
The outstanding hedge positions are presented in the notes to the financial
statements.
</P>
<P>
While the company benefits from rising commodity prices, the company's
operations are facing the impact of rising costs. The prices of fuel, steel,
equipment, materials and supplies have been increasing in the last two years.
The company will continue to focus on managing its operating costs and to
achieve operating efficiencies to mitigate the impact of rising prices on
operating costs.

Treatment charges for zinc concentrates are expected to continue to decline in
2005 due to an extremely tight market. While this will negatively impact Trail's
operating income, it will result in overall benefit to the company as the
company is a net miner of zinc with significant production from Red Dog and
Antamina. On the other hand, higher copper prices have resulted in rising mine
production with treatment charges increasing to historical levels.
</P>
<P>
The company's capital expenditures in 2005 are estimated to be $280 million,
with $170 million of sustaining capital expenditures and $110 million of
development expenditures. The majority of the development expenditures is for
the company's share of the Pogo gold project.

Legal Proceedings

<P>
On November 11, 2004, the District Court for Eastern Washington State denied a
motion by Teck Cominco Metals Ltd. (TCML) to dismiss, for want of jurisdiction,
a citizen's suit brought by two members of the Colville Confederated Tribes
supported by the State of Washington. TCML has petitioned for appeal of the
decision to the 9th Circuit Court of Appeal.
</P>
<P>
The Colville suit was brought pursuant to Section 310(a)(i) of the U.S.
Superfund Statute (CERCLA) to enforce a unilateral administrative order issued
by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) purporting to require TCML to
conduct a remedial investigation and feasibility study with respect to metal
contamination in the sediments of the Upper Columbia River and Lake Roosevelt.
The EPA issued the order shortly after breaking off negotiations with the
company during which TCML offered to fund human health and ecological studies,
at an estimated cost of US$13 million, to address the possible impact of
historical discharges from the Trail Metallurgical Operations in British
Columbia. Both the Canadian government and the company have the view that the
EPA does not have jurisdiction to apply U.S. law in Canada.
</P>
<P>
The Government of Canada and the Government of U.S.A. are continuing to pursue a
bilateral agreement to facilitate the studies and appropriate remediation to
address environmental concerns about the area. Such an agreement could provide a
basis under which TCML's offer of funding for this work could be implemented.
</P>
<P>
There can be no assurance that the offer to fund the studies will resolve the
matter, or that TCML or its affiliates will not be faced with liability in
relation to this matter. Until studies of the kind described above are
completed, it is not possible to estimate the extent and cost, if any, of
remediation that may be required.

Canada pursuant to the Competition Act to produce documents relevant to the
marketing of custom copper concentrates. The company understands that this is
part of an ongoing industry-wide investigation involving major copper
concentrate producers commenced in Canada, the United States and Europe to
determine whether there is evidence of a cartel agreement and related illegal
practices concerning pricing, customer allocation and market sharing in the
copper concentrate sector. The company has been advised by the United States
Department of Justice that it intends to close its investigation. There can be
no assurance that the investigation will not result in further regulatory action
against the company or HVC in Canada or elsewhere or that HVC or the company
will not face prosecution or liability under the Act otherwise in relation to
the investigation. The company can also offer no guidance or assurance as to the

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES
</SPAN>
</P>
<P>
In preparing financial statements management has to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues
and expenses. Based on historical experience, current conditions and expert
advice, management makes assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under
the circumstances. These estimates and assumptions form the basis for judgments
about the carrying value of assets and liabilities and reported amounts for
revenues and expenses. Different assumptions would result in different estimates
and actual results may differ from results based on these estimates. These
estimates and assumptions are also affected by management's application of
accounting policies. Critical accounting estimates are those that affect the
consolidated financial statements materially and involve a significant level of
judgment by management. Management's critical accounting estimates are applied
in the accounting for the impairment of property, plant and equipment and other
assets such as investments, restoration and post-closure costs, accounting for
income and mining taxes, contingencies and accounting for post-retirement
benefits.
</P>
<P>
<SPAN STYLE="font-weight: bold">
Property, Plant and Equipment
</SPAN>
</P>
<P>
The company capitalizes the development costs of mining projects commencing when
economically recoverable reserves as shown by an economic study are believed to
exist. Upon commencement of production these costs are written off over the life
of the mine based on proven and probable reserves. The determination of the
extent of reserves is a complex task in which a number of estimates and
assumptions are made. These involve the use of geological sampling and models as
well as estimates of future costs. New knowledge derived from further
exploration and development of the ore body may also affect reserve estimates.
In addition, the determination of economic reserves depends on assumptions on
long-term commodity prices and in some cases exchange rates.
</P>
<P>
The company reviews and evaluates property, plant and equipment for impairment
on an ongoing basis. The expected undiscounted future cash flows from an asset
are estimated in a ceiling test. These future cash flows are developed using
assumptions that reflect the long-term operating plans for an asset given
management's best estimate of the most probable set of economic conditions.
Commodity prices used reflect market conditions at the time the model is
developed. These models are updated from time to time and lower prices are used
should market conditions deteriorate. Inherent in these assumptions are
significant risks and uncertainties. In management's view, based on assumptions
which management believes to be reasonable, a reduction in the carrying value of
property, plant and

Income and Resource Taxes
</SPAN>
</P>
<P>
The determination of the company's tax expense for the year and its future tax
liabilities and assets involves significant management estimation and judgment
involving a number of assumptions. In determining these amounts management
interprets tax legislation in a variety of jurisdictions and makes estimates of
the expected timing of the reversal of future tax assets and liabilities.
Management also makes estimates of the future earnings which affect the extent
to which potential future tax benefits may be used. The company is subject to
assessment by various taxation authorities which may interpret tax legislation
in a manner different from the company. These differences may affect the final
amount or the timing of the payment of taxes. When such differences arise the
company makes provision for such items based on management's best estimate of
the final outcome of these matters.

<P>
<SPAN STYLE="font-weight: bold">
Pension and Other Post-Retirement Benefits
</SPAN>
</P>
<P>
The cost of providing benefits through defined benefit pension plans and
post-retirement benefits plans is actuarially determined. Cost and obligation
estimates depend on management's assumptions about future events which are used
by the actuaries in calculating such amounts. These include assumptions with
respect to discount rates, the expected return on plan assets, future
compensation increases and health care cost trends. In addition, actuarial
consultants utilize subjective factors such as withdrawal and mortality rates.
Actual results may differ materially from those estimates based on these
assumptions.

<P>
<SPAN STYLE="font-weight: bold">
Asset Retirement Obligations
</SPAN>
</P>
<P>
The amounts recorded for asset retirement costs are based on estimates included
in closure and remediation plans. These estimates are based on engineering
studies of the work that is required by environmental laws, or public statements
by management which result in an obligation. These estimates include an
assumption on the rate at which costs may inflate in future periods. Actual
results could differ from these estimates.

Recognition of Contingencies

</P>
<P>
The company is subject to a number of lawsuits and threatened lawsuits. A
provision is made for amounts claimed through these lawsuits when management
believes that it is more likely than not that the plaintiffs will be awarded
damages or a monetary settlement will be made. Management seeks the advice of
outside counsel in making such judgments where the amounts involved are
material.

CHANGES IN ACCOUNTING POLICIES

</P>
<P>
<SPAN STYLE="font-weight: bold">
Asset Retirement Obligations
</SPAN>
</P>
<P>
Effective January 1, 2004 the company adopted a new accounting standard on asset
retirement obligations. Under this standard, asset retirement obligations are
recognized at discounted value for the costs associated with exit activities and
recorded as a liability at fair value. The liability is accreted over time
through periodic charges to earnings. In addition, the asset retirement cost is
capitalized as part of the asset's carrying value at its initial discounted
value and is amortized over the asset's useful life. This change in accounting
policy has been adopted retroactively and has resulted in an increase in
long-term liability of $210 million, an increase to property, plant and
equipment of $113 million, a reduction of future income tax liabilities of $23
million and a decrease to opening retained earnings of $74 million. The change
also resulted in a reduction of $12 million to previously reported 2003 net
earnings.

Stock-Based Compensation

The company has adopted the fair value method of accounting for stock-based
compensation. This method results in the recognition in earnings of the cost of
stock-based compensation based on the estimated fair value of new stock-based
awards granted to directors and employees in the year.
</P>
<P>
This change in accounting policy was adopted retroactively and resulted in a
restatement and reduction of 2003 net earnings by $3 million pertaining to the
stock options granted in the first quarter of 2003. The stock-based compensation
expense with respect to stock options and deferred and restricted share units
granted in 2004 amounts to $7 million.

Guideline 13 on documentation and hedge effectiveness testing standards which
must be met to apply hedge accounting to derivative instruments. The company
continues to be eligible for hedge accounting treatment for its U.S. dollar
forward sales, certain of its forward sale and purchase contracts for its
products, foreign exchange gains and losses on U.S. dollar borrowings and the
Inco exchangeable debenture. Contracts which do not qualify for hedge accounting
treatment are marked to market. No adjustment was required to retained earnings
as a result of the adoption of this standard.

<SPAN STYLE="font-weight: bold">
Underground Amortization
</SPAN>
</P>
<P>
Effective January 1, 2004 the company adopted the block model method of
underground amortization. Under this method underground development costs
related to the development of particular sections of a mine are amortized over
the reserves of that section. Previously the company did not differentiate
between sections, with costs going into a common pool and amortized over the
reserves of the mine. This resulted in an escalating amortization charge over
the life of the mine. The application of the new method, which is considered to
be the preferred practice, has resulted in a $4 million charge to opening
retained earnings and will decrease future amortization charges at the Hemlo
mines by $1 million per year.
</P>
<P>
<SPAN STYLE="font-weight: bold">
Depreciation in Inventory
</SPAN>
</P>
<P>
A new standard on Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) defines what
constitutes Canadian GAAP and establishes a relative hierarchy for sources of
GAAP. The CICA Handbook is confirmed as the primary source of Canadian GAAP
while secondary sources include International Accounting Standards and US GAAP.
Industry practice is no longer considered a valid source of GAAP. As a result,
the company has amended its inventory valuation policy to include depreciation
and amortization charges in the cost of inventory. Previously amortization and
depreciation were charged directly to earnings based on sales volumes. The new
policy does not affect reported earnings in any year but does affect reported
inventory and property, plant and equipment values. As a result, the company has
increased the reported value of inventory by $9 million at January 1, 2004 and
reduced fixed assets by the same amount.
</P>
<P>
<SPAN STYLE="font-weight: bold">
Variable Interest Entities
</SPAN>
</P>
<P>
Effective January 1, 2005, the company will adopt the new Accounting Guideline
<BR>
15 (AcG-15) &quot;Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities&quot;. The new standard
establishes when a company should consolidate a variable interest entity in its
financial statements. AcG-15 provides the definition of a variable interest
entity and requires a variable interest entity to be consolidated if a company
is at risk of absorbing the variable interest entity's expected losses, or is
entitled to receive a majority of the variable interest entity's residual
returns, or both. Adoption of this guideline is not expected to result in any
material impact to earnings or retained earnings.

$61 million based on actuarial estimates prepared on a going concern
basis. The amount of minimum funding for 2005 in respect of defined
benefit pension plans is $48 million. The timing and amount of additional
funding after 2005 is dependent upon future returns on plan assets,
discount rates, and other actuarial assumptions.
</P>
<P>
(4)   The company had a discounted, actuarially determined liability of $229
million in respect of other non-pension post-retirement benefits as at

multiple voting nature of the Class A Common Shares. Similarly the company's
Class B Subordinate Voting Shares, which traded under the symbol TEK.B, now
trade under the symbol TEK.SV.B, the SV suffix denoting the subordinate voting

AUDITORS' REPORT TO SHAREHOLDERS
</SPAN>
</P>
<P>
We have audited the consolidated balance sheets of Teck Cominco Limited as at
December 31, 2004 and 2003 and the consolidated statements of earnings, retained
earnings and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended
December 31, 2004. These consolidated financial statements are the
responsibility of the company's management. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.
</P>
<P>
We conducted our audits in accordance with Canadian generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform an audit to obtain
reasonable assurance whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.
</P>
<P>
An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation.
</P>
<P>
In our opinion, these consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all
material respects, the financial position of the company as at December 31, 2004
and 2003 and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the
years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2004 in accordance with
Canadian generally accepted accounting principles.

Comments by Auditors for United States Readers on Canada-United States Reporting
Differences

<P>
In the United States, reporting standards for auditors require the addition of
an explanatory paragraph (following the opinion paragraph) when there are
changes in accounting principles that have a material effect on the
comparability of the company's financial statements, such as the changes
described in note 3 to the financial statements. Our report to the shareholders
dated February 4, 2005 is expressed in accordance with Canadian reporting
standards which do not require a reference to such a change in accounting
principles in the auditors' report when the change is properly accounted for and
adequately disclosed in the financial statements.
