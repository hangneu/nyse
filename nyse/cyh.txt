</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:2%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	We are one of
	the largest publicly-traded hospital companies in the United States and a leading operator of general acute care hospitals in communities across the country. We were originally founded in 1986 and were reincorporated in 1996 as a Delaware
	corporation. We provide healthcare services through the hospitals that we own and operate and affiliated businesses in non-urban and selected urban markets throughout the United States. As of December&nbsp;31, 2015, we owned or leased 194 hospitals
	included in continuing operations, comprised of 190 general acute care hospitals and four stand-alone rehabilitation or psychiatric hospitals. These hospitals are geographically diversified across 28 states, with an aggregate of 29,853 licensed
	beds. We generate revenues by providing a broad range of general and specialized hospital healthcare services and other outpatient services to patients in the communities in which we are located. Services provided through our hospitals and
	affiliated businesses include general acute care, emergency room, general and specialty surgery, critical care, internal medicine, obstetrics, diagnostic, psychiatric and rehabilitation services. We also provide additional outpatient services at
	urgent care centers, occupational medicine clinics, imaging centers, cancer centers, ambulatory surgery centers and home health and hospice agencies. An integral part of providing these services is our relationship and network of affiliated
	physicians at our hospitals and affiliated businesses. As of December&nbsp;31, 2015, we employed approximately 3,400 physicians and an additional 1,000 licensed healthcare practitioners. Through our management and operation of these businesses, we
	provide standardization and centralization of operations across key business areas; strategic assistance to expand and improve services and facilities; implementation of patient safety and quality of care improvement programs and assistance in the
	recruitment of additional physicians and licensed healthcare practitioners to the markets in which our hospitals are located. In a number of our markets, we have partnered with local physicians or not-for-profit providers, or both, in the ownership
	of our facilities. In addition to our hospitals and related businesses, we also owned and operated 79 licensed home care agencies and 22 licensed hospice agencies as of December&nbsp;31, 2015, located primarily in markets where we also operate a
	hospital. Also, through our wholly-owned subsidiary, Quorum Health Resources, LLC, or QHR, we provide management and consulting services to non-affiliated general acute care hospitals located throughout the United States. For the services we provide
	through hospitals and home care agencies that we own and operate, we are paid by governmental agencies, private insurers and directly by the patients we serve. For our management and consulting services, we are paid by the non-affiliated hospitals
	utilizing our services. The financial information for our reportable operating segments is presented in Note&nbsp;15 of the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item&nbsp;8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, or Form 10-K.

	Our strategy includes growth by acquisition. We generally target hospitals in growing, non-urban and selected urban healthcare markets
	for acquisition because of their favorable demographic and economic trends and competitive conditions. Because non-urban and suburban service areas have smaller populations, there are generally fewer hospitals and other healthcare service providers
	in these communities and generally a lower level of managed care presence in these markets. We believe that communities with smaller populations generally view the local hospital as an integral part of the community and support less direct
	competition for hospital-based services. We believe opportunities exist for skilled, disciplined operators in selected urban markets to create networks between urban hospitals and non-urban hospitals while improving physician alignment in both those
	markets and making it more attractive to managed care. In recent years, our acquisition strategy has also included acquiring selected physician practices and physician-owned ancillary service providers. Such acquisitions are executed in markets
	where we already have a hospital presence and provide an opportunity to increase the number of affiliated physicians or expand the range of specialized healthcare services provided by our hospitals.

	Physician Recruiting.
</I>
	&nbsp;The primary method of adding or expanding medical services is the recruitment of new physicians into the
	community. A core group of primary care physicians is necessary as an initial contact point for all local healthcare. The addition of specialists who offer services, including general surgery, obstetrics and gynecology, cardiovascular services,
	orthopedics and urology, completes the full range of medical and surgical services required to meet a community&#146;s core healthcare needs. At the time we acquire a hospital and from time to time thereafter, we identify the healthcare needs of the
	community in which such hospital is located by analyzing demographic data and patient referral trends. As a result of this analysis, we are able to determine what we believe to be the optimum mix of primary care physicians and specialists. We employ
	recruiters at the corporate level to support the local hospital managers in their recruitment efforts. Additionally, in response to the recent trend in physicians seeking employment, we have begun employing more physicians, including, in many
	instances, acquiring physician practices. We have increased the number of physicians affiliated with us through our recruiting and employment efforts. The percentage of recruited or other physicians commencing practice with us that were specialists
	was over 55% in 2015. However, most of the physicians in our communities remain in private practice and are not our employees. We believe we have been successful in recruiting physicians because of the practice opportunities afforded physicians in
	our markets, as well as lower managed care penetration as compared to larger urban areas.

	&nbsp;In an effort to better meet the healthcare needs of the communities we serve and to capture a greater portion of the healthcare spending in our markets, we have added a broad range of services to our facilities and, in certain

	services. We have concentrated our focus on expanding our service lines to those service offerings that we believe have the greatest growth potential,

	We spent approximately $451&nbsp;million on 70 major construction projects that were
	completed in 2015. The 2015 projects included new emergency rooms, cardiac catheterization laboratories, hospital additions and surgical suites. These projects improved various diagnostic and other inpatient and outpatient service capabilities. We
	believe that appropriate capital investments in our facilities, combined with the development of our service capabilities, will reduce the migration of patients to competing providers while providing an attractive return on investment. We also
	employ a small group of clinical consultants at our corporate headquarters to assist the hospitals in their development of surgery, emergency, critical care, cardiovascular and hospitalist services. In addition to spending capital on expanding
	services at our existing hospitals, we also build replacement facilities in certain markets to better meet the healthcare needs in those communities. In 2015 and 2014, we spent $123 million and $120 million, respectively, on construction projects
	related to the Birmingham and York replacement hospitals discussed below. In September 2010, we received approval of our request for a certificate of need, or CON, from the Alabama Certificate of Need Review Board for a replacement hospital in
	Birmingham, Alabama. This CON was challenged in the Alabama state circuit and appellate courts, but the CON was upheld by the Supreme Court of Alabama in May 2013, eliminating any further appeals. Completion of the replacement hospital, Grandview
	Medical Center, and transfer of all operations was completed on October&nbsp;10, 2015. As part of an acquisition in 2012, we agreed to build a replacement hospital in York, Pennsylvania by July 2017. The total cost of the replacement hospital in

<I>
	Managed Care Strategy.
</I>
	&nbsp;Managed care has seen growth across the
	U.S.&nbsp;as health plans expand service areas and membership in an attempt to control rising medical costs. As we service primarily non-urban markets, we do not have significant relationships with individual managed care organizations, including
	Medicare Advantage. We have responded with a proactive and carefully considered strategy developed specifically for each of our facilities. Our experienced corporate managed care department reviews and approves all managed care contracts, which are
	organized and monitored using a central database. The primary mission of this department is to select and evaluate appropriate managed care opportunities, manage existing reimbursement arrangements and negotiate increases. Generally, we do not
	intend to enter into capitated or risk sharing contracts. However, some purchased hospitals have risk sharing contracts at the time we acquire them. We seek to discontinue these contracts to eliminate risk retention related to payment for patient
	care. We do not believe that we have, at the present time, any risk sharing contracts that would have a material impact on our results of operations.

	Our case management program integrates the
	functions of utilization review, discharge planning, assessment of medical necessity and resource management. Patients are assessed upon presentation to the hospital and throughout their course of care with ongoing reviews. Industry standard
	criteria are utilized in patient assessments, and discharge plans are adjusted according to patient needs. Cases are monitored to prevent delays in service or unnecessary utilization of resources. When a patient is ready for discharge, a case
	manager works with the patient&#146;s attending physician to evaluate and coordinate the patient&#146;s needs for continued care in the post-acute setting. Each hospital has the support of a physician advisor to act as a liaison to the medical staff
	and assist with all the activities of the program.

	Occasionally, we have pursued acquisition opportunities outside of our specified criteria when such opportunities have had uniquely favorable

	the facilities. Based on our historical experience, we then build a pro forma financial model that reflects what we believe can be accomplished under our ownership. Whether we buy or lease the existing facility or agree to construct a replacement
	hospital, we believe we have been disciplined in our approach to pricing. We typically begin the acquisition process by entering into a non-binding letter of intent with an acquisition candidate. After we complete business and financial due
	diligence and financial modeling, we decide whether or not to enter into a definitive agreement. Once an acquisition is completed, we have an organized and systematic approach to transitioning and integrating the new hospital into our system of
	hospitals.

	Acquisition Efforts.
</I>
	&nbsp;A key part of our strategy involves establishing a broader presence in our states and markets
	of operation and expanding and strengthening our regional networks where appropriate. Apart from our acquisition of Triad hospitals in 2007 and HMA in 2014, most of our acquisition targets have been municipal or other not-for-profit hospitals. We
	believe that our access to capital, ability to recruit physicians and reputation for providing quality care make us an attractive partner for these communities. In addition, we have found that communities located in states where we already operate a
	hospital are more receptive to our acquiring their hospitals, because they are aware of our operating track record with respect to our other hospitals within the state.

	Hospital services, the market within the healthcare industry in which we operate, is the largest single category of healthcare expenditures at
	32.1% of total healthcare spending in 2014, or approximately $972 billion, as reported by CMS. CMS projected the hospital services category to increase 5.4% in 2015 due to the continued effects of the Affordable Care Act insurance expansion combined
	with the effect of faster economic growth. For 2016 through 2024, CMS projected that continued population aging and the impact of improved economic conditions will result in projected average annual growth of 6.1%.

	U.S.&nbsp;Hospital Industry.
</I>
	&nbsp;The U.S.&nbsp;hospital industry is broadly defined to include acute care, rehabilitation and
	psychiatric facilities that are either public (government owned and operated), not-for-profit private (religious or secular), or for-profit institutions (investor owned). According to the American Hospital Association, there are approximately 5,000
	inpatient hospitals in the U.S.&nbsp;which are not-for-profit owned, investor owned, or state or local government owned. Of these hospitals, approximately 40% are located in non-urban communities. We believe that a majority of these hospitals are
	owned by not-for-profit or governmental entities. These facilities offer a broad range of healthcare services, including internal medicine, general surgery, cardiology, oncology, orthopedics, OB/GYN and emergency services. In addition, hospitals
	also offer other ancillary services, including psychiatric, diagnostic, rehabilitation, home care and outpatient surgery services.

	. According to the U.S.&nbsp;Census Bureau, 19.3% of the U.S.&nbsp;population lives in communities
	designated as non-urban. In these non-urban communities, hospitals are typically the primary source of healthcare. In many cases a single hospital is the only provider of general healthcare services in these communities.

	Demographic Trends.
</I>
	&nbsp;According to the U.S.&nbsp;Census Bureau, in 2014, there were approximately 46.2&nbsp;million Americans aged
	65 or older in the U.S. comprising approximately 14.5% of the total U.S.&nbsp;population. By the year 2030, the number of Americans aged 65 or older is expected to climb to 72.1&nbsp;million, or 19.3% of the total population. Due to the increasing
	life expectancy of Americans, the number of people aged 85&nbsp;years and older is also expected to increase from 6.2&nbsp;million in 2014 to 8.7&nbsp;million by the year 2030. This increase in life expectancy will increase demand for healthcare
	services and, as importantly, the demand for innovative, more sophisticated means of delivering those services. Hospitals, as the largest category of care in the healthcare market, will be among the main beneficiaries of this increase in demand.
	Based on data compiled for us, the populations of the service areas where our hospitals are located grew 3.2% from 2010 to 2015 and are expected to grow by 3.6% from 2015 to 2020. The number of people aged 65 or older in these service areas grew by
	15.8% from 2010 to 2015 and is expected to grow by 16.6% from 2015 to 2020. People aged 65 or older comprised 16.8% of the total population in our service areas in 2015, yet they could comprise 18.9% of the total population in our service areas by
	2020.

	EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure, consists of net income attributable to Community Health Systems, Inc. before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA, also a non-GAAP financial
	measure, is EBITDA adjusted to exclude discontinued operations, loss from early extinguishment of debt, impairment of long-lived assets, net income attributable to noncontrolling interests, acquisition and integration expenses from the acquisition
	of HMA, expenses incurred related to the planned spin-off of Quorum Health Corporation, expenses related to government legal settlements and related costs, and (income) expense from fair value adjustments related to the HMA legal proceedings
	accounted for at fair value, underlying the CVR agreement, and related legal expenses. We have from time to time sold noncontrolling interests in certain of our subsidiaries or acquired subsidiaries with existing noncontrolling interest ownership
	positions. We believe that it is useful to present adjusted EBITDA because it excludes the portion of EBITDA attributable to these third-party interests and clarifies for investors our portion of EBITDA generated by continuing operations. We use
	adjusted EBITDA as a measure of liquidity. We have also presented adjusted EBITDA because we believe it provides investors with additional information about our ability to incur and service debt and make capital expenditures. Adjusted EBITDA also
	aligns with a similar metric as defined in our senior secured credit facility, which is a key component in the determination of our compliance with some of the covenants under our senior secured credit facility, and is used to determine the interest
	rate and commitment fee payable under the senior secured credit facility (although adjusted EBITDA does not include all of the adjustments described in the senior secured credit facility).

	charges and amounts paid for hospital services by Medicare and Medicaid programs, insurance companies, HMOs, PPOs and other managed care companies, but are responsible for services not covered by these programs or plans, as well as for deductibles
	and co-insurance obligations of their coverage. The amount of these deductibles and co-insurance obligations has increased in recent years. Collection of amounts due from individuals is typically more difficult than collection of amounts due from
	government or business payors. To further reduce their healthcare costs, an increasing number of insurance companies, HMOs, PPOs and other managed care companies negotiate discounted fee structures or fixed amounts for hospital services performed,
	rather than paying healthcare providers the amounts billed, and utilize structures such as narrow networks that restrict the providers that enrollees may utilize. We negotiate discounts with managed care companies, which are typically smaller than
	discounts under government programs. If an increased number of insurance companies, HMOs, PPOs and other managed care companies succeed in negotiating discounted fee structures or fixed amounts or if we are unable to participate in managed care
	networks serving our markets, our results of operations may be negatively affected. There can be no assurance that we will retain our existing reimbursement arrangements or that these third-party payors will not attempt to further reduce the rates

<I>
	Overview.
</I>
	&nbsp;The healthcare industry is required to comply with extensive government regulation at the federal, state and local
	levels. Under these regulations, hospitals must meet requirements to be certified as hospitals and qualified to participate in government programs, including the Medicare and Medicaid programs. These requirements include those relating to the
	adequacy of medical care, equipment, personnel, operating policies and procedures; billing and coding for services; properly handling overpayments; classifications of levels of care provided; preparing and filing of cost reports; relationships with
	referral sources and referral recipients; maintenance of adequate records; hospital use; rate-setting; compliance with building codes; environmental protection; and privacy and security. There are also extensive laws and regulations governing a
	hospital&#146;s participation in these government programs. If we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations, we may be subject to criminal penalties and civil sanctions, our hospitals could lose their licenses and we could lose our ability
	to participate in these government programs. Further, government regulations may change. If that happens, we may have to make changes in our facilities, equipment, personnel and services so that our hospitals remain certified as hospitals and
	qualified to participate in these programs. We believe that our hospitals are currently in substantial compliance with current federal, state and local regulations and standards. We cannot make assertions that governmental officials responsible for
	enforcing these laws or whistleblowers will not assert that we are in violation of them or that such statutes or regulations will be interpreted by the courts in a manner consistent with our interpretation.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:2%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Hospitals are subject to periodic inspection by federal, state and local authorities to determine their compliance with applicable regulations
	and requirements necessary for licensing and certification. All of our hospitals are licensed under appropriate state laws and are qualified to participate in Medicare and Medicaid programs. In addition, most of our hospitals are accredited by The
	Joint Commission. This accreditation indicates that a hospital satisfies the applicable health and administrative standards to participate in Medicare and Medicaid programs.

	Healthcare Reform.
</I>
	&nbsp;The U.S. Congress and certain state legislatures have introduced and passed a large number of proposals and
	legislation designed to make major changes in the healthcare system, including changes that increased access to health insurance. The Reform Legislation mandates that substantially all U.S. citizens maintain medical insurance coverage and expands
	health insurance coverage through a combination of public program expansion and private sector health insurance reforms. Based on projections issued by the Congressional Budget Office, or CBO, in March 2015, the incremental insurance coverage due to
	the Reform Legislation could result in 25&nbsp;million formerly uninsured Americans gaining coverage by the end of 2025.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:2%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	As the number of
	persons with access to health insurance in the United States increases, there may be a resulting increase in the number of patients using our facilities who have health insurance coverage. We operate hospitals in eight of the 10 states that
	experienced the largest reductions in uninsured rates among adult residents between 2013 and 2015. Most of these states with the greatest reductions in the number of uninsured adult residents have established a health insurance exchange operated
	either by the state or in partnership with the federal government and also expanded Medicaid. However, states may opt out of the Medicaid coverage expansion provisions of the Reform Legislation without losing existing federal Medicaid funding. A
	number of states have opted out of the Medicaid coverage expansion provisions, but could ultimately decide to expand their programs at a later date. Of the 28 states in which we operate hospitals that are included in continuing operations, 15 states
	have taken action to expand their Medicaid programs, including Louisiana, which is expected to implement Medicaid coverage expansion at some point in 2016. At this time, the other 13 states have not, including Florida, Tennessee and Texas, where we
	operated a significant number of hospitals as of December&nbsp;31, 2015. Some states that have opted out are evaluating options such as waiver plans to operate an alternative Medicaid expansion plan. Failure to expand Medicaid or implement an
	effective alternative in these states will likely have a negative impact on the goal of reducing the number of uninsured individuals.

	Our hospitals are well positioned to participate in the provider networks of various qualified
	health plans, or QHPs, offering plan options on the health insurance exchanges created pursuant to the Reform Legislation. For the 2016 plan year, all of our hospitals in continuing operations have arrangements to participate in at least one health
	insurance exchange agreement, approximately 90% of our hospitals participate in two or more contracts, approximately 87% of our hospitals participate in the first or second lowest cost bronze plan networks (QHPs with a 60% actuarial value) and
	approximately 90% of our hospitals participate in the first or second lowest cost silver plan networks (QHPs with a 70% actuarial value).

	We have conducted significant healthcare reform outreach efforts across all of our markets. Such efforts included the expanded use of
	eligibility screening services, select facility designations as Certified Application Counselor Organizations, and approximately 700 volunteers and staff members trained and designated as Certified Application Counselors, or CACs. These CACs
	assisted people in understanding and, if appropriate, enrolling in new coverage options, including, but not limited to QHPs on the health insurance exchange or Marketplace, Medicaid and the Children&#146;s Health Insurance Program, or CHIP.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:2%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The Reform Legislation makes a number of changes to Medicare and Medicaid, such as reductions to the Medicare annual market basket update for
	federal fiscal years 2010 through 2019, a productivity offset to the Medicare market basket update, and a reduction to the Medicare and Medicaid disproportionate share payments, each of which could adversely impact the reimbursement received under
	these programs.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:2%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The Reform Legislation also includes provisions aimed at reducing fraud, waste and abuse in the healthcare industry.
	These provisions allocate significant additional resources to federal enforcement agencies and expand the use of private contractors to recover potentially inappropriate Medicare and Medicaid payments. The Reform Legislation amends several existing
	federal laws, including the federal anti-kickback statute and the False Claims Act making it easier for government agencies and private plaintiffs to prevail in lawsuits brought against healthcare providers. These amendments also make it easier for
	potentially severe fines and penalties to be imposed on healthcare providers that violate applicable laws and regulations.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:2%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	We believe the
	expansion of private sector health insurance and Medicaid coverage will, over time, increase our reimbursement related to providing services to individuals who were previously uninsured, which should reduce our expense from uncollectible accounts
	receivable. The various provisions in the Reform Legislation that directly or indirectly affect reimbursement take effect over a number of years. In addition, we believe that the Reform Legislation had a positive impact on net operating revenues and
	income from continuing operations during 2014 and 2015 as the result of the expansion of private sector and Medicaid coverage that has already occurred from the Reform Legislation and we believe that the net impact of the Reform Legislation on our
	net operating revenues will continue to be positive. Other provisions of the Reform Legislation, such as requirements related to employee health insurance coverage, have increased and will continue to increase our operating costs.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:2%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	However, because of the many variables involved, including clarifications and modifications resulting from the rule-making process,
	legislative efforts to repeal or modify the law, future judicial interpretations resulting from court challenges to its constitutionality and interpretation, the development of agency guidance, whether and how many states ultimately decide to expand
	Medicaid coverage, the number of uninsured who elect to purchase health insurance coverage, budgetary issues at federal and state levels, and the potential for delays in the implementation of the Reform Legislation, it is difficult to predict the
	ultimate effect of the Reform Legislation. We may not be able to fully realize the positive impact the Reform Legislation may otherwise have on our business, results of operations, cash flow, capital resources and liquidity. Furthermore, we cannot
	predict whether we will be able to modify certain aspects of our operations to offset any potential adverse consequences from the Reform Legislation.

	Federal False Claims Act and Similar State Laws.
</I>
	&nbsp;Another trend affecting the healthcare industry is
	the increased use of the federal False Claims Act, or FCA, which can be used to prosecute Medicare and other government program fraud involving issues such as coding errors, billing for service not provided and submitting false cost reports.
	Further, the FCA covers payments involving federal funds in connection with the health insurance exchanges created under the Reform Legislation, if those payments involve any federal funds. Liability under the FCA often arises when an entity
	knowingly submits a false claim for reimbursement to the federal government. The FCA broadly defines the term &#147;knowingly.&#148; Although simple negligence will not give rise to liability under the FCA, submitting a claim with reckless disregard
	to its truth or falsity may constitute &#147;knowingly&#148; submitting a false claim and result in liability. Among the many other potential bases for liability under the FCA is the knowing and improper failure to report and refund amounts owed to
	the government within 60 days of identifying an overpayment. Effective March&nbsp;14, 2016, an overpayment is deemed to be identified when a person has, or should have through reasonable diligence, determined that an overpayment was received and
	quantified the overpayment. Submission of a claim for an item or service generated in violation of the anti-kickback statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim under the FCA. In some cases, whistleblowers, the federal government and courts have
	taken the position that providers who allegedly have violated other statutes, such as the Stark Law, have thereby submitted false claims under the FCA.

	defendant has defrauded the federal government. If the government intervenes in the action and prevails, the party filing the initial complaint may share in any settlement or judgment. If the government does not intervene in the action, the
	whistleblower plaintiff may pursue the action independently and may receive a larger share of any settlement or judgment. When a private party brings a qui tam action under the FCA, the defendant generally will not be made aware of the lawsuit until
	the government commences its own investigation or determines whether it will intervene. Every entity that receives at least $5 million annually in Medicaid payments must have written policies for all employees, contractors and agents providing

	HIPAA Administrative Simplification and Privacy and Security Requirements.

	&nbsp;The
	Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, requires the use of uniform electronic data transmission standards for healthcare claims and payment transactions submitted or received electronically. These provisions are
	intended to encourage electronic commerce in the healthcare industry. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS, has established electronic data transmission standards that all healthcare providers must use when submitting or
	receiving certain healthcare transactions electronically. In addition, HIPAA requires that each provider use a National Provider Identifier. As of October&nbsp;1, 2015, all healthcare providers covered by HIPAA are required to use updated standard
	code sets for certain diagnoses and procedures known as ICD-10 code sets. We have transitioned all of our hospitals to the ICD-10 coding system. This transition continues to involve a significant focus on our technology and information systems, as
	well as costs related to training of hospital employees and providers and corporate support staff involved with coding and billing. Use of the ICD-10 code sets has required and continues to require significant changes; however, we believe that the
	cost of compliance with these regulations has not had and is not expected to have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position or results of operations. The Reform Legislation requires the HHS to adopt standards for additional
	electronic transactions and to establish operating rules to promote uniformity in the implementation of each standardized electronic transaction.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:2%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	As required by HIPAA, HHS has issued privacy and security regulations that extensively regulate the use and disclosure of individually
	identifiable health-related information and require covered entities, including health plans and most healthcare providers, to implement administrative, physical and technical practices to protect the security of individually identifiable health
	information that is electronically maintained or transmitted. Certain provisions of the security and privacy regulations apply to business associates (entities that handle identifiable health-related information on behalf of covered entities), and
	business associates are subject to direct liability for violation of the regulations. In addition, a covered entity may be subject to penalties as a result of a business associate violating HIPAA, if the business associate is found to be an agent of
	the covered entity. We have developed and utilize a HIPAA compliance plan as part of our effort to comply with HIPAA privacy and security requirements. The privacy regulations and security regulations have and will continue to impose significant

	Covered entities must report breaches of unsecured protected health
	information to affected individuals without unreasonable delay, but not to exceed 60 days of discovery of the breach by the covered entity or its agents. Notification must also be made to HHS and, in certain situations involving large breaches, to
	the media. HHS is required to publish on its website a list of all covered entities that report a breach involving more than 500 individuals. All non-permitted uses or disclosures of unsecured protected health information are presumed to be breaches
	unless the covered entity or business associate establishes that there is a low probability the information has been compromised. Various state laws and regulations may also require us to notify affected individuals in the event of a data breach

</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:2%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Payments for inpatient acute services are generally made pursuant to a prospective payment system, commonly known as &#147;PPS.&#148; Under
	PPS, our hospitals are paid a predetermined amount for each hospital discharge based on the patient&#146;s diagnosis. Specifically, each discharge is assigned to a diagnosis-related group, commonly known as a &#147;DRG,&#148; based upon the
	patient&#146;s condition and treatment during the relevant inpatient stay. Each DRG is assigned a payment rate using 100% of the national average cost per case and 100% of the severity-adjusted DRG weights. DRG payments are based on national
	averages and not on charges or costs specific to a hospital. Severity-adjusted DRGs more accurately reflect the costs a hospital incurs for caring for a patient and account more fully for the severity of each patient&#146;s condition. However, DRG
	payments are adjusted by a predetermined geographic adjustment factor assigned to the geographic area in which the hospital is located. While a hospital generally does not receive payment in addition to a DRG payment, hospitals may qualify for an
	&#147;outlier&#148; payment when the relevant patient&#146;s treatment costs are extraordinarily high and exceed a specified regulatory threshold.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:2%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The DRG payment rates are adjusted by an update factor on October&nbsp;1 of each year, the beginning of the federal fiscal year. The index
	used to adjust the DRG payment rates, known as the &#147;market basket index,&#148; gives consideration to the inflation experienced by hospitals in purchasing goods and services. DRG payment rates were increased by the full &#147;market basket
	index,&#148; for the federal fiscal years 2015 and 2016 by 2.9% and 2.4% respectively, subject to certain reductions. For federal fiscal year 2015, the DRG payment rates were reduced by 0.8% for documentation and coding; reduced by 0.5% for the
	multi-factor productivity adjustment; and reduced by 0.2% in accordance with the Reform Legislation. For federal fiscal year 2016, the DRG payment rates were reduced by 0.8% for documentation and coding; reduced by 0.5% for the multi-factor
	productivity adjustment; and reduced by 0.2% in accordance with the Reform Legislation. There is also a negative 0.2% adjustment to offset projected spending increases associated with admission and medical review criteria for inpatient services
	commonly known as the &#147;two midnight rule.&#148; Under the rule, services to Medicare beneficiaries are only payable as inpatient hospital services when there is a reasonable expectation that the hospital care is medically necessary and will be
	required across two midnights, absent unusual circumstances. A two percentage point reduction to the market basket index occurs if patient quality data is not submitted, and a reduction of one-half of the market basket index update occurs for
	hospitals that fail to demonstrate meaningful use of certified electronic health records, or EHR, technology without receiving a hardship exception. Future legislation may decrease the rate of increase for DRG payments or even decrease such payment
	rates, but we are not able to predict the amount of any reduction or the effect that any reduction will have on us.

	The DRG payment rates
	are also adjusted pursuant to provisions of the Reform Legislation that promote value-based purchasing, linking payments to quality and efficiency. First, hospitals that meet or exceed certain quality performance standards will receive greater
	reimbursement under CMS&#146;s value-based purchasing program, while hospitals that do not satisfy certain quality performance standards will receive reduced Medicare inpatient hospital payments. The amount collected from the reductions is pooled
	and used to fund the payments that reward hospitals based on a set of quality measures that have been linked to improved clinical processes of care and patient satisfaction. CMS scores each hospital on its achievement relative to other hospitals and
	improvement relative to that hospital&#146;s own past performance. Second, hospitals experiencing &#147;excess readmissions&#148; for conditions designated by CMS within 30 days from the patient&#146;s date of discharge will receive inpatient
	payments reduced by an amount determined by comparing that hospital&#146;s readmission performance to a

	In
	addition, hospitals may qualify for Medicare disproportionate share payments when their percentage of low income patients exceeds specified regulatory thresholds. A majority of our hospitals qualify to receive Medicare disproportionate share
	payments. Medicare disproportionate share payments are reduced by 75% and earmarked for an uncompensated care payment pool, in accordance with the Reform Legislation. The uncompensated care pool is further reduced each year by a formula that
	reflects reductions in the U.S. uninsured population that is under 65 years of age. Thus, the greater the level of coverage for the uninsured, the more the Medicare uncompensated care pool will be reduced. Each eligible hospital is then paid, out of
	the uncompensated care pool, an amount based upon its estimated cost of providing uncompensated care. At this time, we cannot predict an impact for this change. These Medicare disproportionate share and uncompensated care payments as a percentage of
	operating revenues, net of contractual allowances and discounts (but before the provision for bad debts), were 1.2% and 1.5% for the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Hospitals may also qualify for Medicaid disproportionate

	Similar programs are also being considered by other states. We can provide no assurance that reductions to Medicaid funding will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations. Further, the Reform Legislation prohibits

	In addition to the competition we face for acquisitions, we must also compete with other hospitals and healthcare providers for patients. The
	competition among hospitals and other healthcare providers for patients has intensified in recent years. The majority of our hospitals are located in non-urban service areas in which we are the sole provider of general acute care health services.
	Those hospitals in non-urban service areas face no direct competition because there are no other hospitals in their primary service areas. However, these hospitals face competition from hospitals outside of their primary service area, including
	hospitals in urban areas that provide more complex services. Patients in those service areas may travel to these other hospitals for a variety of reasons, including the need for services we do not offer or physician referrals. Patients who are

	The number and quality of the physicians on a
	hospital&#146;s staff is an important factor in a hospital&#146;s competitive position. Physicians decide whether a patient is admitted to the hospital and the procedures to be performed. Admitting physicians may be on the medical staffs of other
	hospitals in addition to those of our hospitals. We attempt to attract our physicians&#146; patients to our hospitals by offering quality services and facilities, convenient locations and state-of-the-art equipment. In addition, CMS publicizes on
	its Hospital Compare website data that hospitals submit in connection with Medicare reimbursement claims, including performance data related to quality measures and patient satisfaction surveys. Federal law provides for the future expansion of the
	number of quality measures that must be reported. Additional quality measures and other future trends toward clinical transparency may have a potential impact on our competitive position and patient volumes in ways that we are unable to predict. In
	addition, as a result of the Reform Legislation, hospitals must either make public a list of their standard charges, or their policies for allowing the public to view a list of these charges in response to an inquiry.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:2%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	We take an
	operations team approach to compliance and utilize corporate experts for program design efforts and facility leaders for employee-level implementation. We believe compliance is another area that demonstrates our utilization of standardization and
	centralization techniques and initiatives which yield efficiencies and consistency throughout our facilities. We recognize that our compliance with applicable laws and regulations depends on individual employee actions as well as company operations.
	Our approach focuses on integrating compliance responsibilities with operational functions. This approach is intended to reinforce our company-wide commitment to operate strictly in accordance with the laws and regulations that govern our business.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:2%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Our company-wide compliance program has been in place since 1997. Currently, the program&#146;s elements include leadership, management
	and oversight at the highest levels, a Code of Conduct, risk area specific policies and procedures, employee education and training, an internal system for reporting concerns, auditing and monitoring programs and a means for enforcing the
	program&#146;s policies.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:2%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The compliance program continues to be expanded and developed to meet the industry&#146;s expectations and our
	needs. Specific written policies, procedures, training and educational materials and programs, as well as auditing and monitoring activities, have been prepared and implemented to address the functional and operational aspects of our business.
	Included within these functional areas are materials and activities for business sub-units, including laboratory, radiology, pharmacy, emergency, surgery, observation, home care, skilled nursing and clinics. Specific areas identified through
	regulatory interpretation and enforcement activities have also been addressed in our program. Claims preparation and submission, including coding, billing and cost reports, comprise the bulk of these areas. Financial arrangements with physicians and
	other referral sources, including compliance with the federal anti-kickback statute and the Stark Law, emergency department treatment and transfer requirements and other patient disposition issues, are also the focus of policy and training,
	standardized documentation requirements and review and audit. Another focus of the program is the interpretation and implementation of the HIPAA standards for privacy and security.

	At December&nbsp;31, 2015, we had approximately 137,000 employees, including approximately 28,000 part-time employees. References herein to
	&#147;employees&#148; refer to employees of our affiliates. We are subject to various state and federal laws that regulate wages, hours, benefits and other terms and conditions relating to employment. At December&nbsp;31, 2015, certain employees at
	32 of our hospitals are represented by various labor unions. It is likely that union organizing efforts will take place at additional hospitals in the future. We consider our employee relations to be good and have not experienced work stoppages that
	have materially, adversely affected our business or results of operations. Our hospitals, like most hospitals, have experienced rising labor costs. In some markets, nurse and medical support personnel availability has become a significant operating
	issue to healthcare providers. To address this challenge, we have implemented several initiatives to improve retention, recruiting, compensation programs and productivity.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:2%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Our hospitals are staffed by licensed physicians, including both employed physicians and physicians who are not employees of our hospitals.
	Some physicians provide services in our hospitals under contracts, which generally describe a term of service, provide and establish the duties and obligations of such physicians, require the maintenance of certain performance criteria and fix
	compensation for such services. Any licensed physician may apply to be accepted to the medical staff of any of our hospitals, but the hospital&#146;s medical staff and the appropriate governing board of the hospital, in accordance with established
	credentialing criteria, must approve acceptance to the staff. Members of the medical staffs of our hospitals often also serve on the medical staffs of other hospitals and may terminate their affiliation with one of our hospitals at any time.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:2%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	We may be required to continue to enhance wages and benefits to recruit and retain nurses and other medical support personnel or to hire more
	expensive temporary or contract personnel. As a result, our labor costs could increase. We also depend on the available labor pool of semi-skilled and unskilled employees in each of the markets in which we operate. Certain proposed changes in
	federal labor laws and the National Labor Relations Board&#146;s pending modification of its election procedures could increase the likelihood of employee unionization attempts. To the extent a significant portion of our employee base unionizes, our
	costs could increase significantly. In addition, the states in which we operate could adopt mandatory nurse-staffing ratios or could reduce mandatory nurse-staffing ratios already in place. State-mandated nurse-staffing ratios could significantly
	affect labor costs, and have an adverse impact on revenues if we are required to limit patient admissions in order to meet the required ratios.

	The healthcare industry is highly competitive among hospitals and other healthcare providers for patients,

	believe we are the sole provider of general acute care health services. As a result, the most significant competition our hospitals face typically comes from hospitals outside of our primary service areas, including hospitals in urban areas that
	provide more complex services. Patients in our primary service areas may travel to these other hospitals because of physician referrals or their need for services we do not offer, among other reasons. Patients who receive services from these other
	hospitals may subsequently shift their preferences to those hospitals for the services we provide. Competition for patients is also increasing among other healthcare providers, including outpatient surgery, orthopedic, oncology and diagnostic
	centers. Our hospitals and our competitors are implementing physician alignment strategies, such as acquiring physician practice groups, employing physicians and participating in ACOs or other clinical integration models, which may impact our
	competitive position.

	primary service areas. In most markets in which we are not the sole provider of general acute care health services, our primary competitor is a municipal or not-for-profit hospital. These hospitals are owned by tax-supported governmental agencies or
	not-for-profit entities supported by endowments and charitable contributions. They do not pay income or property taxes, and can make capital expenditures without paying sales tax. These financial advantages may better position these hospitals to
	maintain more modern and technologically upgraded facilities and equipment and offer services more specialized than those available at our hospitals. If our competitors are better able to attract patients with these offerings, we may experience an
	overall decline in patient volume.

	Trends toward clinical transparency and value-based purchasing may have an unanticipated impact on our
	competitive position and patient volumes. The CMS Hospital Compare website makes available to the public certain data that hospitals submit in connection with Medicare reimbursement claims, including performance data related to quality measures and
	patient satisfaction surveys. Federal law provides for the future expansion of the number of quality measures that must be reported. Further, every hospital must establish and update annually a public listing of the hospital&#146;s standard charges
	for items and services or publish its policies for allowing the public to view a list of these charges in response to an inquiry. If any of our hospitals achieve poor results (or results that are lower than our competitors) on these quality measures
	or on patient satisfaction surveys, or if our standard charges are higher than our competitors, we may attract fewer patients.

	The U.S. Congress and certain state legislatures have introduced and passed a large number of proposals and legislation designed to make major
	changes in the healthcare system, including changes that increase access to health insurance. In particular, the Reform Legislation mandates that substantially all U.S. citizens maintain medical insurance coverage and expands health insurance
	coverage through a combination of public program expansion and private sector health insurance reforms. Based on projections issued by the CBO in March 2015, the incremental insurance coverage due to the Reform Legislation could result in

	Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, or HITECH, eligible hospitals and healthcare professionals can receive incentive payments for their adoption and meaningful use of EHR technology. The implementation of EHR technology that meets the

	physicians, maintaining good relations with those physicians and controlling costs related to the employment of physicians. In many of the markets we serve, many physicians have admitting privileges at other healthcare facilities in addition to our
	healthcare facilities. Such physicians may terminate their affiliation with or employment by our healthcare facilities at any time. If we are unable to provide adequate support personnel or technologically advanced equipment and facilities that meet

	In addition to our physicians, the operations of our hospitals are dependent on the efforts, abilities and experience of our management and
	medical support personnel, such as nurses, pharmacists and lab technicians. We compete with other healthcare providers in recruiting and retaining qualified management and support personnel responsible for the daily operations of our hospitals,
	including nurses and other non-physician healthcare professionals. In some markets, the availability of nurses and other medical support personnel has been a significant operating issue to healthcare providers. We may be required to continue to
	enhance wages and benefits to recruit and retain nurses and other medical support personnel or to hire more expensive temporary or contract personnel. In addition, the states in which we operate could adopt mandatory nurse-staffing ratios or could
	reduce mandatory nurse-staffing ratios already in place. State-mandated nurse-staffing ratios could significantly affect labor costs and have an adverse impact on revenues if we are required to limit admissions in order to meet the required ratios.

	Increased or ongoing labor union activity is another factor that could adversely affect our labor costs or otherwise adversely impact us.
	To the extent a significant portion of our employee base unionizes, our labor costs could increase significantly. In addition, when negotiating collective bargaining agreements with unions, whether such agreements are renewals or first contracts,
	there is the possibility that strikes could occur during the negotiation process, and our continued operation during any strikes could increase our labor costs and otherwise adversely impact us.

	The trend toward value-based purchasing of healthcare services is gaining momentum
	across the healthcare industry among both government and commercial payors. Generally, value-based purchasing initiatives tie payment to the quality and efficiency of care. For example, hospital payments may be negatively impacted by the occurrence
	of HACs. As of federal fiscal year 2015, hospitals that fall into the top 25% of national risk-adjusted HAC rates for all hospitals in the previous year receive a 1% reduction in their total Medicare payments. Medicare does not reimburse for care
	related to HACs. In addition, federal funds may not be used under the Medicaid program to reimburse providers for services provided to treat HACs. Hospitals that experience excess readmissions for designated conditions receive reduced payments for
	all inpatient discharges. HHS also reduces Medicare inpatient hospital payments for all discharges by a required percentage and pools the amount collected

	HHS has indicated that it is particularly focused on tying Medicare payments to quality or

	April 2016, HHS will require hospitals in certain geographic areas to participate in a bundled payment program for specified joint replacement procedures, and HHS may increasingly establish similar mandatory programs. It is unclear whether
	alternative payment models will successfully coordinate care and reduce costs or whether they will decrease aggregate reimbursement. Several of the nation&#146;s largest commercial payors have also expressed an intent to increase reliance on
	value-based reimbursement arrangements. Further, many large commercial payors require hospitals to report quality data, and several commercial payors do not reimburse hospitals for certain preventable adverse events.

	From time to time, we receive inquiries or
	subpoenas from state regulators, state Medicaid Fraud Control units, fiscal intermediaries, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services and the Department of Justice regarding various Medicare and Medicaid issues. In addition to the matters
	discussed below, we are currently responding to subpoenas and administrative demands concerning (a)&nbsp;certain cardiology procedures, medical records and policies at a New Mexico hospital, (b)&nbsp;a civil investigative demand concerning
	cardiology devices at a Pennsylvania hospital, (c)&nbsp;an inquiry regarding a sleep lab at a Louisiana hospital, (d)&nbsp;a subpoena regarding wound care services at one of our Florida hospitals (which appears to be related to the recently unsealed
	case styled U.S. ex rel. Van Raalte, v. Healogics, Inc.), (e)&nbsp;a subpoena concerning provider based billing status for hyperbaric oxygen therapy at one of our Tennessee hospitals and (f)&nbsp;a civil investigative demand concerning neonatal
	services at one of our Washington hospitals. In addition, we are subject to other claims and lawsuits arising in the ordinary course of our business. Based on current knowledge, management does not believe that loss contingencies arising from
	pending legal, regulatory and governmental matters, including the matters described herein, will have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial position or liquidity of the Company. However, in light of the inherent uncertainties
	involved in pending legal, regulatory and governmental matters, some of which are beyond our control, and the very large or indeterminate damages sought in some of these matters, an adverse outcome in one or more of these matters could be material
	to our results of operations or cash flows for any particular reporting period. Settlements of suits involving Medicare and Medicaid issues routinely require both monetary payments as well as corporate integrity agreements. Additionally, qui tam or
	&#147;whistleblower&#148; actions initiated under the civil False Claims Act may be pending but placed under seal by the court to comply with the False Claims Act&#146;s requirements for filing such suits. In September 2014, the Criminal Division of
	the United States Department of Justice, or DOJ, announced that all qui tam cases will be shared with their Division to determine if a parallel criminal investigation should be opened. The Criminal Division has also frequently stated an intention to
	pursue corporations in criminal prosecutions. From time to time, we detect issues of non-compliance with Federal healthcare laws pertaining to claims submission and reimbursement practices and/or financial relationships with physicians. We avail
	ourselves of various mechanisms to address potential overpayments arising out of these issues, including repayment of claims, rebilling of claims, and participation in voluntary disclosure protocols offered by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid
	Services and the Office of the Inspector General. Participating in voluntary repayments and voluntary disclosure protocols can have the potential for significant settlement obligations or even enforcement action.

	Class Action
	Shareholder Federal Securities Cases
</U>
	. Three purported class action cases have been filed in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Tennessee; namely, Norfolk County Retirement System v. Community Health Systems, Inc., et
	al., filed May&nbsp;9, 2011; De Zheng v. Community Health Systems, Inc., et al., filed May&nbsp;12, 2011; and Minneapolis Firefighters Relief Association v. Community Health Systems, Inc., et al., filed June&nbsp;21, 2011. All three seek class
	certification on behalf of purchasers of our common stock between July&nbsp;27, 2006 and April&nbsp;11, 2011 and allege that misleading statements resulted in artificially inflated prices for our common stock. In December 2011, the cases were
	consolidated for pretrial purposes and NYC Funds and its counsel were selected as lead plaintiffs/lead plaintiffs&#146; counsel. In lieu of ruling on our motion to dismiss, the court permitted the plaintiffs to file a first amended consolidated
	class action complaint which was filed on October&nbsp;5, 2015. Our motion to dismiss was filed on November&nbsp;4, 2015 and is scheduled for oral argument on April&nbsp;11, 2016. The court also lifted the discovery stay and discovery is underway.
	We believe this consolidated matter is without merit and will vigorously defend this case.

	Shareholder Derivative Actions

	. Three
	purported shareholder derivative actions have also been filed in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Tennessee; Plumbers and Pipefitters Local Union No.&nbsp;630 Pension Annuity Trust Fund v. Wayne T. Smith, et al., filed
	May&nbsp;24, 2011; Roofers Local No.&nbsp;149 Pension Fund v. Wayne T. Smith, et al., filed June&nbsp;21, 2011; and Lambert Sweat v. Wayne T. Smith, et al., filed October&nbsp;5, 2011. These three cases allege breach of fiduciary duty arising out of
	allegedly improper inpatient admission practices, mismanagement, waste and unjust enrichment. These cases have been consolidated into a single, consolidated action. The plaintiffs filed an operative amended derivative complaint in these three
	consolidated actions on March&nbsp;15, 2012. Our motion to dismiss was argued on June&nbsp;13, 2013. On September&nbsp;27, 2013, the court issued an order granting in part and denying in part our motion to dismiss. An initial case management order
	was entered on November&nbsp;11, 2014, but no trial date has been set. Discovery is continuing. We believe all of the plaintiffs&#146; claims are without merit and will vigorously defend them.

	On February&nbsp;4, 2014, a redacted case then styled (Sealed Party) v. Pottstown Hospital Co., LLC d/b/a Pottstown Memorial Medical Center
	and Community Health Systems, Inc. was filed in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania. On May&nbsp;6, 2014, the district court ordered the seal lifted. The relator is Alan E. Cooper, M.D. The complaint alleges the hospital traded on call agreements
	for referrals. There is no indication that the DOJ has intervened in this matter. This matter was previously reported in prior filings in the Legal Proceedings section as subpoenas to two Pennsylvania hospitals and one of our subsidiaries concerning
	on call agreements and physician directorships. On June&nbsp;5, 2014, we filed motions to dismiss the complaint and on June&nbsp;30, 2014 the relator filed his response. Oral argument occurred on October&nbsp;15, 2014 and the matter was taken under
	advisement and discovery was stayed. Our motions to dismiss were granted with prejudice on March&nbsp;13, 2015; the relator filed an appeal and oral argument on the appeal was originally set for November&nbsp;20, 2015 but by order of the court was
	submitted on paper only. We are awaiting a decision. We will continue to vigorously defend this matter.

	Cyber Attack.
</U>
</I>
	As previously disclosed on a Current Report on Form 8-K filed by us on August&nbsp;18, 2014, our computer network
	was the target of an external, criminal cyber-attack that we believe occurred between April and June, 2014. We and Mandiant (a FireEye Company), the forensic expert engaged by us in connection with this matter, believe the attacker was a foreign
	&#147;Advanced Persistent Threat&#148; group who used highly sophisticated malware and technology to attack our systems. The attacker was able to bypass our security measures and successfully copy and transfer outside the Company certain non-medical
	patient identification data (such as patient names, addresses, birthdates, telephone numbers and social security numbers), but not including patient credit card, medical or clinical information. We continue to work closely with federal law
	enforcement authorities in connection with their investigation and possible prosecution of those determined to be responsible for this attack. Mandiant has conducted a thorough investigation of this incident and continues to advise the Company
	regarding security and monitoring efforts. We are providing appropriate notification to affected patients and regulatory agencies as required by federal and state law. We are offering identity theft protection services to individuals affected by
	this attack.

	We have incurred certain expenses to remediate and investigate this matter, and expect to continue to incur expenses of this
	nature in the foreseeable future. In addition, multiple purported class action lawsuits have been filed against the Company and certain subsidiaries. These lawsuits allege that sensitive information was unprotected and inadequately encrypted by the
	Company. The plaintiffs claim breach of contract and other theories of recovery, and are seeking damages, as well as restitution for any identity theft. On February&nbsp;4, 2015, the United States Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation ordered
	the transfer of the purported class actions pending outside of the District Court for the Northern District of Alabama to the District Court for the Northern District of Alabama for coordinated or consolidated pretrial proceedings. A consolidated
	complaint was filed and we filed a motion to dismiss on September&nbsp;21, 2015, which was partially argued on February&nbsp;10, 2016. In an oral ruling from the bench, the court greatly limited the potential class by ruling only plaintiffs with
	specific injury resulting from the breach had standing to sue. Further, on jurisdictional grounds, the court dismissed Community Health Systems, Inc. from all non-Tennessee based cases. Finally, the court set April&nbsp;15, 2016 for further argument
	on whether the remaining plaintiffs have sufficiently stated a cause of action to continue their cases. At this time, we are unable to predict the outcome of this litigation or determine the potential impact, if any, that could result from this
	litigation, but we intend to vigorously defend these lawsuits. This matter may subject the Company to additional litigation, potential governmental inquiries, potential reputational damage, and additional remediation, operating and other expenses.

	On
	January&nbsp;11, 2010, HMA and one of its subsidiaries were named in a qui tam lawsuit entitled
<I>
	U.S. ex rel. J.&nbsp;Michael Mastej v. Health Management Associates, Inc. et al.
</I>
	in the United States District Court for the Middle District of
	Florida, Tampa Division. The plaintiff&#146;s complaint alleged that, among other things, the defendants erroneously submitted claims to Medicare and that those claims were falsely certified to be in compliance with Section&nbsp;1877 of the Social
	Security Act of 1935 (commonly known as the &#147;Stark law&#148;) and the Anti-Kickback Statute. The plaintiff&#146;s complaint further alleged that the defendants&#146; conduct violated the False Claims Act. The plaintiff seeks recovery of all
	Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement that the defendants received as a result of the alleged false certifications and treble damages under the False Claims Act, as well as a civil penalty for each Medicare and Medicaid claim supported by such alleged
	false certifications. On August&nbsp;18, 2010, the plaintiff filed a first amended complaint that was similar to the original complaint. On February&nbsp;23, 2011, the case was transferred to the United States District Court for the Middle District
	of Florida, Fort Myers Division. On May&nbsp;5, 2011, the plaintiff filed a second amended complaint, which was similar to the first amended complaint. On May&nbsp;17, 2011, the defendants moved to dismiss the second amended complaint for failure to
	state a claim with the particularity required and failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. On January&nbsp;26, 2012, the United States gave notice of its decision not to intervene in this lawsuit. On February&nbsp;16, 2012, the
	court granted the defendants&#146; motion to dismiss, without prejudice. The court&#146;s order permitted the plaintiff to file an amended complaint. On March&nbsp;8, 2012, the plaintiff filed a third amended complaint, which was similar to the
	first amended complaint and the second amended complaint. On March&nbsp;26, 2012, the defendants moved to dismiss the third amended complaint on the same bases set forth in earlier motions to dismiss. On March&nbsp;19, 2013, the United States
	District Court for the Middle District of Florida, Tampa Division, dismissed the third amended complaint with prejudice. On March&nbsp;28, 2013, the United States of America filed a motion to clarify that the dismissal with prejudice did not relate
	to the United States. On April&nbsp;4, 2013, the defendants filed an opposition to the United States&#146; motion for clarification. The Government&#146;s motion remains pending at this time. The case was appealed by Mastej to the Eleventh Circuit
	Court of Appeals and on October&nbsp;30, 2014 the appellate court affirmed the dismissal of part of the case and reversed the dismissal of part of the case. The relator sought further relief from the United States Supreme Court, which was denied on
	June&nbsp;1, 2015. The case has been remanded to the district court and has been set for trial during the November&nbsp;1, 2016 trial term. We intend to vigorously defend HMA and its subsidiary against the allegations in this matter.

	amended consolidated complaint (i)&nbsp;alleges that HMA made false and misleading statements in certain public disclosures regarding its business and financial results and (ii)&nbsp;asserts claims for violations of Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the

	voluntary compliance program, including its auditing and monitoring functions and confidential disclosure program. In recent years, the voluntary compliance program has addressed the potential for a variety of billing errors that might be the
	subject of audits and payment denials by the CMS Recovery Audit Contractors&#146; permanent project, including MS-DRG coding, outpatient hospital and physician coding and billing, and medical necessity for services (including a focus on hospital
	stays of very short duration). Efforts by management, through the voluntary compliance program, to identify and limit risk from these government audits have included significant policy and guidance revisions, training and education, and auditing.
	The Board of Directors now oversees and reviews periodic reports of the Company&#146;s compliance with the Corporate Integrity Agreement, or CIA, that the Company entered into with the United States Department of Health and Human Services Office of
	the Inspector General during 2014.

	For the past several years, our Board of Directors has met monthly to review the status of the
	lawsuits and investigations relating to allegations of improper billing for inpatient care at our hospitals and to oversee management in connection with our investigation and defense of these matters. Following the consummation of the HMA merger,
	these meetings have been expanded to include the review and oversight of the legal proceedings related to HMA that are covered by the CVR. The independent members of our Board of Directors remain fully engaged in the oversight of these matters.

	The Company is a holding company which operates through its subsidiaries. Our Credit Facility and the

	With the exception of a special cash dividend of $0.25 per share paid by us in December 2012, historically, we have not
	paid any cash dividends. Subject to certain exceptions, our Credit Facility limits the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends and make distributions to us, and limits our ability to pay dividends and/or repurchase stock, to an amount not to
	exceed $200 million in the aggregate plus an additional $25 million in any particular year plus the aggregate amount of proceeds from the exercise of stock options. The indentures governing the senior and senior secured notes also restrict our
	subsidiaries from, among other matters, paying dividends and making distributions to us, which thereby limits our ability to pay dividends and/or repurchase stock. As of December 31, 2015, under the most restrictive test under these agreements (and
	subject to certain exceptions), we have approximately $318 million remaining available with which to pay permitted dividends and/or repurchase shares of our stock or our senior and senior secured notes.

	approximately $19.4 billion compared to approximately $18.6 billion for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2014. Our provision for bad debts increased to $3.127 billion, or 13.9% of operating revenues (before the provision for bad debts) for the year
	ended December&nbsp;31, 2015, from $2.922 billion, or 13.6% of operating revenues (before the provision for bad debts) for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2014. Included in the increase to the provision for bad debts is a $169 million change in

	As the number of persons with access to health insurance in the United States increases, there may be a resulting increase in the number of
	patients using our facilities who have health insurance coverage. We operate hospitals in eight of the 10 states that experienced the largest reductions in uninsured rates among adult residents between 2013 and 2015. Most of these states with the
	greatest reductions in the number of uninsured adult residents have established a health insurance exchange operated either by the state or in partnership with the federal government and also expanded Medicaid. However, states may opt out of the
	Medicaid coverage expansion provisions of the Reform Legislation without losing existing federal Medicaid funding. A number of states have opted out of the Medicaid coverage expansion provisions, but could ultimately decide to expand their programs
	at a later date. Of the 28 states in which we operate hospitals that are included in continuing operations, 15 states have taken action to expand their Medicaid programs, including Louisiana, which is expected to implement Medicaid coverage
	expansion at some point in 2016. At this time, the other 13 states have not, including Florida, Tennessee and Texas, where we operated a significant number of hospitals as of December&nbsp;31, 2015. Some states that have opted out are evaluating
	options such as waiver plans to operate an alternative Medicaid expansion plan. Failure to expand Medicaid or implement an effective alternative in these states will likely have a negative impact on the goal of reducing the number of uninsured
	individuals.

	The Reform Legislation includes provisions aimed at reducing fraud, waste and abuse in the healthcare industry. These provisions allocate
	significant additional resources to federal enforcement agencies and expand the use of private contractors to recover potentially inappropriate Medicare and Medicaid payments. The Reform Legislation amends several existing federal laws, including
	the anti-kickback statute and the False Claims Act, to make it easier for government agencies and private plaintiffs to prevail in lawsuits brought against healthcare providers. These amendments also make it easier for potentially severe fines and
	penalties to be imposed on healthcare providers that violate applicable laws and regulations.

	We believe the expansion of private sector

	operations during 2014 and 2015 as the result of the expansion of private sector and Medicaid coverage that has already occurred from the Reform Legislation and we believe that the net impact of the Reform Legislation on our net operating revenues
	will continue to be positive. Other provisions of the Reform Legislation, such as requirements related to employee health insurance coverage, have increased and will continue to increase our operating costs.

	Payment under the Medicare program for physician services, which is based upon the Medicare Physician Fee Schedule, or MPFS, changed in April

	for a 0.5% update to the MPFS for each calendar year through 2019. In addition, MACRA requires the establishment of the Merit-Based Incentive Payment System, or MIPS, beginning in 2019, under which physicians will receive performance-based payment
	incentives or payment reductions based on their performance with respect to clinical quality, resource use, clinical improvement activities, and meaningful use of electronic health records. MIPS will consolidate certain existing physician incentive

	As shown above, we receive a substantial portion of our revenues from the Medicare and Medicaid programs.
	Included in Managed Care and other third-party payors is operating revenues from insurance companies with which we have insurance provider contracts, Medicare managed care, insurance companies for which we do not have insurance provider contracts,
	workers&#146; compensation carriers and non-patient service revenue, such as rental income and cafeteria sales. In the future, we generally expect revenues received from the Medicare and Medicaid programs to increase due to the general aging of the
	population. In addition, the Reform Legislation has increased and is expected to continue to increase the number of insured patients in states that have expanded Medicaid, which in turn, has reduced and is expected to continue to reduce the
	percentage of revenues from self-pay patients. The Reform Legislation, however, imposes significant reductions in amounts the government pays Medicare managed care plans. The trend toward increased enrollment in Medicare managed care may adversely
	affect our operating revenue growth. Other provisions in the Reform Legislation impose minimum medical-loss ratios and require insurers to meet specific benefit requirements. Furthermore, in the normal course of business, managed care programs,
	insurance companies and employers actively negotiate the amounts paid to hospitals. The trend toward increased enrollment in managed care may adversely affect our operating revenue growth. There can be no assurance that we will retain our existing
	reimbursement arrangements or that these third-party payors will not attempt to further reduce the rates they pay for our services.

	Net
	operating revenues include amounts estimated by management to be reimbursable by Medicare and Medicaid under prospective payment systems and provisions of cost-based reimbursement and other payment methods. In addition, we are reimbursed by
	non-governmental payors using a variety of payment methodologies. Amounts we receive for the treatment of patients covered by Medicare, Medicaid and non-governmental payors are generally less than the standard billing rates. We account for the
	differences between the estimated program reimbursement rates and the standard billing rates as contractual allowance adjustments, which we deduct from gross revenues to arrive at net operating revenues. Final settlements under some of these
	programs are subject to adjustment based on administrative review and audit by third parties. We account for adjustments to previous program reimbursement estimates as contractual allowance adjustments and report them in the periods that such
	adjustments become known. Contractual allowance adjustments related to final settlements and previous program reimbursement estimates impacted net operating revenues and net income by an insignificant amount in each of the years ended
	December&nbsp;31, 2015, 2014 and 2013.

	2015, CMS published the final rule to increase this index by 2.4% for hospital inpatient acute care services that are reimbursed under the prospective payment system, beginning October&nbsp;1,
	2015. The final rule also makes other payment adjustments that, coupled with the 0.8% reduction for documentation and coding, a 0.5% multifactor productivity reduction, and a 0.2% reduction to hospital inpatient rates implemented pursuant to the
	Reform Legislation, yielded an estimated net 0.9% increase in reimbursement for hospitals. For fiscal year 2016, an additional reduction applies to hospitals that do not submit required patient quality data. We are complying with this data
	submission requirement.

	Payments may also be affected by admission and medical review criteria for inpatient services commonly known as
	the &#147;two midnight rule.&#148; Under the rule, for admissions on or after October&nbsp;1, 2013, services to Medicare beneficiaries are only payable as inpatient hospital services when there is a reasonable expectation that the hospital care is
	medically necessary and will be required across two midnights, absent unusual circumstances. Stays expected to need less than two midnights of hospital care are subject to medical review on a case-by-case basis. Enforcement through Recovery Audit
	Contractor audits is expected to begin in 2016. Reductions in the rate of increase or overall reductions in Medicare reimbursement may cause a decline in the growth of our net operating revenues.

	Currently, several states utilize supplemental reimbursement programs for the purpose of providing reimbursement to providers to offset a
	portion of the cost of providing care to Medicaid and indigent patients. These programs are designed with input from CMS and are funded with a combination of state and federal resources, including, in certain instances, fees or taxes levied on the
	providers. Similar programs are also being considered by other states. The programs are generally authorized for a specified period of time and require CMS&#146;s approval to be extended. CMS has indicated that it will take into account a
	state&#146;s status with respect to expanding its Medicaid program in considering whether to extend these supplemental programs. We are unable to predict whether or on what terms CMS will extend the supplemental programs in the states in which we
	operate, including Texas. Some of these programs are scheduled to expire in 2016. As a result of existing supplemental programs, we recognize revenue and related expenses in the period in which amounts are estimable and collection is reasonably
	assured. Reimbursement under these programs is reflected in net operating revenues and included as Medicaid revenue in the table above, and fees, taxes or other program related costs are reflected in other operating expenses.

	Our hospitals
	offer a variety of services involving a broad range of inpatient and outpatient medical and surgical services. These include general acute care, emergency room, general and specialty surgery, critical care, internal medicine, obstetrics, diagnostic
	services, psychiatric and rehabilitation services. The strongest demand for hospital services generally occurs during January through April and the weakest demand for these services occurs during the summer months. Accordingly, eliminating the
	effect of new acquisitions, our net operating revenues and earnings are historically highest during the first quarter and lowest during the third quarter. Same-store operating results include the hospitals acquired in the HMA merger. For the
	hospitals acquired in the HMA merger, the same-store information for the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2015 and 2014 reflects the periods from January&nbsp;1 through December&nbsp;31, 2015 and 2014, as if such hospitals were owned during both
	comparable periods. For all hospitals owned throughout both periods, the same-store information reflects the indicated periods. The same-store information reflected below does not reflect the application of purchase accounting adjustments as if the
	HMA merger had been completed on January&nbsp;1, 2014. Therefore, this information is not intended to present pro forma information prepared under the guidelines of Articles 3-05 and 11 of the Securities and Exchange Commission. However, management
	believes the information provides investors with useful information about hospital admissions, adjusted admissions and net operating revenues had the HMA facilities been owned for the indicated periods. This same-store information for the hospitals
	acquired in the HMA merger for the period from January&nbsp;1 through December&nbsp;31, 2014 is non-GAAP financial information and may not be comparable to the information provided for the comparable 2015 period due to the aforementioned purchase
	accounting adjustments not having been applied.

	Net operating revenues increased by 4.3% to approximately $19.4&nbsp;billion for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2015, from approximately
	$18.6&nbsp;billion for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2014. Our provision for bad debts increased to $3.127 billion, or 13.9% of operating revenues (before the provision for bad debts) for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2015, from $2.922
	billion, or 13.6% of operating revenues (before the provision for bad debts) for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2014. During the fourth quarter of 2015, we noted that two key indicators analyzed as part of the estimate for the allowance for
	doubtful accounts &#150; cash collections as a percentage of trailing twelve months revenue and days revenue outstanding &#150; had trended unfavorably since the end of the third quarter. We also updated our analysis of historical collection rates
	utilized in the estimate for the allowance for doubtful accounts, which revealed a deterioration in overall collectability of accounts receivable. As a result, we refined our estimate of the allowance for doubtful accounts and recorded an increase
	to the provision for bad debts, which has been accounted for as a change in estimate during the fourth quarter of 2015. We believe the increase in uncollectible accounts is the result of slightly lower benefits from healthcare reform compared to
	what was previously estimated and a deterioration in the quality of certain categories of self-pay accounts being pursued for collection by our in-house collection agency. These specific categories of self-pay accounts include decreases in
	collections of deductibles and co-pays, increases in personal bankruptcies, and declines in the growth of scheduled time payments.

	The
	$798 million increase in net operating revenues included $404 million of revenues related to the operations of the hospitals acquired in the HMA merger due to having an additional 26 days of operations for such hospitals during the year ended
	December&nbsp;31, 2015. In addition, net operating revenues from same-store hospitals, excluding hospitals acquired in the HMA merger, increased $434 million. These increases in revenue were offset by a decrease of $40 million in revenue related to
	non-same-store net operating revenue, primarily from the other four hospitals acquired in 2014 and impacted by the change in estimate of the provision for bad debts discussed above. On a same-store basis, net operating revenue increased 2.4% during
	the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2015 as compared to the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2014. The increase in same-store net operating revenues was attributable to favorable changes in payor mix with corresponding reductions in charity care and
	self-pay discounts as a percentage of revenue. On a consolidated basis, inpatient admissions increased by 1.7% and adjusted admissions increased by 3.5% during the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2015 as compared to the year ended December&nbsp;31,
	2014. On a same-store basis, net operating revenues per adjusted admissions increased 2.1%, while inpatient admissions decreased by 1.8% and adjusted admissions increased by 0.3% during the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2015 as compared to the year
	ended December&nbsp;31, 2014.

	Operating expenses as a percentage of net operating revenues increased from 92.8% during the year ended
	December&nbsp;31, 2014 to 93.1% during the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2015. Operating expenses, excluding depreciation and amortization and impairment of long-lived assets, as a percentage of net operating revenues, increased from 86.3% for the
	year ended December&nbsp;31, 2014 to 86.8% for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2015. Salaries and benefits, as a percentage of net operating revenues, increased from 46.2% for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2014 to 46.3% for the year ended
	December&nbsp;31, 2015. This increase in salaries and benefits, as a percentage of net operating revenues, was primarily due to annual merit increases and increases in physician employment, offset by increased productivity during 2015. Supplies, as
	a percentage of net operating revenues, increased from 15.4% for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2014 to 15.7% for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2015, primarily as a result of an increase in drug costs over the prior year. Other operating
	expenses, as a percentage of net operating revenues, decreased from 23.3% for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2014 to 23.2% for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2015. This decrease in other operating expenses, as a percentage of net operating
	revenues, was primarily due to decreases in expenses related to achieving meaningful use compliance and acquisition and integration-related expenses, primarily related to the HMA merger. Government settlement and related costs, as a percentage of
	net revenues, was 0.5% for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2014. There was a nominal amount of government settlement and related costs for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2015. Rent, as a percentage of net operating revenues, increased from 2.3%

	Depreciation and amortization as a percentage

	Impairment for long-lived assets increased by $27 million to $68 million in the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2015 compared to $41 million for
	the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2014. Included in this $68 million amount was an impairment charge of approximately $6 million related to the reporting unit goodwill allocated to one hospital sold during the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2015 and
	$62 million related to the impairment of certain long-lived assets for several smaller hospitals recorded in the quarter ended December&nbsp;31, 2015. These hospitals were identified as having permanent indicators of impairment due to a history of
	negative operating results and declining volumes, resulting in a decline in projections of future cash flows and estimated fair values. During the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2014, in connection with the HMA merger, we further analyzed our
	intangible assets related to internal-use software used in certain of our hospitals for patient and clinical systems, including software required to meet criteria for meaningful use attestation and ICD-10 compliance. This analysis resulted in
	management reassessing its usage of certain software products and rationalizing that, with the addition of the HMA hospitals in the first quarter of 2014, those software applications were going to be discontinued and replaced with new applications
	that better integrate meaningful use and ICD-10 compliance, are more cost effective and can be implemented at a greater efficiency of scale over future implementations. Because of this decision by management, an impairment charge of approximately
	$24 million was recorded during the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2014. In addition, an impairment of $17 million was recorded during the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2014 on certain long-lived assets at two of our smaller hospitals due to a
	reduction in volumes in recent years resulting in a decline in projections of future cash flows and estimated fair values, and one hospital because of our decision to cease operating as an acute care hospital.

	approximately $1.6 billion for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2014. The $1.6 billion of cash flows from operations includes the cash payments of approximately $207 million related to payments associated with the acquisition and integration of HMA
	and payments related to government settlements, net of tax, which we do not consider part of our recurring operations. The increase in cash provided by operating activities is a result of the net impact of the decline in net income of $14 million,
	offset by a $404 million increase to depreciation and amortization and an increase of $145 million in the non-cash charges to income primarily related to the loss from early extinguishment of debt, the impairment of long-lived assets and hospitals
	sold or held for sale, and the charge in connection with the agreement in principle to settle claims at our New Mexico hospitals and related costs. Cash from operating activities also had a decline in working capital items of approximately $22
	million, net of the effect of acquired balances from the HMA merger and other acquisitions and divestitures. Total cash paid for interest during the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2014 was approximately $831 million and approximately $180 million was
	received as net refunds for income taxes. Included in net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2014 is $253 million of cash received for HITECH incentive reimbursements, compared to $203 million for the year

	ended December&nbsp;31, 2013 to approximately $4.4 billion for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2014. The increase in cash used in investing activities was due to an increase in cash paid for acquisitions of facilities and other related equipment of
	$3.0 billion as a result of the acquisition of HMA (which owned and operated 71 hospitals at the time of the completion of the HMA merger) and three additional hospitals in 2014 compared to no hospital acquisitions in 2013, an increase in the cash
	used for the purchase of property and equipment of $239 million, the net impact of the purchases and sales of available-for-sale securities of $34 million and an increase in cash used for other investments of $171 million. These increases were
	offset by an increase in the proceeds from sale of property and equipment of $43 million and the proceeds from disposition of hospitals and other ancillary operations of $88 million. Included in cash outflows for other investments for the year ended
	December&nbsp;31, 2014 is approximately $274 million of capital expenditures related to the purchase and implementation of certified EHR technology, including implementation of Cerner software at several hospital locations. The remaining cash

	financing activities of $113 million for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2013. The increase in cash provided by financing activities, in comparison to the prior year, is primarily due to an increase in our long-term borrowings and issuance of
	long-term debt totaling $11.9 billion, but was mostly offset by an increase in the repayments of our long-term debt of $8.4 billion. These increases were offset by a reduction in the proceeds from the exercise of stock options of $45 million, an
	increase in deferred financing costs and other debt-related costs of $263 million, an increase in the redemption of noncontrolling investments in joint ventures of $149 million and a reduction in proceeds from receivables facility of $134 million.

	We have senior secured financing under a credit facility with a syndicate of financial institutions led by Credit Suisse, as administrative
	agent and collateral agent. In connection with the HMA merger, we and CHS/Community Health Systems, Inc., or CHS, entered into a third amendment and restatement of its Credit Facility, providing for additional financing and recapitalization of
	certain of our term loans, including (i)&nbsp;the replacement of the revolving credit facility with a new $1.0 billion revolving facility maturing in 2019, or Revolving Facility, (ii)&nbsp;the addition of a new $1.0 billion Term A facility due 2019,
	or the Term A Facility, (iii)&nbsp;a Term D facility in an aggregate principal amount equal to approximately $4.6 billion due 2021 (which included certain term C loans that were converted into such Term D facility (collectively, the Term D
	Facility)), (iv)&nbsp;the conversion of certain term C loans into Term E Loans and the borrowing of new Term E Loans in an aggregate principal amount of approximately $1.7 billion due 2017 and (v)&nbsp;the addition of flexibility commensurate with
	the our post-acquisition structure. In addition to funding a portion of the consideration in connection with the HMA merger, some of the proceeds of the Term A Facility and Term D Facility were used to refinance the outstanding $637 million existing
	term A facility due 2016 and the $60 million of term B loans due 2014, respectively. The Revolving Facility includes a subfacility for letters of credit. On March&nbsp;9, 2015, CHS entered into Amendment No.&nbsp;1 and Incremental Term Loan
	Assumption Agreement to refinance the existing Term E Loans due 2017 into Term F Loans due 2018, in an original aggregated principal amount of $1.7 billion. On May&nbsp;18, 2015, CHS entered into an Incremental Term Loan Assumption Agreement to
	provide for a new $1.6 billion incremental Term G facility and a new approximately $2.9 billion incremental Term H facility. The proceeds of the Term G facility and Term H facility were used to repay the Company&#146;s existing Term D facility in

	On March&nbsp;21, 2012, through certain of its subsidiaries, CHS entered into an accounts receivable loan agreement,
	or the Receivables Facility, with a group of lenders and banks, Credit Agricol&eacute; Corporate and Investment Bank, as a managing agent and as the administrative agent, and The Bank of Nova Scotia, as a managing agent. On March&nbsp;7, 2013, CHS
	and certain of its subsidiaries amended the Receivables Facility to add an additional managing agent, The Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ, Ltd., to increase the size of the facility from $300 million to $500 million and to extend the scheduled
	termination date. Additional subsidiaries also agreed to participate in the Receivables Facility as of that date. On March&nbsp;31, 2014, CHS and certain of its subsidiaries amended the Receivables Facility to increase the size of the facility from
	$500 million to $700 million and to extend the scheduled termination date. Additional subsidiaries also agreed to participate in the Receivables Facility as of that date. On November&nbsp;13, 2015, CHS and certain of its subsidiaries amended the
	Receivables Facility to extend the scheduled termination date and amend certain other provisions thereof. The existing and future non-self pay patient-related accounts receivable, or the Receivables, for certain hospitals of CHS and its subsidiaries
	serve as collateral for the outstanding borrowings under the Receivables Facility. The interest rate on the borrowings is based on the commercial paper rate plus an applicable interest rate spread. Unless earlier terminated or subsequently extended
	pursuant to its terms, the Receivables Facility will expire on November&nbsp;13, 2017, subject to customary termination events that could cause an early termination date. CHS maintains effective control over the Receivables because, pursuant to the
	terms of the Receivables Facility, the Receivables are sold from certain of CHS&#146; subsidiaries to CHS, and CHS then sells or contributes the Receivables to a special-purpose entity that is wholly-owned by CHS. The wholly-owned special-purpose
	entity in turn grants security interests in the Receivables in exchange for borrowings obtained from the group of third-party lenders and banks of up to $700 million outstanding from time to time based on the availability of eligible Receivables and
	other customary factors. The group of third-party lenders and banks do not have recourse to CHS or its subsidiaries beyond the assets of the wholly-owned special-purpose entity that collateralizes the loan. The Receivables and other assets of the
	wholly-owned special-purpose entity will be available first and foremost to satisfy the claims of the creditors of such entity. The outstanding borrowings pursuant to the Receivables Facility at December&nbsp;31, 2015 totaled $700 million and are
	classified as long-term debt on the consolidated balance sheet. At December&nbsp;31, 2015, the carrying amount of Receivables included in the Receivables Facility totaled approximately $1.7 billion and is included in patient accounts receivable on
	the consolidated balance sheet.

	We have sold

	from less than 1% to 40%. We do not believe the minority ownership interests acquired in the HMA merger are material to our financial position or results of operations. In addition, effective November&nbsp;1, 2014, we acquired from Novant Health,
	Inc. its 30% noncontrolling interest in Lake Norman Regional Medical Center for $150 million pursuant to a change in control provision in the operating agreement that was triggered with the HMA merger. As of December&nbsp;31, 2015, we have hospitals
	in 29&nbsp;of the markets we serve, with noncontrolling physician ownership interests ranging from less than 1% to 40%, including one hospital that also has a non-profit entity as a partner. In addition, we have 9 other hospitals with noncontrolling
	interests owned by non-profit entities. Redeemable noncontrolling interests in equity of consolidated subsidiaries was $571 million and $531 million as of December&nbsp;31, 2015 and December&nbsp;31, 2014, respectively, and noncontrolling interests
	in equity of consolidated subsidiaries was $86 million and $80 million as of December&nbsp;31, 2015 and December&nbsp;31, 2014, respectively. The amount of net income attributable to noncontrolling interests was $101 million, $111 million and $76
	million for the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. As a result of the change in the Stark Law &#147;whole hospital&#148; exception included in the Reform Legislation, we are not permitted to introduce physician

	Ongoing legislative and regulatory efforts could reduce or otherwise adversely affect the payments we receive from Medicare and Medicaid.
	Within the statutory framework of the Medicare and Medicaid programs, including programs currently unaffected by the Reform Legislation, there are substantial areas subject to administrative rulings, interpretations and discretion which may further
	affect payments made under those programs, and the federal and state governments might, in the future, reduce the funds available under those programs or require more stringent utilization and quality reviews of hospital facilities. Additionally,
	there may be a continued rise in managed care programs and additional restructuring of the financing and delivery of healthcare in the United States. These events could cause our future financial results to decline. We cannot estimate the impact of
	Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement changes that have been enacted or are under consideration. We cannot predict whether additional reimbursement reductions will be made or whether any such changes would have a material adverse effect on our

	Net
	operating revenues include amounts estimated by management to be reimbursable by Medicare and Medicaid under prospective payment systems and provisions of cost-reimbursement and other payment methods. In addition, we are reimbursed by
	non-governmental payors using a variety of payment methodologies. Amounts we receive for treatment of patients covered by these programs are generally less than the standard billing rates. Contractual allowances are automatically calculated and
	recorded through our internally developed &#147;automated contractual allowance system.&#148; Within the automated system, payors&#146; historical paid claims data are utilized to calculate the contractual allowances. This data is automatically
	updated on a monthly basis. All hospital contractual allowance calculations are subjected to monthly review by management to ensure reasonableness and accuracy. We account for the differences between the estimated program reimbursement rates and the
	standard billing rates as contractual allowance adjustments, which we deduct from gross revenues to arrive at operating revenues (net of contractual allowances and discounts). The process of estimating contractual allowances requires us to estimate
	the amount expected to be received based on payor contract provisions. The key assumption in this process is the estimated contractual reimbursement percentage, which is based on payor classification and historical paid claims data. Our automated
	contractual allowance system does not maintain the contractual allowance at the patient account level as it estimates an average contractual allowance by payor classification. Due to the complexities involved in these estimates, actual payments we
	receive could be different from the amounts we estimate and record. If the actual contractual reimbursement percentage under government programs and managed care contracts differed by 1% at December&nbsp;31, 2015 from our estimated reimbursement
	percentage, net income for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2015 would have changed by approximately $79 million, and net accounts receivable at December&nbsp;31, 2015 would have changed by $129 million. Final settlements under some of these
	programs are subject to adjustment based on administrative review and audit by third parties. We account for adjustments to previous program reimbursement estimates as contractual allowance adjustments and report them in the periods that such
	adjustments become known. Contractual allowance adjustments related to final settlements and previous program reimbursement estimates impacted net operating revenues and net income by an insignificant amount in each of the years ended
	December&nbsp;31, 2015, 2014 and 2013.

	Goodwill represents the excess of the fair value of the consideration conveyed in the acquisition over the fair value of net assets acquired.
	Goodwill is evaluated for impairment at the same time every year and when an event occurs or circumstances change that, more likely than not, reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying value. There is a two-step method for
	determining goodwill impairment. Step one is to compare the fair value of the reporting unit with the unit&#146;s carrying amount, including goodwill. If this test indicates the fair value is less than the carrying value, then step two is required

	At

	reporting unit. We performed our last annual goodwill evaluation during the fourth quarter of 2015. No impairment was indicated by this evaluation, however, a decline in our stock price during the fourth quarter and lower projections of future
	discounted cash flows reduced the excess of fair value over the carrying value of our hospital operations reporting unit to approximately $1 billion. This decline in the excess fair value over carrying value of our hospital operations reporting unit
	increases the risk that future declines in fair value could result in goodwill impairment. The determination of fair value in step one of our goodwill impairment analysis is based on an estimate of fair value for each reporting unit utilizing known
	and estimated inputs at the evaluation date. Some of those inputs include, but are not limited to, the most recent price of our common stock, estimates of future revenue and expense growth, expected capital expenditures, income tax rates, and costs
	of invested capital. Future estimates of fair value could be adversely affected if the actual outcome of one or more of these assumptions changes materially in the future, including a decline in our stock price, lower than expected hospital volumes,

	As part of our business of owning and operating hospitals, we are subject to legal actions alleging liability on our part. We accrue for
	losses resulting from such liability claims, as well as loss adjustment expenses that are out-of-pocket and directly related to such liability claims. These direct out-of-pocket expenses include fees of outside counsel and experts. We do not accrue
	for costs that are part of our corporate overhead, such as the costs of our in-house legal and risk management departments. The losses resulting from professional liability claims primarily consist of estimates for known claims, as well as estimates
	for incurred but not reported claims. The estimates are based on specific claim facts, our historical claim reporting and payment patterns, the nature and level of our hospital operations, and actuarially determined projections. The actuarially
	determined projections are based on our actual claim data, including historic reporting and payment patterns which have been gathered over approximately a 20-year period. As discussed below, since we purchase excess insurance on a claims-made basis
	that transfers risk to third-party insurers, the liability we accrue does include an amount for the losses covered by our excess insurance. We also record a receivable for the expected reimbursement of losses covered by our excess insurance. Since
	we believe that the amount and timing of our future claims payments are reliably determinable, we discount the amount we accrue for losses resulting from professional liability claims using the risk-free interest rate corresponding to the timing of
	our expected payments.

	The net present value of the projected payments was discounted using a weighted-average risk-free rate of 1.6%,
	1.7% and 1.6% in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. This liability is adjusted for new claims information in the period such information becomes known to us. Professional malpractice expense includes the losses resulting from professional liability
	claims and loss adjustment expense, as well as paid excess insurance premiums, and is presented within other operating expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of income.

	Our processes for obtaining and analyzing claims and incident data are standardized across all of our hospitals and have been consistent for
	many years. We monitor the outcomes of the medical care services that we provide and for each reported claim, we obtain various information concerning the facts and circumstances related to that claim. In addition, we routinely monitor current key
	statistics and volume indicators in our assessment of utilizing historical trends. The average lag period between claim occurrence and payment of a final settlement is between four and five years, although the facts and circumstances of individual
	claims could result in the timing of such payments being different from this average. Since claims are paid promptly after settlement with the claimant is reached, settled claims represent less than 1.0% of the total liability at the end of any
	period.

	For purposes of estimating our individual claim accruals, we utilize specific claim information, including the nature of the
	claim, the expected claim amount, the year in which the claim occurred and the laws of the jurisdiction in which the claim occurred. Once the case accruals for known claims are determined, information is stratified by loss layers and retentions,
	accident years, reported years, geography, and claims relating to the acquired HMA hospitals versus claims relating to our other hospitals. Several actuarial methods are used against this data to produce estimates of ultimate paid losses and
	reserves for incurred but not reported claims. Each of these methods uses our company-specific historical claims data and other information. This company-specific data includes information regarding our business, including historical paid losses and
	loss adjustment expenses, historical and current case loss reserves, actual and projected hospital statistical data, a variety of hospital census information, employed physician information, professional liability retentions for each policy year,

	Based on these analyses, we determine our estimate of the professional liability claims. The
	determination of management&#146;s estimate, including the preparation of the reserve analysis that supports such estimate, involves subjective judgment of management. Changes in reserving data or the trends and factors that influence reserving data
	may signal fundamental shifts in our future claim development patterns or may simply reflect single-period anomalies. Even if a change reflects a fundamental shift, the full extent of the change may not become evident until years later. Moreover,

	In April 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, issued ASU 2014-08, which changes the requirements for reporting
	discontinued operations. A discontinued operation continues to include a component of an entity or a group of components of an entity, or a business activity. However, in a shift reflecting stakeholder concerns that too many disposals of small
	groups of assets that are recurring in nature qualified for reporting as discontinued operations, a disposal of a component of an entity or a group of components of an entity will be required to be reported in discontinued operations if the disposal
	represents a strategic shift that has (or will have) a major effect on an entity&#146;s operations and financial results. A business or nonprofit activity that, on acquisition, meets the criteria to be classified as held for sale will still be a
	discontinued operation. Additional disclosures will be required for significant components of the entity that are disposed of or are held for sale but do not qualify as discontinued operations. This ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after
	December&nbsp;15, 2014 and is to be applied on a prospective basis for disposals or components initially classified as held for sale after that date. We adopted this ASU on January&nbsp;1, 2015 and the adoption resulted in divestitures occurring
	subsequent to the date of adoption being included in continuing operations for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2015.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:2%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	In May 2014, the
	FASB issued ASU 2014-09, which outlines a single comprehensive model for recognizing revenue and supersedes most existing revenue recognition guidance, including guidance specific to the healthcare industry. This ASU provides companies the option of
	applying a full or modified retrospective approach upon adoption. This ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December&nbsp;15, 2016. However, the FASB recently issued a final ASU that defers the effective date by one year, with early
	adoption permitted for annual periods beginning after December&nbsp;15, 2016. We expect to adopt this ASU on January&nbsp;1, 2018 and are currently evaluating our plan for adoption and the impact on our revenue recognition policies, procedures and
	control framework and the resulting impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows.

	In April 2015,
	the FASB issued ASU 2015-03, which requires debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct reduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability, consistent with the accounting for debt
	discounts. The ASU did not change the measurement or recognition guidance for debt issuance costs. This ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December&nbsp;31, 2015, with early adoption permitted. We adopted this ASU on January&nbsp;1,
	2016, which will result in the reclassification of approximately $266 million of debt issuance costs from other long-term assets to a reduction of the related long-term debt.

	ASU requires that deferred tax liabilities and assets be classified as noncurrent in a classified statement of financial position. This ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after
	December&nbsp;31, 2016, with early adoption permitted. We early adopted the provisions of this ASU for the presentation and classification of its deferred tax assets at December&nbsp;31, 2015. The effect of this change primarily resulted in the
	current portion of deferred income taxes at December&nbsp;31, 2015 being included in the noncurrent deferred income tax liability. We did not retrospectively apply the provisions of this ASU to prior periods as permitted by the standard.

	to manage the volatility relating to the market risk, we entered into interest rate swap agreements described under the heading &#147;Liquidity and Capital Resources&#148; in Part II, Item&nbsp;7. We utilize risk management procedures and controls
	in executing derivative financial instrument transactions. We do not execute transactions or hold derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. Derivative financial instruments related to interest rate sensitivity of debt obligations are
	used with the goal of mitigating a portion of the exposure when it is cost effective to do so. As of December&nbsp;31, 2015, our approximately $3.0 billion notional amount of interest rate swap agreements outstanding represented approximately 37.9%
	of our variable rate debt.

	A 1% change in interest rates on variable rate debt in excess of that amount covered by interest rate swaps
	would have resulted in interest expense fluctuating approximately $61 million in 2015, $59 million in 2014 and $20 million in 2013. On a prospective basis, a 1% change in interest rates on the remaining unhedged variable rate debt existing as of
	December&nbsp;31, 2015, would result in interest expense fluctuating approximately $53 million per year.

	As discussed in Note 1 to the financial statements, as

	Third-Party Reimbursement.
</I>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Net patient service revenue is reported at the estimated net realizable amount from
	patients, third-party payors and others for services rendered. Operating revenues include amounts estimated by management to be reimbursable by Medicare and Medicaid under prospective payment systems, provisions of cost-reimbursement and other
	payment methods. Approximately 35.3%, 35.5% and 34.5% of operating revenues, net of contractual allowances and discounts (but before the provision for bad debts), for the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively, are related
	to services rendered to patients covered by the Medicare and Medicaid programs. Revenues from Medicare outlier payments are included in the amounts received from Medicare and were approximately 0.28%, 0.41% and 0.46% of operating revenues, net of
	contractual allowances and discounts (but before the provision for bad debts), for the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. In addition, the Company is reimbursed by non-governmental payors using a variety of payment
	methodologies. Amounts received by the Company for treatment of patients covered by such programs are generally less than the standard billing rates. The differences between the estimated program reimbursement rates and the standard billing rates
	are accounted for as contractual adjustments, which are deducted from gross revenues to arrive at operating revenues (net of contractual allowances and discounts). These net operating revenues are an estimate of the net realizable amount due from
	these payors. The process of estimating contractual allowances requires the Company to estimate the amount expected to be received based on payor contract provisions. The key assumption in this process is the estimated contractual reimbursement
	percentage, which is based on payor classification and historical paid claims data. Due to the complexities involved in these estimates, actual payments the Company receives could be different from the amounts it estimates and records. Final
	settlements under some of these programs are subject to adjustment based on administrative review and audit by third parties. Adjustments to previous program reimbursement estimates are accounted for as contractual allowance adjustments and reported
	in the periods that such adjustments become known.

	Amounts due to third-party payors were $112 million and $147 million as of
	December&nbsp;31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, and are included in accrued liabilities-other in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Amounts due from third-party payors were $213 million and $183 million as of December&nbsp;31, 2015 and
	2014, respectively, and are included in other current assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Substantially all Medicare and Medicaid cost reports are final settled through 2011.

	Net Operating Revenues.

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Net operating revenues are recorded net of provisions for contractual allowance of
	approximately $95.3 billion, $84.4 billion and $52.6 billion for the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Net operating revenues are recognized when services are provided and are reported at the estimated net realizable
	amount from patients, third-party payors and others for services rendered. Also included in the provision for contractual allowance shown above is the value of administrative and other discounts provided to self-pay patients eliminated from net
	operating revenues which was $3.0 billion, $2.8 billion and $1.3 billion for the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.

	In the ordinary course of business, the Company renders services to patients who are financially unable to pay for hospital care. The
	Company&#146;s policy is to not pursue collections for such amounts; therefore, the related charges for those patients who are financially unable to pay and that otherwise do not qualify for reimbursement from a governmental program are not reported
	in net operating revenues or in the provision for bad debts, and are thus classified as charity care. The Company determines amounts that qualify for charity care primarily based on the patient&#146;s household income relative to the federal poverty
	level guidelines, as established by the federal government.

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The federal government has implemented a number of

	final incentive payment.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:2%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Medicaid EHR incentive payments are calculated based on prior period Medicare cost report information available

	income from resolving the gain contingency is recognized when eligible hospitals adopt, implement, upgrade or demonstrate meaningful use of certified EHR technology.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:2%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Medicare EHR incentive payments are calculated based on the Medicare cost report information for the full cost report year that began during

	the gain contingency is recognized when eligible hospitals demonstrate meaningful use of certified EHR technology and the information for the applicable full Medicare cost report year to determine the final incentive payment is available.

	In some instances, the Company may receive estimated Medicare EHR incentive payments prior to when the Medicare cost report information used

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:2%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Eligibility for annual Medicare incentive payments is dependent on providers successfully attesting to the meaningful use of EHR technology.
	Medicaid incentive payments are available to providers in the first payment year that they adopt, implement or upgrade certified EHR technology; however, providers must demonstrate meaningful use of such technology in any subsequent payment years to
	qualify for additional incentive payments. Medicaid EHR incentive payments are fully funded by the federal government and administered by the states; however, the states are not required to offer EHR incentive payments to providers.

	available that is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance. Aggregation of similar operating segments into a single reportable operating segment is permitted if the

	operating segments, represented by the hospital operations (which includes the Company&#146;s acute care hospitals and related healthcare entities that provide inpatient and outpatient healthcare services) and the home care agencies operations
	(which provide in-home outpatient care). U.S. GAAP requires (1)&nbsp;that financial information be disclosed for operating segments that meet a 10% quantitative threshold of the consolidated totals of net revenue, profit or loss, or total assets;
	and (2)&nbsp;that the individual reportable segments disclosed contribute at least 75% of total consolidated net revenue. Based on these measures, only the hospital operations segment meets the criteria as a separate reportable segment. Financial
	information for the home care agencies segment does not meet the quantitative thresholds and is therefore combined with corporate into the all other reportable segment.

	In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (&#147;FASB&#148;) issued
	Accounting Standards Update (&#147;ASU&#148;) 2014-09, which outlines a single comprehensive model for recognizing revenue and supersedes most existing revenue recognition guidance, including guidance specific to the healthcare industry. This ASU
	provides companies the option of applying a full or modified retrospective approach upon adoption. This ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December&nbsp;15, 2016. However, the FASB recently issued a final ASU that defers the effective
	date by one year, with early adoption permitted for annual periods beginning after December&nbsp;15, 2016. The Company expects to adopt this ASU on January&nbsp;1, 2018 and is currently evaluating its plan for adoption and the impact on its revenue
	recognition policies, procedures and control framework and the resulting impact on its consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows.

	In November 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-17, which amended the balance sheet classification requirements for deferred income taxes to

	beginning after December&nbsp;31, 2016, with early adoption permitted. The Company early adopted the provisions of this ASU for the presentation and classification of its deferred tax assets at December&nbsp;31, 2015. The effect of this change
	primarily resulted in the current portion of deferred income taxes at December&nbsp;31, 2015 being included in the noncurrent deferred income tax liability. The Company did not retrospectively apply the provisions of this ASU to prior periods as

	The Company has also awarded restricted stock under the 2000 Plan and the 2009 Plan to its directors and
	employees of certain subsidiaries. The restrictions on these shares generally lapse in one-third increments on each of the first three anniversaries of the award date. Certain of the restricted stock awards granted to the Company&#146;s senior
	executives contain a performance objective that must be met in addition to any time-based vesting requirements. If the performance objective is not attained, the awards will be forfeited in their entirety. Once the performance objective has been
	attained, restrictions will lapse in one-third increments on each of the first three anniversaries of the award date. In addition, 835,000 restricted stock awards granted March&nbsp;1, 2014 have a performance objective that is measured based on the
	realization of synergies related to the HMA merger over a two-year period that began on February&nbsp;1, 2014. The performance objective could be met in part in the first year or in whole or in part over such two-year period. Depending on the degree
	of attainment of the performance objective, restrictions may lapse on a portion of the award grant over the first three anniversaries of the award date at a level dependent upon the amount of synergies realized. If the synergies related to the HMA
	merger did not reach a certain level, then the awards would have been forfeited in their entirety. Based on the synergy levels attained in the first annual measurement period ended on January&nbsp;31, 2015, the performance objective for the first
	measurement period was met, and one-third of the awards vested on March&nbsp;1, 2015. Based on the synergy levels attained in the second annual measurement period ended on January&nbsp;31, 2016, the performance objective for the second measurement
	period was met, and one-third of the awards are expected to vest on March&nbsp;1, 2016. Notwithstanding the above-mentioned performance objectives and vesting requirements, the restrictions with respect to restricted stock granted under the 2000
	Plan and the 2009 Plan will lapse earlier in the event of death, disability or termination of employment by the Company for any reason other than for cause of the holder of the restricted stock, or change in control of the Company. Restricted stock
	awards subject to performance standards that have not yet been satisfied are not considered outstanding for purposes of determining earnings per share until the performance objectives have been satisfied.

	The Company accounts for all transactions that represent business combinations using the acquisition method of accounting, where the
	identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interest in the acquired entity are recognized and measured at their fair values on the date the Company obtains control in the acquiree. Such fair values that are not
	finalized for reporting periods following the acquisition date are estimated and recorded as provisional amounts. Adjustments to these provisional amounts during the measurement period (defined as the date through which all information required to
	identify and measure the consideration transferred, the assets acquired, the liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interests has been obtained, limited to one year from the acquisition date) are recorded as of the date of acquisition. Any
	material impact to comparative information for periods after acquisition, but before the period in which adjustments are identified, is reflected in those prior periods as if the adjustments were considered as of the acquisition date. Goodwill is
	determined as the excess of the fair value of the consideration conveyed in the acquisition over the fair value of the net assets acquired.

	Pro forma adjustments to net income include adjustments to depreciation and amortization expense, net of the

	January&nbsp;1, 2013. The pro forma amounts for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2014 were adjusted to exclude approximately $69 million of certain nonrecurring acquisition and related integration costs incurred by the Company related to HMA. Pro
	forma amounts for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2013 were adjusted to include these costs. The pro forma net income for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2014 includes a charge for the early extinguishment of debt of $73 million before taxes and
	$45 million after taxes, or $0.40 per share (diluted). The pro forma net loss for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2013 includes approximately $133 million before taxes and approximately $83 million after taxes, or $0.74 per share (diluted), in
	change in control and other related expenses recorded by HMA for amounts triggered by the change in control of the HMA board of directors during the three months ended September&nbsp;30, 2013.

	On
	January&nbsp;27, 2014, the Company completed the HMA merger by acquiring all the outstanding shares of HMA&#146;s common stock for approximately $7.3 billion, including the assumption of approximately $3.8 billion of existing indebtedness, for
	consideration for each share of HMA&#146;s common stock consisting of $10.50 in cash, 0.06942 of a share of the Company&#146;s common stock, and one contingent value right (&#147;CVR&#148;). The CVR entitles the holder to receive a cash payment of
	up to $1.00 per CVR (subject to downward adjustment but not below zero), subject to the final resolution of certain legal matters pertaining to HMA, as defined in the CVR agreement. At the time of the completion of the HMA merger, HMA owned and
	operated 71 hospitals in 15&nbsp;states in non-urban communities located primarily in the southeastern United States.

</B>
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:2%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	On August&nbsp;3, 2015, the Company announced a plan to spin off 38 hospitals and Quorum Health Resources into Quorum
	Health Corporation (&#147;QHC&#148;), an independent, publicly-traded corporation. The transaction, which would be effected through the distribution of QHC common stock to the Company&#146;s shareholders, is intended to be tax free to the Company
	and its shareholders, and is expected to close in the first half of 2016. The completion of the spin-off is subject to, among other requirements, the effectiveness of QHC&#146;s registration statement on Form 10, requisite regulatory approvals,
	execution of operational transition agreements, the receipt of opinions of tax, legal and valuation advisors (including as to the tax-free nature of the transaction), market conditions and final Board approval. QHC filed an Amendment No.&nbsp;3 to
	Form 10 on December&nbsp;4, 2015 (the Form 10 has not yet become effective), which filing contains information regarding the contemplated spin-off and the anticipated business of QHC. The Form 10 is available on the SEC&#146;s website but is not
	incorporated by reference into this Annual Report on Form 10-K. There can be no assurance regarding the ultimate timing of the spin-off, or that it will be completed. The results of operations for QHC have continued to be presented in continuing
	operations in the consolidated statement of income as the Company has determined that the planned spin-off of QHC does not meet the criteria as discontinued operations under ASU 2014-08.

	Goodwill is allocated to each identified reporting unit, which is defined as an operating segment or one level
	below the operating segment (referred to as a component of the entity). Management has determined that the Company&#146;s operating segments and hospital management services operations meet the criteria to be classified as reporting units. At
	December&nbsp;31, 2015, the hospital operations reporting unit, the home care agency operations reporting unit and the hospital management services reporting unit had approximately $8.9&nbsp;billion, $47&nbsp;million and $33 million, respectively,
	of goodwill.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:2%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Goodwill is evaluated for impairment at the same time every year and when an event occurs or circumstances change that, more
	likely than not, reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying value. There is a two-step method for determining goodwill impairment. Step one is to compare the fair value of the reporting unit with the unit&#146;s carrying amount,
	including goodwill. If this test indicates the fair value is less than the carrying value, then step two is required to compare the implied fair value of the reporting unit&#146;s goodwill with the carrying value of the reporting unit&#146;s
	goodwill. The Company performed its last annual goodwill evaluation during the fourth quarter of 2015. No impairment was indicated by this evaluation. The next annual goodwill evaluation will be performed during the fourth quarter of 2016.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:2%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The Company estimates the fair value of the related reporting units using both a discounted cash flow model as well as an EBITDA multiple
	model. The cash flow forecasts are adjusted by an appropriate discount rate based on the Company&#146;s estimate of a market participant&#146;s weighted-average cost of capital. These models are both based on the Company&#146;s best estimate of
	future revenues and operating costs and are reconciled to the Company&#146;s consolidated market capitalization, with consideration of the amount a potential acquirer would be required to pay, in the form of a control premium, in order to gain
	sufficient ownership to set policies, direct operations and control management decisions.

	The weighted-average remaining amortization period for the intangible assets subject to amortization is approximately four years. There are no
	expected residual values related to these intangible assets. Amortization expense on these intangible assets was $15 million, $13 million and $6 million during the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Amortization expense
	on intangible assets is estimated to be $15 million in 2016, $5 million in 2017, $4 million in 2018, $2&nbsp;million in 2019, $2 million in 2020 and $3&nbsp;million thereafter.

	The gross carrying amount of capitalized software for internal use was approximately $1.5 billion at each of December&nbsp;31, 2015 and 2014,
	and the net carrying amount considering accumulated amortization was approximately $771 million and $790 million at December&nbsp;31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The estimated amortization period for capitalized internal-use software is generally
	three years, except for capitalized costs related to significant system conversions, which is generally eight to ten years. There is no expected residual value for capitalized internal-use software. At December&nbsp;31, 2015, there was approximately
	$39 million of capitalized costs for internal-use software that is currently in the development stage and will begin amortization once the software project is complete and ready for its intended use. Amortization expense on capitalized internal-use
	software was $212 million, $260 million and $139 million during the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Amortization expense on capitalized internal-use software is estimated to be $219 million in 2016, $179 million in

	In connection with the HMA merger,
	the Company further analyzed its intangible assets related to internal-use software used in certain of its hospitals for patient and clinical systems, including software required to meet criteria for meaningful use attestation and ICD-10 compliance.
	This analysis resulted in management reassessing its usage of certain software products and rationalizing that, with the addition of the HMA hospitals in the first quarter of 2014, those software applications were going to be discontinued and
	replaced with new applications that better integrate meaningful use and ICD-10 compliance, are more cost effective and can be implemented at a greater efficiency of scale over future implementations. During the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2014, the
	Company recorded an impairment charge of approximately $24 million related to software in-process that was abandoned and the acceleration of amortization of approximately $75 million related to shortening the remaining useful life of software
	abandoned.

	The Company&#146;s effective tax rates were 28.4%, 23.8% and 30.0% for the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2015,
	2014 and 2013, respectively. The increase in the Company&#146;s effective tax rate for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2015 is primarily impacted by the increase in income from continuing operations before income taxes after adjusting for the
	decrease in net income attributable to noncontrolling interests, which is not tax effected in the statement of income. Including the expense related to income attributable to noncontrolling interests, the effective tax rate for the years ended
	December&nbsp;31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 would have been 37.6%, 35.5% and 38.5%, respectively.

	The Company believes that the net deferred tax assets will ultimately be realized, except as noted below. Its
	conclusion is based on its estimate of future taxable income and the expected timing of temporary difference reversals. The Company has state net operating loss carry forwards of approximately $5.7 billion, which expire from 2016 to 2035. The
	Company also has unrecognized deferred tax assets primarily related to interest expense that are included in other comprehensive income. If recognized, additional state net operating losses will be created which the Company does not expect to be
	able to utilize prior to the expiration of the carryforward period. A valuation allowance of approximately $6 million has been recognized for those items. With respect to the deferred tax liability pertaining to intangibles, as included above,
	goodwill purchased in connection with certain of the Company&#146;s business acquisitions is amortizable for income tax reporting purposes. However, for financial reporting purposes, there is no corresponding amortization allowed with respect to
	such purchased goodwill.

	The valuation allowance increased by $56 million during the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2015 and increased by
	$109 million during the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2014. In addition to amounts previously discussed, the change in valuation allowance relates to a redetermination of the amount of, and realizability of, net operating losses and credits in
	certain income tax jurisdictions.

	The Company&#146;s wholly-owned subsidiary, CHS, has senior secured financing under a credit facility with a syndicate of financial
	institutions led by Credit Suisse, as administrative agent and collateral agent.&nbsp;In connection with the HMA merger, the Company and CHS entered into a third amendment and restatement of its credit facility (the &#147;Credit Facility&#148;),
	providing for additional financing and recapitalization of certain of the Company&#146;s term loans, including (i)&nbsp;the replacement of the revolving credit facility with a new $1.0 billion revolving facility maturing in 2019 (the &#147;Revolving
	Facility&#148;), (ii)&nbsp;the addition of a new $1.0 billion Term A facility due 2019 (the &#147;Term A Facility&#148;), (iii)&nbsp;a Term D facility in an aggregate principal amount equal to approximately $4.6 billion due 2021 (which included
	certain term C loans that were converted into such Term D facility (collectively, the &#147;Term D Facility&#148;)), (iv)&nbsp;the conversion of certain term C loans into Term E Loans and the borrowing of new Term E Loans in an aggregate principal
	amount of approximately $1.7 billion due 2017 and (v)&nbsp;the addition of flexibility commensurate with the Company&#146;s post-acquisition structure. In addition to funding a portion of the consideration in connection with the HMA merger, some of
	the proceeds of the Term A Facility and Term D Facility were used to refinance the outstanding $637 million existing term A facility due 2016 and the $60 million of term B loans due 2014, respectively. The Revolving Facility includes a subfacility
	for letters of credit. On March&nbsp;9, 2015, CHS entered into Amendment No.&nbsp;1 and Incremental Term Loan Assumption Agreement to refinance the existing Term E Loans due 2017 into Term F Loans due 2018, in an original aggregated principal amount
	of $1.7 billion. On May&nbsp;18, 2015, CHS entered into an Incremental Term Loan Assumption Agreement to provide for a new $1.6 billion incremental Term G facility and a new approximately $2.9 billion incremental Term H facility. The proceeds of the
	Term G facility and Term H facility were used to repay the Company&#146;s existing Term D facility in full.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:2%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	On
	March&nbsp;21, 2012, through certain of its subsidiaries, CHS entered into an accounts receivable loan agreement (the &#147;Receivables Facility&#148;) with a group of lenders and banks, Credit Agricol&eacute; Corporate and Investment Bank, as a
	managing agent and as the administrative agent, and The Bank of Nova Scotia, as a managing agent. On March&nbsp;7, 2013, CHS and certain of its subsidiaries amended the Receivables Facility to add an additional managing agent, The Bank of
	Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ, Ltd., to increase the size of the facility from $300 million to $500 million and to extend the scheduled termination date. Additional subsidiaries also agreed to participate in the Receivables Facility as of that date. On
	March&nbsp;31, 2014, CHS and certain of its subsidiaries amended the Receivables Facility to increase the size of the facility from $500 million to $700 million and to extend the scheduled termination date. Additional subsidiaries also agreed to
	participate in the Receivables Facility as of that date. On November&nbsp;13, 2015, CHS and certain of its subsidiaries amended the Receivables Facility to extend the scheduled termination date and amend certain other provisions thereof. The
	existing and future non-self pay patient-related accounts receivable (the &#147;Receivables&#148;) for certain affiliated hospitals serve as collateral for the outstanding borrowings under the Receivables Facility. The interest rate on the
	borrowings is based on the commercial paper rate plus an applicable interest rate spread. Unless earlier terminated or subsequently extended pursuant to its terms, the Receivables Facility will expire on November&nbsp;13, 2017, subject to customary
	termination events that could cause an early termination date. CHS maintains effective control over the Receivables because, pursuant to the terms of the Receivables Facility, the Receivables are sold from certain of CHS&#146; subsidiaries to CHS,
	and CHS then sells or contributes the Receivables to a special-purpose entity that is wholly-owned by CHS. The wholly-owned special-purpose entity in turn grants security interests in the Receivables in exchange for borrowings obtained from the
	group of third-party lenders and banks of up to $700&nbsp;million outstanding from time to time based on the availability of eligible Receivables and other customary factors. The group of third-party lenders and banks do not have recourse to CHS or
	its subsidiaries beyond the assets of the wholly-owned special-purpose entity that collateralizes the loan. The Receivables and other assets of the wholly-owned special-purpose entity will be available first and foremost to satisfy the claims of the
	creditors of such entity. The outstanding borrowings pursuant to the Receivables Facility at December&nbsp;31, 2015 totaled $700 million and are classified as long-term debt on the consolidated balance sheet. At December&nbsp;31, 2015, the carrying
	amount of Receivables included in the Receivables Facility totaled approximately $1.7 billion and is included in patient accounts receivable on the consolidated balance sheet.

	The Company has transitioned all of its hospitals to the ICD-10 coding system, which was required of all healthcare providers covered by the
	Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (&#147;HIPAA&#148;). This transition involved a significant capital investment in technology and coding of our information systems, as well as significant costs related to training of staff
	involved with coding and billing. As noted in the Company&#146;s risk factors set forth in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the potential for delay in billing and collection on patient receivables resulting from these changes or from new payment
	systems and processes implemented by third-party payors could have an adverse effect on the quality of receivables that serve as collateral under the Receivables Facility, resulting in a potential default or repayment of outstanding borrowings.
	Should such a repayment of borrowings under the Receivables Facility be required, the Company has availability, and expects that it will continue to have availability, under its Revolving Facility to provide sufficient financial resources and
	liquidity to fund the repayment.

	To limit the effect of changes in interest rates on a portion of the Company&#146;s long-term borrowings, the Company is a party to 13
	separate interest swap agreements in effect at December&nbsp;31, 2015, with an aggregate notional amount for currently effective swaps of $3.0 billion, and two forward-starting swap agreements with an aggregate notional amount of $500 million. On
	each of these swaps, the Company receives a variable rate of interest based on the three-month LIBOR in exchange for the payment of a fixed rate of interest. The Company currently pays, on a quarterly basis, interest on the Revolving Facility and
	the Term A Facility at a rate per annum equal to LIBOR plus 2.75%. Loans in respect of the Term F Facility accrue interest at a rate per annum equal to LIBOR plus 3.25%. The Term G Loan and Term H Loan accrue interest at a rate per annum equal to
	LIBOR plus 2.75% and 3.00%, in the case of LIBOR borrowings, respectively, and Alternate Base Rate plus 1.75% and 2.00%, respectively, in the case of Alternate Base Rate Borrowings. The Term G Loan and the Term H Loan are subject to a 1.00% LIBOR
	floor and a 2.00% Alternate Base Rate floor. See Note 8 for additional information regarding these swaps.

	The fair value of
	interest rate swap agreements is the amount at which they could be settled, based on estimates calculated by the Company using a discounted cash flow analysis based on observable market inputs and validated by comparison to estimates obtained from
	the counterparty. The Company incorporates credit valuation adjustments (&#147;CVAs&#148;) to appropriately reflect both its own nonperformance or credit risk and the respective counterparty&#146;s nonperformance or credit risk in the fair value
	measurements. In adjusting the fair value of its interest rate swap agreements for the effect of nonperformance or credit risk, the Company has considered the impact of any netting features included in the agreements.

	The Company assesses the effectiveness of its hedge instruments on a quarterly basis. For the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2015 and 2014, the
	Company completed an assessment of the cash flow hedge instruments and determined the hedges to be highly effective. The Company has also determined that the ineffective portion of the hedges do not have a material effect on the Company&#146;s
	consolidated financial position, operations or cash flows. The counterparties to the interest rate swap agreements expose the Company to credit risk in the event of nonperformance. However, at December&nbsp;31, 2015, all of the swap agreements
	entered into by the Company were in a net liability position such that the Company would be required to make the net settlement payments to the counterparties; the Company does not anticipate nonperformance by those counterparties. The Company does
	not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes.

	The Company is exposed to certain risks relating to its ongoing business operations. The risk managed by using derivative instruments is
	interest rate risk. Interest rate swaps are entered into to manage interest rate fluctuation risk associated with the term loans in the Credit Facility. Companies are required to recognize all derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities
	at fair value in the consolidated statement of financial position. The Company designates its interest rate swaps as cash flow hedges. For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges, the effective portion of the gain
	or loss on the derivative is reported as a component of other comprehensive income (&#147;OCI&#148;) and reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods during which the hedged transactions affect earnings. Gains and losses on the
	derivative representing either hedge ineffectiveness or hedge components excluded from the assessment of effectiveness are recognized in current earnings.

	Fair value is a market-based measurement, not an entity-specific measurement. Therefore, a fair value measurement should be determined based
	on the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. As a basis for considering market participant assumptions in fair value measurements, the Company utilizes the U.S. GAAP fair value hierarchy that distinguishes
	between market participant assumptions based on market data obtained from sources independent of the reporting entity (observable inputs that are classified within Levels&nbsp;1 and 2 of the hierarchy) and the reporting entity&#146;s own assumption
	about market participant assumptions (unobservable inputs classified within Level&nbsp;3 of the hierarchy).

	In instances where the
	determination of the fair value hierarchy measurement is based on inputs from different levels of the fair value hierarchy, the level in the fair value hierarchy within which the entire fair value measurement falls is based on the lowest level input
	that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. The Company&#146;s assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment of factors specific to the asset or liability.
	Transfers between levels within the fair value hierarchy are recognized by the Company on the date of the change in circumstances that requires such transfer. There were no transfers between levels during 2015 or 2014.

	As of December&nbsp;31, 2015 and 2014, investments with aggregate estimated fair values of approximately
	$119&nbsp;million (329 investments) and $96 million (300 investments), respectively, generated the gross unrealized losses disclosed in the above table. At each reporting date, the Company performs an evaluation of impaired securities to determine
	if the unrealized losses are other-than-temporary. This evaluation considers a number of factors including, but not limited to, the length of time and extent to which the fair value has been less than cost, and management&#146;s ability and intent
	to hold the securities until fair value recovers. Based on the results of this evaluation, management concluded that as of December&nbsp;31, 2015, there are approximately $5 million of other-than-temporary losses related to available-for-sale
	securities. The recent declines in value of the remaining securities and/or length of time they have been below cost, as well as the Company&#146;s ability and intent to hold the securities for a reasonable period of time sufficient for a projected
	recovery of fair value, have caused management to conclude that the remaining securities, that have generated gross unrealized losses, were not other-than-temporarily impaired. Management will continue to monitor and evaluate the recoverability of
	the Company&#146;s available-for-sale securities.

	The CVR represents the estimate of the fair value for the contingent consideration paid to HMA shareholders as part of the HMA merger. The CVR
	is listed on the NASDAQ and the valuation at December&nbsp;31, 2015 is based on the quoted trading price for the CVR on the last day of the period. Changes in the estimated fair value of the CVR are recorded through the consolidated statement of

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:2%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The
	CVR-related legal liability represents the Company&#146;s estimate of fair value at December&nbsp;31, 2015 of the liability associated with the legal matters assumed in the HMA merger, which are included in accrued liabilities in the accompanying
	consolidated balance sheet. This liability did not include those matters previously accrued by HMA as a probable contingency, which have been settled and paid during the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2015. To develop the estimate of fair value, the
	Company engaged an independent third-party valuation firm to measure the liability. The valuation was made utilizing the Company&#146;s estimates of future outcomes for each legal case and simulating future outcomes based on the timing, probability
	and distribution of several scenarios using a Monte Carlo simulation model. Other inputs were then utilized for discounting the liability to the measurement date. The HMA legal matters underlying this fair value estimate were evaluated by management
	to determine the likelihood and impact of each of the potential outcomes. Using that information, as well as the potential correlation and variability associated with each case, a fair value was determined for the estimated future cash outflows to
	conclude or settle the HMA legal matters included in the analysis, excluding legal fees (which are expensed as incurred). Because of the unobservable nature of the majority of the inputs used to value the liability, the Company has classified the
	fair value measurement as a Level 3 measurement in the fair value hierarchy.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:2%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The valuation of the Company&#146;s interest rate swap agreements is determined using market valuation techniques, including discounted cash
	flow analysis on the expected cash flows of each agreement. This analysis reflects the contractual terms of the agreement, including the period to maturity, and uses observable market-based inputs, including forward interest rate curves. The fair
	value of interest rate swap agreements are determined by netting the discounted future fixed cash payments and the discounted expected variable cash receipts. The variable cash receipts are based on the expectation of future interest rates based on
	observable market forward interest rate curves and the notional amount being hedged.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:2%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The Company incorporates CVAs to appropriately
	reflect both its own nonperformance or credit risk and the respective counterparty&#146;s nonperformance or credit risk in the fair value measurements. In adjusting the fair value of its interest rate swap agreements for the effect of nonperformance
	or credit risk, the Company has considered the impact of any netting features included in the agreements. The CVA on the Company&#146;s interest rate swap agreements resulted in a decrease in the fair value of the related liability of $4 million and
	an after-tax adjustment of $2 million to OCI at both December&nbsp;31, 2015 and 2014.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:2%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The majority of the inputs used to value the
	Company&#146;s interest rate swap agreements, including the forward interest rate curves and market perceptions of the Company&#146;s credit risk used in the CVAs, are observable inputs available to a market participant. As a result, the Company has
	determined that the interest rate swap valuations are classified in Level&nbsp;2 of the fair value hierarchy.

	2014, the Company repurchased and retired 175,000&nbsp;shares at a weighted-average price of $49.72 per share. During the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2013, the Company repurchased and retired 706,023 shares at a weighted-average price of $38.39 per
	share. The cumulative number of shares repurchased and retired under this program was 881,023 shares at a weighted-average price of $40.64 per share.

	The Company is a holding company which operates through its subsidiaries. The Company&#146;s Credit Facility and the indentures governing the
	senior and senior secured notes contain various covenants under which the assets of the subsidiaries of the Company are subject to certain restrictions relating to, among other matters, dividends and distributions, as referenced in the paragraph
	below.

	With the exception of a special cash dividend of $0.25 per share paid by the Company in December 2012, historically, the Company
	has not paid any cash dividends. Subject to certain exceptions, the Company&#146;s Credit Facility limits the ability of the Company&#146;s subsidiaries to pay dividends and make distributions to the Company, and limits the Company&#146;s ability to
	pay dividends and/or repurchase stock, to an amount not to exceed $200&nbsp;million in the aggregate plus an additional $25 million in any particular year plus the aggregate amount of proceeds from the exercise of stock options. The indentures
	governing the senior and senior secured notes also restrict the Company&#146;s subsidiaries from, among other matters, paying dividends and making distributions to the Company, which thereby limits the Company&#146;s ability to pay dividends and/or
	repurchase stock. As of December&nbsp;31, 2015, under the most restrictive test under these agreements (and subject to certain exceptions), the Company has approximately $318 million remaining available with which to pay permitted dividends and/or
	repurchase shares of stock or its senior and senior secured notes.

	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As part of its physician recruitment strategy, the Company provides income
	guarantee agreements to certain physicians who agree to relocate to its communities and commit to remain in practice there. Under such agreements, the Company is required to make payments to the physicians in excess of the amounts they earned in
	their practice up to the amount of the income guarantee. These income guarantee periods are typically for 12 months. Such payments are recoverable by the Company from physicians who do not fulfill their commitment period, which is typically three
	years, to the respective community. At December&nbsp;31, 2015, the maximum potential amount of future payments under these guarantees in excess of the liability recorded is $34 million.

	out-of-pocket expenses include fees of outside counsel and experts. The Company does not accrue for costs that are part of corporate overhead, such as the costs of in-house legal and risk management departments. The losses resulting from
	professional liability claims primarily consist of estimates for known claims, as well as estimates for incurred but not reported claims. The estimates are based on specific claim facts, historical claim reporting and payment patterns, the nature
	and level of hospital operations and actuarially determined projections. The actuarially determined projections are based on the Company&#146;s actual claim data, including historic reporting and payment patterns which have been gathered over an
	approximate 20-year period. As discussed below, since the Company purchases excess insurance on a claims-made basis that transfers risk to third-party insurers, the liability it accrues does include an amount for the losses covered by its excess
	insurance. The Company also records a receivable for the expected reimbursement of losses covered by excess insurance. Since the Company believes that the amount and timing of its future claims payments are reliably determinable, it discounts the
	amount accrued for losses resulting from professional liability claims using the risk-free interest rate corresponding to the timing of expected payments.

	The net present value of the projected payments was discounted using a weighted-average risk-free rate of 1.6%, 1.7% and 1.6% in 2015, 2014
	and 2013, respectively. This liability is adjusted for new claims information in the period such information becomes known. The Company&#146;s estimated liability for professional and general liability claims was $901 million and $924 million as of
	December&nbsp;31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The estimated undiscounted claims liability was $949 million and $964 million as of December&nbsp;31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The current portion of the liability for professional and general
	liability claims was $156 million and $164 million as of December&nbsp;31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, and is included in other accrued liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets, with the long-term portion recorded in other
	long-term liabilities. Professional malpractice expense includes the losses resulting from professional liability claims and loss adjustment expense, as well as paid excess insurance premiums, and is presented within other operating expenses in the

	For purposes of estimating
	its individual claim accruals, the Company utilizes specific claim information, including the nature of the claim, the expected claim amount, the year in which the claim occurred and the laws of the jurisdiction in which the claim occurred. Once the
	case accruals for known claims are determined, information is stratified by loss layers and retentions, accident years, reported years, geography and claims relating to the acquired HMA hospitals versus claims relating to the Company&#146;s other
	hospitals. Several actuarial methods are used against this data to produce estimates of ultimate paid losses and reserves for incurred but not reported claims. Each of these methods uses company-specific historical claims data and other information.
	This company-specific data includes information regarding the Company&#146;s business, including historical paid losses and loss adjustment expenses, historical and current case loss reserves, actual and projected hospital statistical data, a
	variety of hospital census information, employed physician information, professional liability retentions for each policy year, geographic information and other data.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:2%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Based on these analyses the Company determines its estimate of the professional liability claims. The determination of management&#146;s
	estimate, including the preparation of the reserve analysis that supports such estimate, involves subjective judgment of the management. Changes in reserving data or the trends and factors that influence reserving data may signal fundamental shifts
	in the Company&#146;s future claim development patterns or may simply reflect single-period anomalies. Even if a change reflects a fundamental shift, the full extent of the change may not become evident until years later. Moreover, since the
	Company&#146;s methods and models use different types of data and the Company selects its liability from the results of all of these methods, it typically cannot quantify the precise impact of such factors on its estimates of the liability. Due to
	the Company&#146;s standardized and consistent processes for handling claims and the long history and depth of company-specific data, the Company&#146;s methodologies have produced reliably determinable estimates of ultimate paid losses.

	The Company is primarily self-insured for professional liability claims; however, the Company obtains excess insurance that transfers the risk
	of loss to a third-party insurer for claims in excess of self-insured retentions. The Company&#146;s excess insurance is underwritten on a claims-made basis. For claims reported prior to June&nbsp;1, 2002, substantially all of the Company&#146;s
	professional and general liability risks were subject to a less than $1 million per occurrence self-insured retention and for claims reported from June&nbsp;1, 2002 through June&nbsp;1, 2003, these self-insured retentions were $2 million per
	occurrence. Substantially all claims reported after June&nbsp;1, 2003 and before June&nbsp;1, 2005 are self-insured up to $4 million per claim. Substantially all claims reported on or after June&nbsp;1, 2005 and before June&nbsp;1, 2014 are
	self-insured up to $5 million per claim. Substantially all claims reported on or after June&nbsp;1, 2014 are self-insured up to $10 million per claim. Management on occasion has selectively increased the insured risk at certain hospitals based upon
	insurance pricing and other factors and may continue that practice in the future. Excess insurance for all hospitals has been purchased through commercial insurance companies and generally covers the Company for liabilities in excess of the
	self-insured retentions. The excess coverage consists of multiple layers of insurance, the sum of which totals up to $95 million per occurrence and in the aggregate for claims reported on or after June&nbsp;1, 2003, up to $145 million per occurrence
	and in the aggregate for claims reported on or after January&nbsp;1, 2008, up to $195 million per occurrence and in the aggregate for claims reported on or after June&nbsp;1, 2010, and up to $220 million per occurrence and in the aggregate for
	claims reported on or after June&nbsp;1, 2015. In addition, for integrated occurrence malpractice claims, there is an additional $50 million of excess coverage for claims reported on or after June&nbsp;1, 2014 and an additional $75 million of excess
	coverage for claims reported on or after June&nbsp;1, 2015. For certain policy years prior to June&nbsp;1, 2014, if the first aggregate layer of excess coverage becomes fully utilized, then the Company&#146;s self-insured retention will increase to
	$10 million per claim for any subsequent claims in that policy year until the Company&#146;s total aggregate coverage is met.

	Amounts owed to CVR holders are dependent on the ultimate resolution of the HMA Legal Matters and
	determination of HMA Losses incurred. The settlement of any or all of the claims and expenses incurred on behalf of the Company in defending itself will (subject to the deductible) reduce the amounts owed to the CVR holders.

	Underlying the CVR agreement are a number of claims included in the HMA Legal Matters asserted against HMA. The Company has recorded a
	liability in connection with those claims as part of the acquired assets and liabilities at the date of acquisition pursuant to the provisions of Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification Topic 805 &#147;Business
	Combinations.&#148; For the estimate of the Company&#146;s liabilities associated with the HMA Legal Matters that will be covered by the CVR and were not previously accrued by HMA, the Company recorded a liability of $284 million as part of the
	acquisition accounting for the HMA merger based on the Company&#146;s estimate of fair value of such liabilities as of the date of acquisition. The decrease in this liability during the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2015 was approximately $4 million
	and the fair value of such liabilities of $261 million as of December&nbsp;31, 2015 is recorded in other long-term liabilities on the accompanying consolidated balance sheet. As of December&nbsp;31, 2015, there is currently no accrual recorded for
	the probable contingency claims underlying the CVR agreement. The estimated liability for probable contingency claims underlying the CVR agreement that was previously recorded by HMA, and reflected in the purchase accounting for HMA as an acquired
	liability has been settled and was paid during the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2015. In addition, although legal fees are not included in the amounts currently accrued, such legal fees are taken into account in determining HMA Losses under the CVR
	agreement. Certain significant HMA Legal Matters underlying these liabilities are discussed in greater detail below.

	Meyer v. Health Management Associates, Inc. et al. (Southern District Florida) (&#147;Paul Meyer&#148;). The United States has elected to intervene with respect to allegations in these cases that certain HMA hospitals inappropriately admitted
	patients and then submitted reimbursement claims for treating those individuals to federal healthcare programs in violation of the False Claims Act or that certain HMA hospitals had inappropriate financial relationships with physicians which
	violated the Stark law, the Anti-Kickback Statute, and the False Claims Act. Certain of these complaints also allege the same actions violated various state laws which prohibit false claims. The United States has declined to intervene in three of
	the eleven matters, namely U.S. ex rel. Anita France, et al. v. Health Management Associates, Inc. (Middle District Florida) (&#147;France&#148;) which involved allegations of wrongful billing and was settled; U.S. ex rel. Sandra Simmons v. Health
	Management Associates, Inc. et al. (Eastern District Oklahoma) (&#147;Simmons&#148;) which alleges unnecessary surgery by an employed physician and which was settled as to all allegations except alleged wrongful termination; and U.S. ex rel. David
	Napoliello, M.D. v. Health Management Associates, Inc. (Middle District Florida) (&#147;Napoliello&#148;) which alleges inappropriate admissions. On April&nbsp;3, 2014, the Multi District Litigation Panel ordered the transfer and consolidation for
	pretrial proceedings of the eight intervened cases, plus the Napoliello matter, to the District of the District of Columbia under the name In Re: Health Management Associates, Inc. Qui Tam Litigation. On June&nbsp;2, 2014, the court entered a stay
	of this matter until October&nbsp;6, 2014, which was subsequently extended until February&nbsp;27, 2015,&nbsp;May&nbsp;27, 2015,&nbsp;September&nbsp;25, 2015,&nbsp;January&nbsp;25, 2016, and now until May&nbsp;25, 2016. The Company intends to defend
	against the allegations in these matters, but also continues to cooperate with the government in the ongoing investigation of these allegations. The Company has been in discussions with the Civil Division of the United States Department of Justice
	(&#147;DOJ&#148;) regarding the resolutions of these matters. During the first quarter of 2015, the Company was informed that the Criminal Division continues to investigate former executive-level employees of HMA, and continues to consider whether
	any HMA entities should be held criminally liable for the acts of the former HMA employees. The Company is voluntarily cooperating with these inquiries and has not been served with any subpoenas or other legal process.

	With respect to the &#147;Other Probable Contingencies&#148; referenced in the chart above, in accordance with

	Class Action Shareholder Federal Securities Cases
</U>
	. Three purported class action cases have been filed in the United States District
	Court for the Middle District of Tennessee; namely, Norfolk County Retirement System v. Community Health Systems, Inc., et al., filed May&nbsp;9, 2011; De Zheng v. Community Health Systems, Inc., et al., filed May&nbsp;12, 2011; and Minneapolis
	Firefighters Relief Association v. Community Health Systems, Inc., et al., filed June&nbsp;21, 2011. All three seek class certification on behalf of purchasers of the Company&#146;s common stock between July&nbsp;27, 2006 and April&nbsp;11, 2011 and
	allege that misleading statements resulted in artificially inflated prices for the Company&#146;s common stock. In December 2011, the cases were consolidated for pretrial purposes and NYC Funds and its counsel were selected as lead plaintiffs/lead
	plaintiffs&#146; counsel. In lieu of ruling on the Company&#146;s motion to dismiss, the court permitted the plaintiffs to file a first amended consolidated class action complaint, which was filed on October&nbsp;5, 2015. The Company&#146;s motion
	to dismiss was filed on November&nbsp;4, 2015 and is scheduled for oral argument on April&nbsp;11, 2016. The court also lifted the discovery stay and discovery is underway. The Company believes this consolidated matter is without merit and will
	vigorously defend this case.

	Shareholder Derivative Actions
</U>
	. Three purported shareholder derivative actions have also been filed
	in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Tennessee; Plumbers and Pipefitters Local Union No.&nbsp;630 Pension Annuity Trust Fund v. Wayne T. Smith, et al., filed May&nbsp;24, 2011; Roofers Local No.&nbsp;149 Pension Fund v.
	Wayne T. Smith, et al., filed June&nbsp;21, 2011; and Lambert Sweat v. Wayne T. Smith, et al., filed October&nbsp;5, 2011. These three cases allege breach of fiduciary duty arising out of allegedly improper inpatient admission practices,
	mismanagement, waste and unjust enrichment. These cases have been consolidated into a single, consolidated action. The plaintiffs filed an operative amended derivative complaint in these three consolidated actions on March&nbsp;15, 2012. The
	Company&#146;s motion to dismiss was argued on June&nbsp;13, 2013. On September&nbsp;27, 2013, the court issued an order granting in part and denying in part the Company&#146;s motion to dismiss. An initial case management order was entered on
	November&nbsp;11, 2014, but no trial date has been set. Discovery is continuing. The Company believes all of the plaintiffs&#146; claims are without merit and will vigorously defend them.

	The Company&#146;s intercompany activity consists primarily of daily cash transfers for purposes of cash management, the allocation of certain
	expenses and expenditures paid for by the Parent on behalf of its subsidiaries, and the push down of investment in its subsidiaries. This activity also includes the intercompany transactions between consolidated entities as part of the Receivables
	Facility that is further discussed in Note 7. The Company&#146;s subsidiaries generally do not purchase services from one another; thus, the intercompany transactions do not represent revenue generating transactions. All intercompany transactions
	eliminate in consolidation.

</B>
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:2%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	We are responsible for the preparation and integrity of the consolidated financial statements appearing in our Annual Report on Form 10-K. The
	consolidated financial statements were prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and include amounts based on management&#146;s estimates and judgments. All other financial information in
	this report has been presented on a basis consistent with the information included in the consolidated financial statements.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:2%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	We are also
	responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal controls over financial reporting (as defined in Rule&nbsp;13a-15(f) under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended). We maintain a system of internal controls that is
	designed to provide reasonable assurance as to the fair and reliable preparation and presentation of the consolidated financial statements, as well as to safeguard assets from unauthorized use or disposition.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:2%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Our control environment is the foundation for our system of internal control over financial reporting and is embodied in our Code of Conduct.
	It sets the tone of our organization and includes factors such as integrity and ethical values. Our internal control over financial reporting is supported by formal policies and procedures which are reviewed, modified and improved as changes occur
	in business conditions and operations.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:2%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The Audit and Compliance Committee of the Board of Directors, which is composed solely of outside
	directors, meets periodically with members of management, the internal auditors and the independent registered public accounting firm to review and discuss internal control over financial reporting and accounting and financial reporting matters. The
	independent registered public accounting firm and internal auditors report to the Audit and Compliance Committee and have full and free access to the Audit and Compliance Committee at any time.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:2%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	We conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in
<I>
	Internal Control
	- Integrated Framework (2013)
</I>
	&nbsp;issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. This evaluation included review of the documentation of controls, evaluation of the design effectiveness of controls, testing of
	the operating effectiveness of controls and a conclusion on this evaluation. We have concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December&nbsp;31, 2015, based on these criteria.

	Deloitte&nbsp;&amp; Touche LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, has issued an attestation report on our internal control
	over financial reporting, which is included herein.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:2%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	We do not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal controls
	will prevent all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must
	reflect the fact there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all
	control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected.

	We have audited the
	internal control over financial reporting of Community Health Systems, Inc. and subsidiaries (the &#147;Company&#148;) as of December&nbsp;31, 2015, based on criteria established in Internal Control &#150; Integrated Framework (2013)&nbsp;issued by
	the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. The Company&#146;s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control
	over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management&#146;s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company&#146;s internal control over financial reporting based on our
	audit.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require
	that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over
	financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in
	the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	A company&#146;s internal control over financial reporting is a
	process designed by, or under the supervision of, the company&#146;s principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the company&#146;s board of directors, management, and other
	personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company&#146;s internal
	control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1)&nbsp;pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company;
	(2)&nbsp;provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles , and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being
	made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3)&nbsp;provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company&#146;s assets
	that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting,
	including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the
	internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December&nbsp;31, 2015, based on
	the criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013)&nbsp;issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.

	Accounting Standards Update 2015-17 Income Taxes (Topic 740): Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes in 2015); such reports are included elsewhere in this Form 10-K. Our audits also included the consolidated financial statement schedule of
