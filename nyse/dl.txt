	parts of this annual report, any Renminbi denominated amounts are accompanied by translations. With respect to amounts not recorded in our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report, all translations from Renminbi to
	U.S. dollars were made at the noon buying rate in the City of New York for cable transfers in Renminbi per U.S. dollar as certified for customs purposes by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. Unless otherwise noted, all translations from Renminbi
	to U.S. dollars have been made at RMB6.6685 to $1.00, the noon buying rate in effect as of September&nbsp;30, 2016. We make no representation that the Renminbi or U.S. dollar amounts referred to in this annual report could have been or could be
	converted into U.S. dollars or Renminbi, as the case may be, at any particular rate or at all. The PRC government restricts or prohibits the conversion of Renminbi into foreign currency and foreign currency into Renminbi for certain types of
	transactions. On January&nbsp;13, 2017, the noon buying rate was RMB6.8985 to $1.00.

	The continued success and growth of our business depends primarily on the number of enrollments in our courses and the amount of course fees
	that we can charge. This in turn will depend on several factors, including our ability to develop new courses and improve existing courses to respond to changes in market trends and demands of course participants, to effectively market our courses
	to a broader base of prospective course participants, to train and retain qualified lecturers and tutors, to develop or acquire additional high-quality educational content and to respond to competitive pressures. In addition, the expansion of our
	courses, services and products in terms of the types of offerings may not succeed due to competition, our failure to effectively market our new courses, services and products or to maintain their quality and consistency, or other factors.
	Furthermore, we may not be able to develop and offer additional content on commercially reasonable terms and in a timely manner, or at all, to keep pace with changes in market requirements. If we are unable to continue to attract course participants
	to enroll in our courses, increase enrollments in our relatively new courses, or charge competitive but profitable fees, our revenues may decline and we may be unable to achieve revenue growth or maintain our profitability.

	Historically, our core business centered on the provision of online professional education and test preparation courses for accounting
	professionals. We have since expanded our course offerings to target course participants in the healthcare, engineering&nbsp;&amp; construction, and other industries, as well as other forms of online and offline education. In addition to regular
	classes, we have also introduced, in the past few years, &#147;elite&#148; classes and &#147;premium&#148; classes within some of our most popular course offerings to better serve the needs of
<FONT STYLE="WHITE-SPACE:NOWRAP">
	high-end
</FONT>
	course
	participants. The profitability of the elite and premium classes may be subject to risks given that the course participants enjoy refund or discount privileges if certain
<FONT STYLE="WHITE-SPACE:NOWRAP">
	pre-agreed
</FONT>
	conditions are met. We also
	offer business
<FONT STYLE="WHITE-SPACE:NOWRAP">
	start-up
</FONT>
	training courses, which are subsidized by the PRC government, the profitability of which may be subject to risks given that the subsidy we are entitled to receive from the government in
	certain provinces and cities may be reduced if certain stipulated conditions in the government&#146;s subsidy policies are not met. In May, 2015, we launched our College Cooperation Program, which enables us to expand our industry-leading accounting
	educational content and services to college and university students, in partnership with colleges and universities. Our acquisition of Xiamen NetinNet in May 2016 further complements our suite of learning solutions for the growing College
	Cooperation Program, and enables us to offer comprehensive simulation-based learning content to college students to master critical accounting skills. We intend to continue developing new courses, services and products. The timing of the
	introduction of new courses, services and products is subject to risks and uncertainties.

	In addition, if competent government authorities decide to cancel certain professional qualifications or certificates, our business relating
	to the relevant course offerings would be materially and adversely affected. For example, the PRC State Council promulgated a decision in August 2014, pursuant to which various professional qualifications or certificates, including the Registered
	Tax Agent, or RTA, and Certified Asset Appraiser Qualification, were cancelled or replaced with a qualification evaluation system administered by the State Council. As a result, the number of our course enrollments and, therefore, revenues generated
	from our course offerings for these professional qualifications or certificates were adversely affected in the fiscal year ended September&nbsp;30, 2015. In November 2015, the RTA Qualification Exam was officially changed to the Tax Agent
	Qualification Exam and was held at the end of February 2016, and will be held during November of each year thereafter. Starting from late November of 2016, the Department of Finance in certain provinces and cities has suspended the Accounting
	Certificate Examination due to the proposed changes to the related examination policy. Such suspension may adversely impact our revenue in fiscal year 2017. In December 2016, the State Council further cancelled 114 professional licenses. If the PRC
	government further cancels more professional licenses that impact our course offerings or strategic priorities or there are any material changes in the professional qualification licensing and identification in our course offerings, and we are

	The internet industry is facing significant challenges regarding information security and privacy, including the

	We are required by PRC law to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, availability and authenticity of the information of our course
	participants, which is also essential to maintain their confidence in our online products and services. We have deployed hardware-software combined measures to protect information security. However, advances in technology, increased level of
	expertise of hackers, new discoveries in the field of cryptography or others could still result in a compromise or breach of the measures that we use. On December&nbsp;28, 2012, the Standing Committee of the National People&#146;s Congress
	(&#147;SCNPC&#148;) promulgated the Decision to Strengthen the Protection of Internet Information, or the Information Protection Decision, to strengthen the protection of personal information on the Internet. The Information Protection Decision
	provides that the Internet content providers must expressly inform their users of the purpose, manner to collect and use the users&#146; personal information and the scope of the information to be collected and used by the provider. In addition, the
	Internet content providers can collect and use the user&#146;s personal information only with the consent of users and only within the scope of such consent. On July&nbsp;16, 2013, China&#146;s Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, or
	MIIT, promulgated the Provisions on the Protection of Personal Information of Telecommunication and Internet Users, which defines &#147;Personal Information&#148; as the information that can be used individually or in combination with other
	information to identify the users, including but not limited to the name, birth date, ID No., address, telephone number and account number and the information about when and where the user uses such telecommunication and internet service. However,
	the effect of these laws on curbing hacking and other illegal online activities still remains to be seen. Significant capital, managerial and human resources are required to comply with legal requirements, enhance information security and to address
	any issues caused by security failures. If we are unable to protect our systems, hence the information stored in our systems, from unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification or destruction, such problems or security breaches
	could cause loss or give rise to our liabilities to the owners of confidential information, such as our course participants, subject us to penalties imposed by administrative authorities, and disrupt our operations. In addition, complying with
	various laws and regulations could cause us to incur substantial costs or require us to change our business practices, including our data practices, in a manner adverse to our business.

	Furthermore, course participants and others may have concerns about whether our products, services or processes could compromise the privacy
	of users and others. Concerns about our practices with regard to the collection, use, disclosure, or security of personal information or other privacy related matters, and any negative publicity on our information safety or privacy protection
	mechanism and policy, even if unfounded, could damage our reputation and brand and adversely affect our business and results of operations.

	Public concerns over the security and privacy of electronic settlement, online transmittal and communications have to some
	extent constrained the rapid development and expansion of online transactions. If these concerns are not adequately addressed, they will restrict the growth of value-added telecommunications services generally and in particular the use of the
	Internet as a means of conducting commercial transactions. If a well-publicized breach of security were to occur, general usage of value-added telecommunications services could decline, which could reduce our visitor traffic and the number of course
	participants, and impede our growth. We are continuously vigilant about protecting and improving our cyber security and have not experienced any material cyber attacks on our information technology systems. We cannot assure you, however, that our
	current security measures will be adequate or sufficient to prevent any theft or misuse of personal data of our course participants. Further, security breaches could expose us to litigation and possible liability for failing to secure confidential
	customer information, and could harm our reputation and ability to attract or retain course participants. In addition, we do not have any cyber security insurance coverage for our operations, and any material cyber attack on our information

	Foreign ownership of Internet-based businesses is subject to significant restrictions under current PRC laws and
	regulations. The PRC government regulates Internet access, the distribution of online information and the conduct of online commerce through strict business licensing requirements and other government regulations. These laws and regulations also
	include limitations on foreign ownership in PRC companies that provide Internet content distribution services. Specifically, foreign investors in most areas of the PRC (including the areas where we have operations) are not allowed to own more than
	50% equity interests in any entity conducting Internet content distribution business.

	Because we are a Cayman Islands company and we hold
	the equity interests of our PRC subsidiaries indirectly through China Distance Education Limited, a Hong Kong company, or CDEL Hong Kong and China Healthcare Education Limited, a Hong Kong company, or China Healthcare Education, our PRC subsidiaries
	are treated as foreign invested enterprises under PRC laws and regulations. To comply with PRC laws and regulations, we conduct our operations in China through a series of contractual arrangements entered into among CDEL Hong Kong, our three PRC
	subsidiaries, Beijing Champion Distance Education Technology Co., Ltd., or Champion Technology, Beijing Champion Education Technology Co., Ltd., or Champion Education Technology and Beijing Zhongxi Champion Healthcare Education Technology Co., Ltd.,
	or Zhongxi Healthcare Education, our affiliated PRC entities, Beijing Champion and Champion Healthcare Education, and their respective shareholders. Each of Beijing Champion and Champion Healthcare Education is a PRC limited liability company 79%

	and deputy chairman, both of whom are PRC citizens. Beijing Champion holds
	a Telecommunications and Information Services Operating License, or ICP license, issued by the Beijing Telecommunications Administration Bureau, a local branch of MIIT, which allows Beijing Champion to provide Internet content distribution services.
	Each of Beijing Caikaowang Company Limited, or Caikaowang, and Beijing Champion Wangge Education Technology Co., Ltd., or Champion Wangge, holds an ICP license issued by the Beijing Telecommunications Administration Bureau. In addition, Beijing
	Champion holds a Permit of Internet Cultural Activities issued by the Beijing Municipal Bureau of Culture, which permits Beijing Champion to engage in production and dissemination of musical and entertainment products and animated products through
	the Internet. The ICP licenses and other approvals held by Beijing Champion and its subsidiaries are essential to the operation of our business.

	The relevant PRC regulatory

	Telecommunications Services, or the MIIT Notice. The MIIT Notice prohibits a domestic telecommunications service provider from leasing, transferring or selling telecommunications business operating licenses to any foreign investor in any form, or
	providing any resources, sites or facilities to any foreign investor for its illegal operation of a telecommunications business in China. According to the MIIT Notice, either the holder of a value-added telecommunications service license or its
	shareholders must directly own the domain names and trademarks used by such license holder in its provision of value-added telecommunications services. The MIIT Notice also requires each license holder to have the necessary facilities, including
	servers, for its approved business operations and to maintain such facilities in the regions covered by its license. In order to comply with the MIIT Notice, we have transferred all domain names and trademarks that are primarily used in connection
	with our online business activities from Champion Technology to Beijing Champion.

	the related Powers of Attorney and Letter of Undertaking, are governed by PRC law, and most of these agreements (excluding the Powers of Attorney) provide for the resolution of disputes through arbitration before the China International Economic and
	Trade Arbitration Center, or CIETAC, in Beijing. Accordingly, these contracts would be interpreted in accordance with PRC law and any disputes arising from these arrangements would be resolved through arbitration before CIETAC or, in the case of
	disputes arising from the Powers of Attorney or Letter of Undertaking, through litigation in the PRC, in each case in accordance with PRC legal procedures. Furthermore, although CIETAC may award the same type of relief to the prevailing party in an
	arbitration proceeding as that granted by a court in a civil action, CIETAC does not have the authority to enforce arbitral awards. In the event that we prevail in an arbitration proceeding before CIETAC, we may nevertheless have to apply to a PRC
	court for the enforcement of the arbitral award relating to the contractual arrangements. The legal environment in the PRC may not be as developed as in some other jurisdictions, such as the United States. See &#147;&#151;General Risks Relating to
	Conducting Business in China &#151;The PRC legal system embodies uncertainties that could limit the legal protections available to you and us

	As a result, although the enforceability of the contractual arrangements may
	not be affected, the manner of enforcement may be unclear. In the event that we are unable to enforce these contractual arrangements to the fullest extent, we may not be able to exert effective control over our affiliated entities, and our ability
	to conduct our business would be materially and adversely affected.

	prohibited from making an agreement prior to the expiration of the debt performance period to transfer the ownership of the pledged equity to the pledgee when the obligor fails to pay the debt due. However, under the PRC Property Law, when an

	Due to uncertainties with respect to the interpretation and application of the Internet
	Audio-Video Program Measures, each year, we and our PRC counsel consult the Beijing Branch of SAPPRFT, or Beijing SAPPRFT, which is the competent authority in Beijing to grant the License for Disseminating Audio-Video Programs through Information
	Network, regarding whether online education services providers like us that provide audio-video educational courses and programs through the Internet only to enrolled course participants should apply for the said license. Prior to 2011, the
	officials in Beijing SAPPRFT consistently conveyed to us that we were not required to apply for the said license as we only transmit audio-video educational courses and programs through the Internet to enrolled course participants instead of the
	general public. However, in January 2011, a joint administrative enforcement commission of the Beijing government (including Beijing SAPPRFT) issued a warning to us and fined us RMB6,000 ($897) for providing audio-video educational courses without
	obtaining the License for Disseminating Audio-Video Programs through Information Network. Thereafter, we submitted our application for such license to Beijing SAPPRFT. On August&nbsp;1, 2011, Beijing SAPPRFT sent us an official response stating that
	it determined that we are not required to obtain the License for Disseminating Audio-Video Programs because our numerous education-related activities do not fall under the &#147;Internet audio-visual services program.&#148; We cannot guarantee that
	Beijing SAPPRFT will not change its position or that the reply will not be challenged by higher authorities in China, or that we will not be asked to obtain the said license again. If the regulatory authorities take any such action against us, it

	The PRC economy differs from the economies of most developed
	countries in many respects, including the amount of government involvement, level of development, growth rate, control of foreign exchange and allocation of resources. While the PRC economy has experienced significant growth in the past two to three
	decades, growth has been uneven, both geographically and among various sectors of the economy. Demand for our products and services depends, in large part, on economic conditions in China. Any slowdown in China&#146;s economic growth may cause our
	potential course participants to delay or cancel their plans to participate in our education courses, which in turn could reduce our net revenues.

	Although the PRC economy has been transitioning from a planned economy to a more market-oriented economy since the late 1970s, the PRC
	government continues to play a significant role in regulating industry development by imposing industrial policies. The PRC government also exercises significant control over China&#146;s economic growth through the allocation of resources,
	controlling the incurrence and payment of foreign currency-denominated obligations, setting monetary policy and providing preferential treatment to particular industries or companies. Changes in any of these policies, laws and regulations could
	adversely affect the overall economy in China or the prospects of the education market, which could harm our business.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The PRC government
	has implemented various measures to encourage foreign investment and sustainable economic growth and to guide the allocation of financial and other resources. While some of these measures benefit the overall PRC economy, they may also have a
	negative effect on us. For example, our financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected by government control over capital investments, stricter employment policies for particular industries or changes in tax regulations that
	are applicable to us. As the PRC economy is increasingly intricately linked to the global economy, it is affected in various respects by downturns and recessions of major economies around the world, such as the past financial services and economic
	crises of these economies. The various economic and policy measures the PRC government adopts to forestall economic downturns or shore up the PRC economy may adversely affect our business. We cannot assure you that the PRC government will not repeal
	or alter these measures or introduce new measures that will have a negative effect on us.

	China&#146;s social and political conditions
	are also not as stable as those of the United States and other developed countries. Any sudden changes to China&#146;s political system or the occurrence of widespread social unrest could have negative effects on our business and results of
	operations. In addition, China has tumultuous relations with some of its neighbors and a significant further deterioration in such relations could have negative effects on the PRC economy and lead to changes in governmental policies that would be

	Unlike common law systems,
	the PRC legal system is based on written statutes and decided legal cases have little precedential value. In 1979, the PRC government began to promulgate a comprehensive system of laws and regulations governing economic matters. The overall effect
	of legislation since then has been to significantly enhance the protections afforded to various forms of foreign investment in China. Three of our PRC operating subsidiaries, Champion Technology, Champion Education Technology and Zhongxi Healthcare
	Education, are wholly foreign-owned enterprises, and all are subject to laws and regulations applicable to foreign investment in China in general and laws and regulations applicable to wholly foreign-owned enterprises in particular. Our other PRC
	operating subsidiaries and PRC affiliated entities are subject to laws and regulations governing the formation and conduct of domestic PRC companies. Relevant PRC laws, regulations and legal requirements may change frequently, and their
	interpretation and enforcement involve uncertainties. For example, the Ministry of Commerce published the draft Foreign Investment Law for public comments on January&nbsp;19, 2015, with the intention of reducing regulation of foreign investment in
	general while also attempting to regulate new types of foreign investment in China, including those utilizing variable interest entity structure. We utilize variable interest entities in our group structure and may be subject to stricter regulation
	if the Foreign Investment Law comes into effect. In addition, we may have to resort to administrative and court proceedings to enforce the legal protection that we enjoy either by law or contract. However, since PRC administrative and court
	authorities have significant discretion in interpreting and implementing statutory terms, it may be more difficult to evaluate the outcome of administrative and court proceedings and the level of legal protection we enjoy than under more developed
	legal systems. Such uncertainties, including the inability to enforce our contracts and intellectual property rights, could materially and adversely affect our business and operations. Accordingly, we cannot predict the effect of future developments
	in the PRC legal system, particularly with respect to the education sector, including the promulgation of new laws, changes to existing laws or the interpretation or enforcement thereof, or the preemption of local regulations by national laws. These
	uncertainties could adversely impact our corporate structure and business and limit the legal protections available to us and other foreign investors.

	We report our financial results in U.S. dollars, and appreciation or depreciation in the value of the Renminbi (which is the currency in which

	future.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The Renminbi&#146;s exchange rate with the U.S. dollar and other currencies is affected by, among other things, changes in
	China&#146;s political and economic conditions and China&#146;s foreign exchange policies. The People&#146;s Bank of China regularly intervenes in the foreign exchange market to limit fluctuations in Renminbi exchange rate and achieve certain
	exchange rate targets, and through such intervention kept the U.S. dollar-Renminbi exchange rate relatively stable within a very narrow range against the U.S. dollar (remaining within 1% of its July 2008 high) for almost two years from July 2008. On
	June&nbsp;20, 2010, the People&#146;s Bank of China announced that the PRC government would further reform the Renminbi exchange rate regime and increase the flexibility of the exchange rate. On March&nbsp;15, 2014, the People&#146;s Bank of China
	announced that it further expanded the daily RMB against U.S. dollar trading band of the inter-bank spot foreign exchange market from 1% to 2% as of March&nbsp;17, 2014, to allow Renminbi to move more freely and better reflect market supply and
	demand. On August&nbsp;11, 12 and 13, 2015, the People&#146;s Bank of China significantly devalued the Renminbi by fixing its price against the U.S. dollar 1.9%, 1.6%, and 1.1% lower than the previous day&#146;s value, respectively. The value of the
	Renminbi depreciated approximately 5.8% against the U.S. dollar in 2015, and from December&nbsp;31, 2015 through January&nbsp;13, 2017, the value of Renminbi further depreciated approximately 6.1% against the U.S. dollar. It is difficult to predict
	how market forces or PRC or U.S. government policy may impact the exchange rate between the Renminbi and the U.S. dollar in the future. There remains significant international pressure on the PRC government to adopt a substantial liberalization of
	its currency policy, which could result in a further and more significant change in the value of the Renminbi against the U.S. dollar. Very limited hedging transactions are available in China to reduce our exposure to exchange rate fluctuations. To
	date, we have not entered into any hedging transactions in an effort to reduce our exposure to foreign currency exchange risk. While we may decide to enter into hedging transactions in the future, the availability and effectiveness of these hedging
	transactions may be limited and we may not be able to successfully hedge our exposure at all. In addition, our currency exchange losses may be magnified by PRC exchange control regulations that restrict our ability to convert Renminbi into foreign
	currency.

	In March 2007, the
	National People&#146;s Congress enacted the Enterprise Income Tax Law, or the EIT Law, and in December 2007, the State Council promulgated the implementation rules of the EIT Law, both of which became effective on January&nbsp;1, 2008. The EIT Law
	significantly curtails tax incentives granted to foreign-invested enterprises under the previous tax law. The EIT Law, however, (i)&nbsp;reduces the statutory rate of enterprise income tax from 33% to 25%, (ii)&nbsp;permits companies to continue to
	enjoy their existing tax incentives, subject to certain transitional
<FONT STYLE="WHITE-SPACE:NOWRAP">
	phase-out
</FONT>
	rules, and (iii)&nbsp;introduces new tax incentives, subject to various qualification criteria. The EIT Law and its implementing
	rules permit qualified &#147;high and new technology enterprises&#148; to enjoy a reduced 15% EIT rate. The qualification criteria are significantly higher than those prescribed by the old tax rules. Beijing Champion and Champion Technology obtained
	the qualification certificates of high and new technology enterprises under the EIT Law on December&nbsp;24, 2008 with a valid period of three years starting from January&nbsp;1, 2008 and renewed the certificates in 2011 and 2014, respectively, for
	another three years. As a result, Beijing Champion was subject to the tax rate of 15% from 2008 through 2016. Champion Technology was subject to the tax rate of 7.5% for 2008 through 2009 and was subject to 15% from 2010 through 2016. In addition,
	Zhengbao Yucai obtained the qualification certificate of high and new technology enterprise under the EIT Law on November&nbsp;12, 2012 with a valid period of three years starting from January&nbsp;1, 2012, and renewed the certificate in 2015 for
	another three years. As a result, Zhengbao Yucai was and will be subject to the tax rate of 15% from 2012 through 2017. Furthermore, our newly acquired Xiamen NetinNet obtained the qualification certificate of high and new technology enterprise
	under the EIT Law on September&nbsp;30, 2014 with a valid period of three years starting from January&nbsp;1, 2014. As a result, Xiamen NetinNet was subject to the tax rate of 15% from 2014 through 2016. The continued qualification of a high and new
	technology enterprise will be subject to annual evaluation and a three-year review by the relevant government authority in China. The PRC tax policies, interpretations, and practices regarding the overlap,
<FONT STYLE="WHITE-SPACE:NOWRAP">

</FONT>
	and transition of preferential treatments is subject to continuous change and uncertainty and we cannot assure you that Beijing Champion, Champion Technology, Zhengbao Yucai and Xiamen NetinNet will

<FONT STYLE="WHITE-SPACE:NOWRAP">

	Under the EIT
	Law, an enterprise established outside of China with &#147;de facto management bodies&#148; within China is considered a &#147;resident enterprise,&#148; and will generally be subject to the uniform 25% PRC enterprise income tax rate on its global
	income. The implementing rules of the EIT Law define de facto management as &#147;substantial and overall management and control over the production and operations, personnel, accounting, and properties&#148; of the enterprise. A circular issued by
	the State Administration of Taxation ( the &#147;SAT&#148;), or Circular 82, on April&nbsp;22, 2009 provides that a foreign enterprise controlled by a PRC company or a PRC company group will be classified as a &#147;resident enterprise&#148; with
	its &#147;de facto management bodies&#148; located within China if the following requirements are satisfied: (i)&nbsp;the senior management and core management departments in charge of its daily operations function are mainly in the PRC;
	(ii)&nbsp;its financial and human resources decisions are subject to determination or approval by persons or bodies in the PRC; (iii)&nbsp;its major assets, accounting books, company seals, and minutes and files of its board and shareholders&#146;
	meetings are located or kept in the PRC; and (iv)&nbsp;at least half of the enterprise&#146;s directors with voting rights or senior management reside in the PRC. In addition, the SAT issued the Announcement of the SAT on Printing and Distributing
	the Administrative Measures for Overseas Registered Chinese-capital Controlled Tax Resident Enterprises (Trial), the Announcement 45, on July&nbsp;27, 2011, effective September&nbsp;1, 2011, providing more guidance on the implementation of Circular
	82. Announcement 45 clarifies matters including residence status determination, post-determination administration and competent tax authorities. Furthermore, the SAT issued a bulletin on January&nbsp;29, 2014, to provide more guidance on the
	implementation of Circular 82. This bulletin further provided that, among other things, an entity that is classified as a &#147;resident enterprise&#148; in accordance with Circular 82 shall file the application for classifying its status of
	residential enterprise with the local tax authorities where its main domestic investors registered. From the year in which the entity is determined as a &#147;resident enterprise&#148;, any dividend, profit and other equity investment gain shall be
	taxed in accordance with the Article 26 of EIT law and the Article 17 and Article 83 of its implementation rules.

	Our management is
	currently based in China and expected to remain in China. However, Circular 82 and Announcement 45 only apply to offshore enterprises controlled by PRC enterprises or PRC enterprise groups, not those controlled by PRC individuals or foreign
	corporations like us. In the absence of detailed implementing regulations or other guidance determining that offshore companies controlled by PRC individuals or foreign corporations like us are PRC resident enterprises, we do not currently consider
	CDEL Cayman to be a PRC resident enterprise. However, the SAT may take the view that the determining criteria set forth in Circular 82 and Announcement 45 reflect general position on how the &#147;de facto management body&#148; test should be
	applied in determining the tax resident status of all offshore enterprises. Or additional implementing regulations or guidance may be issued determining that CDEL Cayman is a &#147;resident enterprise&#148; for PRC enterprise income tax purposes.
	The &#147;resident enterprise&#148; rule could be applied to all of our overseas subsidiaries with similar consequences. If the PRC tax authorities determine that CDEL Cayman and all of our overseas subsidiaries are &#147;resident enterprises&#148;
	for PRC enterprise income tax purposes, a number of unfavorable PRC tax consequences could follow. First, we may be subject to enterprise income tax at a rate of 25% on our worldwide taxable income, as well as PRC enterprise income tax reporting
	obligations. Second, although under the EIT Law and its implementing rules, a dividend income between qualified resident enterprises is a
<FONT STYLE="WHITE-SPACE:NOWRAP">
	&#147;tax-exempt
</FONT>
	income,&#148; we cannot guarantee that dividends paid
	to CDEL Cayman from our PRC subsidiaries through CDEL Hong Kong and China Healthcare Education would qualify as
<FONT STYLE="WHITE-SPACE:NOWRAP">

	income&#148; and will not be subject to withholding tax, as the PRC foreign
	exchange control authorities, which enforce the withholding tax, have not yet issued guidance with respect to the processing of outbound remittances to entities that are treated as &#147;resident enterprises&#148; for PRC enterprise income tax
	purposes. Finally, the new &#147;resident enterprise&#148; classification could result in a situation in which a 10% withholding tax is imposed on dividends we pay to our
<FONT STYLE="WHITE-SPACE:NOWRAP">

</FONT>

	Under the EIT Law and its implementing rules, dividends generated
	from retained earnings after January&nbsp;1, 2008 from a PRC company and distributed to a foreign parent company are subject to a withholding tax rate of 10% unless the foreign parent&#146;s jurisdiction of incorporation has a tax treaty with China
	that provides for a preferential withholding arrangement. Pursuant to the Arrangement between Mainland China and the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with respect to Taxes
	on Income, or the Hong Kong Tax Treaty, which became effective on January&nbsp;1, 2007, a company incorporated in Hong Kong, such as CDEL Hong Kong and China Healthcare Education, will be subject to withholding income tax at a rate of 5% on
	dividends it receives from its PRC subsidiaries if it holds a 25% or more interest in those particular PRC subsidiaries, or 10% if it holds less than a 25% interest in those subsidiaries. However, the SAT promulgated a tax notice on October&nbsp;27,

	On August&nbsp;8, 2006, six PRC regulatory agencies, including
	the CSRC, promulgated the Regulation on Mergers and Acquisitions of Domestic Companies by Foreign Investors, or the M&amp;A Rule, which became effective on September&nbsp;8, 2006, and was amended on June&nbsp;22, 2009. The M&amp;A Rule, among other
	things, has certain provisions that require offshore special purpose vehicles, or SPVs, formed for the purpose of acquiring PRC domestic companies and controlled by PRC individuals, to obtain the approval of the CSRC prior to listing their
	securities on an overseas stock exchange. We believe, based on the opinion of our PRC legal counsel, Jingtian&nbsp;&amp; Gongcheng, that while the CSRC generally has jurisdiction over overseas listings of SPVs like us, CSRC&#146;s approval was not
	required for our initial public offering given the fact that our current corporate structure was established before the new regulation became effective. However, there remains some uncertainty as to how this regulation will be interpreted or
	implemented in the context of an overseas offering. If the CSRC or another PRC regulatory agency subsequently determines that its approval was required for our initial public offering, we may face sanctions by the CSRC or another PRC regulatory
	agency. If this happens, these regulatory agencies may impose fines and penalties on our operations in the PRC, limit our operating activities in the PRC, delay or restrict capital contribution or shareholder loans by us to our PRC subsidiaries,
	restrict or prohibit payment or remittance of dividends by our PRC subsidiaries to us or take other actions that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, reputation and prospects, as well as

	Any loans we make to our PRC subsidiaries cannot exceed statutory limits and must be registered
	with the State Administration of Foreign Exchange, or SAFE, or its local counterparts. Under applicable PRC law, the government authorities must approve a foreign-invested enterprise&#146;s registered capital amount, which represents the total
	amount of capital contributions made by the shareholders that have been registered with the registration authorities. In addition, the authorities must also approve the foreign-invested enterprise&#146;s total investment, which represents the total
	statutory capitalization of the company, equal to the company&#146;s registered capital plus the amount of loans it is permitted to borrow under the law. The ratio of registered capital to total investment cannot be lower than the minimum statutory
	requirement and the excess of the total investment over the registered capital represents the maximum amount of borrowings that a foreign invested enterprise is permitted to have under PRC law. If we were to make loans to our PRC subsidiaries, we
	would have to apply to the relevant government authorities for an increase in their permitted total investment amounts. The various applications could be time-consuming and their outcomes may be uncertain. Furthermore, even if we make loans to our
	PRC subsidiaries that do not exceed their current maximum amount of borrowings, we will have to register each loan with SAFE or its local counterpart for the issuance of a registration certificate of foreign debts. In practice, it could be
	time-consuming to complete such SAFE registration process. Concurrently with the loans, we might have to make capital contributions to these subsidiaries to maintain the statutory minimum registered capital and total investment ratio, and such
	capital contributions involve uncertainties of their own. Further, SAFE promulgated a circular (known as Circular 19) on March&nbsp;30, 2015 with respect to the management approach regarding the settlement of foreign exchange capital of
	foreign-invested enterprises. Circular 19 permits foreign-invested enterprises to carry out domestic equity investment with the capital obtained from foreign exchange settlement. Circular 19 also stipulates that the capital of foreign-invested
	enterprises and capital in Renminbi obtained by them from foreign exchange settlement shall not be used for (i)&nbsp;the payment beyond the business scope of the enterprises or the payment prohibited by national laws and regulations;
	(ii)&nbsp;investment in securities unless otherwise provided by laws and regulations; (iii)&nbsp;granting entrustment loans in Renminbi (unless permitted by the scope of business), repaying the inter-enterprise borrowings (including advances by the
	third party) or repaying the bank loans in Renminbi that have been

	to the third party; and (iv)&nbsp;paying the expenses related to the purchase of real estate not for
<FONT STYLE="WHITE-SPACE:NOWRAP">

</FONT>
	except for the foreign-invested real estate enterprises. In addition, SAFE promulgated Circular 59 on November&nbsp;19, 2012 and revised the same on May&nbsp;4, 2015, which requires the authenticity
	of settlement of the fund from offshore offerings to be closely examined and such fund to be settled in the manner described in the offering documents. Because our PRC affiliated entities are domestic PRC entities, we are not likely to finance their
	activities by means of direct capital contributions due to regulatory issues relating to foreign investment in the online education industry, as well as the licensing and other regulatory issues discussed in &#147;Item 4.B. Information on the
	Company &#151; Business Overview &#151; Regulations&#148;. Any loans we make to any of our PRC affiliated entities, which is treated as a PRC domestic company rather than a foreign-invested enterprise under PRC law, are also subject to various PRC

	Starting in 2011, the Chinese affiliates of the &#147;big four&#148; accounting firms, including our independent registered public accounting
	firm, were affected by a conflict between US and Chinese law. Specifically, for certain U.S. listed companies operating and audited in mainland China, the SEC and the PCAOB sought to obtain from the Chinese firms access to their audit work papers
	and related documents. The firms were, however, advised and directed that under China law they could not respond directly to the US regulators on those requests, and that requests by foreign regulators for access to such papers in China had to be
	channeled through the China Securities Regulatory Commission, or the CSRC.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	In late 2012, this impasse led the SEC to commence
	administrative proceedings under Rule 102(e) of its Rules of Practice and also under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 against the Chinese accounting firms, including our independent registered public accounting firm. A first instance trial of the
	proceedings in July 2013 in the SEC&#146;s internal administrative court resulted in an adverse judgment against the firms. The administrative law judge proposed penalties on the firms including a temporary suspension of their right to practice
	before the SEC, although that proposed penalty did not take effect pending review by the Commissioners of the SEC. On February&nbsp;6, 2015, before a review by the Commissioner had taken place, the firms reached a settlement with the SEC. Under the
	settlement, the SEC accepts that future requests by the SEC for the production of documents will normally be made to the CSRC. The firms will receive matching Section&nbsp;106 requests, and are required to abide by a detailed set of procedures with
	respect to such requests, which in substance require them to facilitate production via the CSRC. If they fail to meet specified criteria, the SEC retains authority to impose a variety of additional remedial measures on the firms depending on the
	nature of the failure. Remedies for any future noncompliance could include, as appropriate, an automatic
<FONT STYLE="WHITE-SPACE:NOWRAP">

	In the event that the SEC
	restarts the administrative proceedings, depending upon the final outcome, companies listed in the United States with major operations in the PRC may find it difficult or impossible to retain auditors in respect of their operations in the PRC, which
	could result in financial statements being determined to not be in compliance with the requirements of the Exchange Act, including possible delisting. Moreover, any negative news about any such future proceedings against these audit firms may cause

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	There have been regulations promulgated by various government authorities in China that govern the public access to corporate records and
	filings. Under the Measures for Accessing Corporate Records and Filings promulgated on December&nbsp;16, 1996 by the State Administration of Industry and Commerce (the &#147;SAIC&#148;), or the SAIC measures, corporate records such as registration
	records, registration documents submitted for approval, records relating to the change of the enterprise, records relating to the cancellation or revocation of the enterprise and records relating to the supervision and inspection of the enterprise
	can be inspected by the public through computers without restrictions, while a company&#146;s book records and filings can only be inspected by authorized government officials or lawyers involved in pending litigation relating to such company and
	with court-issued proof of such litigation. In practice, local industry and commerce administration authorities in different cities have adopted various regional regulations which impose more stringent restrictions than the SAIC measures by
	restricting the scope of information that the public can freely access. Many local industry and commerce administration authorities only allow unrestricted public access to such basic corporate information as name, legal representative, registered
	capital and business scope of a company. Under these local regulations, access to the other corporate records and filings (many of which are not subject to restriction on access under the SAIC measures) is only granted to authorized government
	officials or lawyers involved in pending litigation relating to such company and with court-issued proof of such litigation.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	However,
	neither the SAIC nor the local industry and commerce administration authorities were reported to have strictly implemented the restrictions under either the SAIC measures or the various regional regulations before early 2012. As a result, before
	early 2012, the public, including public shareholders of China-based, U.S.-listed companies and other market participants, such as lawyers and research firms, were reported to be able to access all or most corporate records and filings of these
	listed companies&#146; PRC entities maintained with the industry and commerce administration authorities. Such records and filings were reported to have formed important components of researches on certain China-based, U.S.-listed companies, which
	researches claimed to have uncovered wrongdoings and fraud committed by these companies on the basis of (i)&nbsp;the disparities found between the listed companies&#146; reported results and their PRC entities&#146; financial reports filed with
	industry and commerce administration authorities, and (ii)&nbsp;information on material changes of the PRC entities, such as transfers of equity interests of significant PRC subsidiaries, that were filed with the industry and commerce administration
	authorities but not properly disclosed by such listed companies as required under the U.S. securities law and the SEC&#146;s disclosure requirements. The significant disparities found between (i)&nbsp;certain China-based, U.S.-listed companies&#146;
	reported results and other disclosure and (ii)&nbsp;their PRC entities&#146; financial reports and other records filed with industry and commerce administration authorities were also reported to have formed the basis of several class actions against
	such listed companies in the U.S.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	It was reported that, since the first half of 2012, local industry and commerce administration
	authorities in a number of cities had started strictly implementing the above restrictions and had significantly curtailed public access to corporate records and filings. There have also been reports that only the limited scope of basic corporate
	records and filings are still accessible by the public, and much of the previously publicly accessible information, such as financial reports and changes to equity interests, now can only be accessed by the parties specified in, and in strict
	accordance with the restrictions under, the various regional regulations. Such reported limitation on the public access to corporate records and filings and the resulting concerns over the loss of, or limit in, an otherwise available source of
	information to verify and evaluate the soundness of China-based U.S.-listed companies&#146; business operations in China may have a significant adverse effect on the overall investor confidence in China-based, U.S.-listed companies&#146; reported

	The trading prices of our ADSs are likely to be
	volatile and could fluctuate widely in response to factors beyond our control. For example, if one or more of the industry analysts or ratings agencies who cover us downgrades us or our ADSs, or publishes unfavorable research about us, the price of
	our ADSs may decline. If one or more of these analysts or agencies cease to cover our company or fail to regularly publish reports on us, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which could cause the price of our ADSs or trading volume to
	decline. In addition, the performance and fluctuation of the market prices of other China-based,
<FONT STYLE="WHITE-SPACE:NOWRAP">
	US-listed
</FONT>
	companies, including those of education companies, and those of companies planning to delist from U.S.
	stock exchanges and then publicly list on China&#146;s stock market, may affect the volatility in the price of and trading volumes for our ADSs. In the past, a number of PRC companies have listed their securities, or are in the process of preparing
	for listing their securities, on U.S. stock markets. Some of these companies have experienced significant volatility, including significant price declines following their initial public offerings. The trading performances of these PRC
	companies&#146; securities at the time of or after their offerings may affect the overall investor sentiment towards PRC companies listed in the United States and consequently may impact the trading performance of our ADSs. These broad market and
	industry factors may significantly affect the market price and volatility of our ADSs, regardless of our actual operating performance.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	In
	addition to market and industry factors, the price and trading volume for our ADSs may be highly volatile for specific business reasons. Factors such as variations in our revenues due to different reasons, earnings and cash flow, announcements of
	new investments, cooperation arrangements, acquisitions, cessation or reorganization of business lines, legal dispute, declaration of dividends, fluctuations in market prices for our services, listing of individual business lines on the New Third
	Board, and other financing activities could cause the market price for our ADSs to change substantially. Any of these factors may result in large and sudden changes in the volume and price at which our ADSs will trade. We cannot give any assurance
	that these factors will not occur in the future again. In the past, following periods of volatility in the market price of a company&#146;s securities, shareholders have often instituted securities class action litigation against that company. If we
	were involved in a class action lawsuit, it could divert the attention of senior management, and, if adversely determined, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

	The effect of this discretionary proxy is that, absent the situations described above, you cannot

	Depending upon the value of our ADSs or ordinary shares and the nature and composition of our assets and
	income over time, we could be classified as a passive foreign investment company, or PFIC, for U.S. federal income tax purposes for any taxable year. We will be classified as a PFIC in any taxable year if either (a)&nbsp;the average quarterly value
	of our gross assets that produce passive income or are held for the production of passive income is at least 50% of the average quarterly value of our total gross assets (the &#147;asset test&#148;) or (b)&nbsp;75% or more of our gross income for
	the taxable year is passive income.

	Based on the composition of our assets and income during the taxable year ended September&nbsp;30,
	2016, we believe we were not a PFIC for that taxable year. However, there can be no assurance that we will not be a PFIC in any future taxable year, as PFIC status is tested each taxable year and will depend on the composition of our assets and
	income in such taxable year. In particular, in determining the average percentage value of our gross assets that are passive and
<FONT STYLE="WHITE-SPACE:NOWRAP">
	non-passive
</FONT>
	assets, respectively, the aggregate value of our assets should
	generally be deemed to be equal to our market capitalization (the sum of the aggregate value of our outstanding equity) plus our liabilities. Therefore, a drop in the market price of our ADSs and ordinary shares and associated decrease in the value
	of our goodwill would cause a reduction in the value of our
<FONT STYLE="WHITE-SPACE:NOWRAP">
	non-passive
</FONT>
	assets for purposes of the asset test. Accordingly, we would likely become a PFIC if our market capitalization were to decrease
	significantly while we hold substantial cash and cash equivalents. We currently hold, and expect to continue to hold, a substantial amount of cash and other passive assets, which could affect our PFIC status in future years.

	Our corporate affairs are governed by our second amended and restated memorandum of association and articles of association, the Cayman Islands
	Companies Law (as amended) and the common law of the Cayman Islands. The rights of shareholders to take action against the directors, actions by minority shareholders and the fiduciary responsibilities of our directors to us under Cayman Islands law
	are to a large extent governed by the common law of the Cayman Islands. The common law of the Cayman Islands is derived in part from comparatively limited judicial precedent in the Cayman Islands as well as from English common law, which has
	persuasive, but not binding, authority on a court in the Cayman Islands. The rights of our shareholders and the fiduciary responsibilities of our directors under Cayman Islands law are not as clearly established as they would be under statutes or
	judicial precedent in some jurisdictions in the United States. In particular, the Cayman Islands has a less developed body of securities law than the United States. In addition, some jurisdictions, such as Delaware, have more fully developed and
	judicially interpreted bodies of corporate law than the Cayman Islands. As a result of all of the above, public shareholders may have more difficulty in protecting their interests in the face of actions taken by management, members of the board of

	Our mission is to be a
	life-long, comprehensive online education partner for professionals and other learners in China. In particular, we focus on helping professionals seeking to obtain and maintain professional licenses and to enhance their job skills through our
	professional development courses. We believe that we are the largest provider of online education in China primarily focusing on professional education, as measured by total number of course enrollments in 2016. As of September&nbsp;30, 2016, our
	content library encompassed 263 course offerings, approximately 6,600 classes, and close to 30,000 hours of audio-video content across 13 subject areas.

	Our online courses typically feature

	pre-recorded,

	high-definition audio-video lectures taught by
	experts within their respective fields. Lectures can be viewed either through streaming via the Internet or can be downloaded to various devices, including computers, tablets and smart phones. To enhance the learning experience, our online lectures
	are supplemented by our proprietary Learning Management System which tracks students&#146; individual study progress, enables students to record course notes, and enables students to collect incorrectly answered questions for future review and
	provides other content, such as course outlines, exercise questions, mock exams, and Frequently Asked Questions and Answers. In addition, we provide comprehensive course-related support services that include online tutoring and 24/7 customer service
	via our call center.

	Our websites also generate significant user traffic. As of September&nbsp;30, 2016, we had 43.7&nbsp;million
	cumulative registered users, and we believe our websites were among the most visited websites in China&#146;s education industry, as measured by 94&nbsp;million total average daily unique visitors and 50.7&nbsp;million average daily page views for
	our fiscal year ended September&nbsp;30, 2016. As of September&nbsp;30, 2016, we offered 67 downloadable and proprietary mobile applications and have had over 17&nbsp;million downloads as of that date. We have a track record of successfully

	test preparation courses for university students intending to take the nationwide graduate school entrance exam, and online language courses. We also offer third-party developed online courses through our Online Open Learning Platform, a proprietary
	education platform that allows people to share their educational content or deliver live courses online. In May 2015, we launched our College Cooperation Program which enables us to expand our industry-leading online accounting educational content
	and services to college and university students, in partnership with colleges and universities. Our acquisition of Xiamen NetinNet in May 2016 further complements our suite of learning solutions for the growing College Cooperation Program, and

	We offer different types of classes for various subjects within each course and multiple courses for each
	discipline. Each course typically represents one examination, professional development or continuing education requirement. To access our classes, course participants must first log into their online registered accounts and enroll in our courses.
	They are typically able to choose among several different lecturers within each class. After selecting a lecturer, course participants can view the video along with the lecture script and click on hyperlinks for other useful functions during the
	lecture. For example, course participants can receive tutoring support by posting a question on the question and answer board; pause the video to take notes, practice mock exam questions, or evaluate lecturers&#146; performance; and access the
	bulletin board or other helpful information. These functions are part of our proprietary Learning Management System, which monitors our course participants&#146; individual progress, records course notes, and collects incorrectly answered questions

	Prior to August 2014, only registered tax agents were able to carry out tax agency services, issue tax audit reports and handle tax procedures such as applications for tax
	registration with relevant authorities on behalf of business entities. Persons wishing to qualify as registered tax agents were required to pass the RTA Qualification Exam. In August 2014, the PRC State Council cancelled the RTA Qualification Exam.

	obligated to conduct online lectures exclusively for us. They are not our employees, however, and typically work for us on a part-time basis. A small portion of our lecturers are our tutors who remain full-time employees after becoming our
	lecturers. We have received positive feedback on these
<FONT STYLE="WHITE-SPACE:NOWRAP">

	lecturers from course participants and plan to continue to increase their numbers across all our course offerings in the future. The number of

	To ensure the quality of our lecturers, we have established stringent selection and retention criteria and implemented ongoing evaluation
	procedures. We seek to engage lecturers who have a strong command of their respective disciplines and good communication skills. In particular, we seek lecturers capable of, and preferably experienced in, delivering effective instruction through the
	audio-video format. Our internal quality control personnel regularly monitor the teaching quality of each lecturer. We also collect feedback on the online lecturers from our course participants on a regular basis through multiple channels, including
	our online teacher evaluation system, customer service calls, our online course comment book, and our online question and answer board. Based on this feedback, we provide ongoing training for lecturers and help them improve their online presentation

	telecommunications business operating licenses to any foreign investor in any form, or providing any resources, sites or facilities to any foreign investor for their illegal operation of a telecommunications business in China. According to the MIIT

	The principal regulations governing private education in China consist of the Education Law of the PRC, the Law for Promoting Private Education
	(2003)&nbsp;and the Implementation Rules for the Law for Promoting Private Education (2004). These regulations are summarized below.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	On
	March&nbsp;18, 1995, the National People&#146;s Congress promulgated the Education Law of the PRC, or the Education Law, which became effective on September&nbsp;1, 1995. The Education Law stipulates that enterprises, social organizations and
	individuals are encouraged to operate schools and other types of educational organizations in accordance with the PRC laws and regulations. Meanwhile, no organization or individual may establish or operate a school or any other institutions of
	education for profit-making purposes. However, private schools may be operated for &#147;reasonable returns&#148; as described in more detail below. On December&nbsp;27, 2015, the National People&#146;s Congress amended the Education Law of the PRC,
	which became effective on June&nbsp;1, 2016. The amended Education Law of the PRC, among other things, deleted the restrictions on organizations or individuals establishing or operating schools or any other institutions of education for
	profit-making purposes, and added a requirement that the schools and other institutions of education which are established with governmental funds or donated assets may not establish profit-making institutions of education.

	The Law for Promoting Private Education (2003)&nbsp;became effective on September&nbsp;1, 2003
	and was amended on June&nbsp;29, 2013, and the Implementation Rules for the Law for Promoting Private Education (2004)&nbsp;became effective on April&nbsp;1, 2004. Under these regulations, &#147;private schools&#148; are defined as schools
	established by social organizations or individuals using
<FONT STYLE="WHITE-SPACE:NOWRAP">
	non-government
</FONT>
	funds. In addition, private schools providing certifications,
<FONT STYLE="WHITE-SPACE:NOWRAP">
	pre-school
</FONT>
	education, education for
	self-study aid and other academic education shall be subject to approval by the education authorities, while private schools engaging in occupational qualification training and occupational skill training shall be subject to approvals from the
	authorities in charge of labor and social welfare. A duly approved private school will be granted a Permit for Operating a Private School, and shall be registered with the Ministry of Civil Affairs of the PRC, or MCA or its local counterparts as a
<FONT STYLE="WHITE-SPACE:NOWRAP">
	privately-run,
</FONT>
<FONT STYLE="WHITE-SPACE:NOWRAP">

	institution. On November&nbsp;7, 2016, the SCNPC passed the amendment to the Law for Promoting Private Education, which will be effective on
	September&nbsp;1, 2017 pursuant to which
<FONT STYLE="WHITE-SPACE:NOWRAP">
	for-profit
</FONT>
	private schools are allowed to be established, except schools for compulsory education. Each of Beijing Champion Training School and Nanjing Champion
	Training School holds a Permit for Operating a Private School, which is valid through June&nbsp;1, 2020 and October&nbsp;31, 2017, respectively.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Under the above regulations, private schools have the same status as public schools, though private schools are prohibited from providing
	military, police, political and other kinds of education which are of a special nature. In addition, the operation of private schools is highly regulated. For example, the types and amounts of fees charged by private schools offering certifications
	must be approved by the relevant governmental authority and be publicly disclosed, and the types and amounts of fees charged by private schools that do not offer certifications need only be filed with the relevant governmental authority and be
	publicly disclosed.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Private education is treated as a public welfare undertaking under the regulations. Nonetheless, investors in a
	private school may choose to require &#147;reasonable returns&#148; from the annual net balance of the school after deduction of costs, donations received, government subsidies, if any, the reserved development fund and other expenses as required by
	the regulations.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The election to establish a private school requiring reasonable returns shall be provided in the articles of association
	of the school. The percentage of the school&#146;s annual net balance that can be distributed as reasonable returns shall be determined by the school&#146;s board of directors, taking into consideration the following factors: (i)&nbsp;the
	school&#146;s tuition and other fees, (ii)&nbsp;the ratio of the school&#146;s expenses used for educational activities and improving the educational conditions to the total fees collected; and (iii)&nbsp;the school&#146;s admission standards and
	educational quality. Information relating to the above factors shall be publicly disclosed before the school&#146;s board determines the percentage of the school&#146;s annual net balance that can be distributed as reasonable returns. This disclosed
	information and the decision to distribute reasonable returns shall also be filed with the approval authorities within 15 days from the decision made by the board. However, none of the current PRC laws and regulations provides a formula or
	guidelines for determining &#147;reasonable returns.&#148; In addition, none of the current PRC laws and regulations sets forth different requirements or restrictions on a private school&#146;s ability to operate its education business based on such
	school&#146;s status as a school that requires reasonable returns or a school that does not require reasonable returns. On July&nbsp;29, 2010, the PRC central government, in the Outlines of China&#146;s National Plan for Medium and Long Term
	Education Reform and Development promulgated by it, for the first time announced the policy that the government will implement a reform to divide private education entities into two categories:
<FONT STYLE="WHITE-SPACE:NOWRAP">
	(i)&nbsp;for-profit

	private education entities and
<FONT STYLE="WHITE-SPACE:NOWRAP">
<FONT STYLE="WHITE-SPACE:NOWRAP">

	private education entities.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	At the end of each fiscal year, private schools are required to allocate a certain amount to their development fund for the construction and
	maintenance of the school and the procurement and upgrade of educational equipment. In the case of private schools that require reasonable returns, this amount shall be no less than 25% of the annual net income or the annual increase in the net
	assets of the school, while in the case of private schools that do not require reasonable returns, this amount shall be no less than 25% of the annual increase in the net assets of the school, if any. Private schools that do not require reasonable
	returns shall be entitled to the same preferential tax treatment as public schools. The regulations require that preferential tax treatment policies applicable to private schools requiring reasonable returns to be formulated by the finance
	authority, taxation authority and other authorities under the State Council, but to date no such regulations have been promulgated by the relevant authorities.

	2007, amended on December&nbsp;28, 2012 and became effective on July&nbsp;1, 2013, employers must execute written labor contracts with full-time employees in order to establish an employment relationship. According to the Labor Contract Law, an
	employer is under an obligation to sign an unlimited-term labor contract with any employee who has worked for the employer for ten consecutive years. Further, if an employee requests or agrees to renew a fixed-term labor contract that has already
	been entered into twice consecutively, the resulting contract must have an unlimited term, with certain exceptions. The employer must also pay severance to an employee in nearly all instances where a labor contract, including a contract with an

	times his daily salary, subject to certain exceptions. In addition, companies operating in China are required to participate in social insurance and housing fund plans in which the employers must pay for the employees social welfare and housing fund

	Under current PRC regulations, foreign-invested enterprises such as our PRC subsidiaries are
	required to apply to SAFE or its designated banks for foreign exchange registration. With such a registration, a foreign-invested enterprise may open foreign exchange bank accounts at banks authorized to conduct foreign exchange business by SAFE and
	may buy, sell and remit foreign exchange through such banks, subject to documentation and approval requirements. Foreign-invested enterprises are required to open and maintain separate foreign exchange accounts for capital account transactions and
	current account transactions. In addition, there are restrictions on the amount of foreign currency that foreign-invested enterprises may retain in such accounts.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Further, SAFE promulgated a new circular (known as Circular 142) in August 2008 with respect to the administration of conversion of foreign
	exchange capital contributions of a foreign invested enterprise. The circular clarifies that Renminbi converted from foreign exchange capital contributions can only be used for the activities within the approved business scope of such foreign
	invested enterprise and cannot be used for domestic equity investments unless otherwise permitted.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	In addition, SAFE also strengthened
	its oversight over the flow and use of Renminbi converted from the foreign currency denominated capital of a foreign-invested company. The use of such Renminbi may not be changed without approval from SAFE, and such Renminbi may not be used to repay
	Renminbi loans if the proceeds of such loans have not yet been used. Violations of Circular 142 may result in severe penalties, including substantial fines as set forth in the related foreign exchange administration rules. In addition, SAFE
	promulgated a circular on November&nbsp;9, 2010, or Circular 59, which tightens the regulation over settlement of the fund which is raised from overseas offerings such as our initial public offering and
<FONT STYLE="WHITE-SPACE:NOWRAP">

	public offering. Furthermore, it has recently come to our attention that SAFE issued an internal guideline to its local counterparts, referred to as Circular 45, in November 2011. Circular 45 has never
	been formally announced by SAFE to the public or posted on SAFE&#146;s website. Based on the version made publicly available by certain local governmental authorities on their websites, we understand that Circular 45 requires SAFE&#146;s local
	counterparts to strengthen the control imposed by Circulars 142 and 59 over the conversion of a foreign-invested company&#146;s capital contributed in foreign currency into RMB. Circular 45 stipulates that a foreign-invested company&#146;s RMB
	funds, if converted from such company&#146;s capital contributed in foreign currency, may not be used by such company to (i)&nbsp;extend loans (in the form of entrusted loans), (ii)&nbsp;repay borrowings between enterprises, or (iii)&nbsp;repay bank

	of the foreign exchange capital in the capital account of foreign-invested enterprises can be settled at the banks based on the actual operation needs of the foreign-invested enterprises. The capital in Renminbi obtained by foreign-invested

	According to our PRC counsel, as our contractual arrangements were first established in 2003, the
	new security review system shall not apply to our contractual arrangements. We cannot guarantee, however, that the Ministry of Commerce will not promulgate additional implementing rules or new rules that will bring our contractual arrangements under
	the scope of the security review system. Moreover, according to a press conference held by the Ministry of Commerce on September&nbsp;20, 2011, there are no specific laws or regulations governing contractual arrangements like the ones that we
	employ, but the Ministry of Commerce together with other authorities would study how to regulate them in the future. Hence, we cannot assure you that our contractual arrangements will not be subject to new regulations that will be issued by relevant
	regulatory authorities and that such new regulations will not cause any material adverse effect on our existing structure. See &#147;Item 3.D. Key Information &#151; Risk Factors &#151; Risks Relating to Our Corporate Structure and Restrictions on

	On February&nbsp;15, 2012, SAFE issued the Notice on Issues concerning the Foreign Exchange Administration for Domestic Individuals
	Participating in Stock Incentive Plan of Overseas Publicly-Listed Company, or the Stock Option Rules. According to the Stock Option Rules, PRC residents who participate in an employee share incentive plan of an overseas publicly-listed company are
	required to register with the SAFE and complete certain other procedures. These participates should retain a PRC agent, which can be a branch or representative office of the overseas listed company in China, a Chinese institution which has
	controlling relationship or actual control relationship with the offshore listed company, or a Chinese institution qualified for asset custody business, to handle various foreign exchange matters associated with their employee share incentive plan.
	The PRC agent should file on behalf of the PRC resident an application with SAFE to register such employee share incentive plan, apply annually for a quota for the payment of foreign currencies in connection with the exercise of the employee share
	options by the PRC resident and open a special foreign exchange account at a PRC domestic bank to hold the funds required in connection with the share incentive plan. In addition, the PRC agent is required to amend the SAFE registration with respect
	to the stock incentive plan if there is any material change to the employee share incentive plan, PRC agent or overseas entrusted institution.

	In addition, the State Administration of Taxation has issued a few circulars concerning employee share options. Under these circulars, our
	employees working in China who exercise share options will be subject to PRC individual income tax. Our PRC subsidiaries have obligations to file documents relating to employee share options with relevant tax authorities and withhold individual
	income taxes of those employees who exercise their share options. If our employees fail to pay and we fail to withhold their income taxes, we may face sanctions imposed by tax authorities or other PRC government authorities.

	On
	March&nbsp;16, 2007, the National People&#146;s Congress, the Chinese legislature, passed the EIT Law, which took effect on January&nbsp;1, 2008. The EIT Law applies a uniform 25% enterprise income tax rate to both foreign-invested enterprises and
	domestic enterprises. There is a transition period for the enterprises, whether foreign-invested or domestic, which had received preferential tax treatments granted by relevant tax authorities prior to March&nbsp;16, 2007. Enterprises that had been
	subject to an enterprise income tax rate lower than 25% prior to March&nbsp;16, 2007 may continue to enjoy the lower rate and gradually transfer to the new tax rate within five years after the effective date of the EIT Law. Enterprises that had been
	entitled to exemptions or reductions from the standard income tax rate for a fixed term prior to March&nbsp;16, 2007 may continue to enjoy such treatment until the fixed term expires. Preferential tax treatments will continue to be granted to
	industries and projects that are strongly supported and encouraged by the state, and enterprises otherwise classified as &#147;high and new technology enterprises strongly supported by the state&#148; upon
<FONT STYLE="WHITE-SPACE:NOWRAP">

	will be entitled to a 15% enterprise income tax rate. The EIT Law empowers the State Council to enact appropriate implementing rules and regulations. The State Council promulgated the
	implementation rules of the EIT Law in December 2007 and the Ministry of Science and Technology, the MOF and the SAT promulgated other supplemental rules in April 2008 and July 2008 which were canceled and replaced by new rules in January 2016 and
	June 2016, respectively, regarding new criteria for the granting of &#147;high and new technology enterprises&#148; status. Any enterprises to be granted with &#147;high and new technology enterprises&#148; status shall meet certain requirements,
	including but not limited to the following: (1)&nbsp;the enterprise has been incorporated for more than one year before application; (2)&nbsp;the enterprise itself owns the intellectual property right for the core technology of its product or
	service; (3)&nbsp;the enterprise&#146;s core technology of its product or service falls into the ambit of &#147;high-tech fields heavily supported by the government&#148;; (4) technicians that are engaged into research and development account for
	more than 10% of all the staff; (5)&nbsp;in the latest three financial years (actual operating year if incorporated less than three years), the research and development expenses account for
<FONT STYLE="WHITE-SPACE:NOWRAP">
	3%-5%
</FONT>
	or more of
	the latest sales revenue and the research and development expenses incurred within China shall not be less than 60% of the total research and development expenses; (6)&nbsp;the revenue in the latest year derived from the high-tech product or service
	accounts for more 60% of the total revenue; (7)&nbsp;the innovation capability of the enterprise shall meet the relevant evaluation standards; and (8)&nbsp;no major security or qualification incident or sever environmental illegal behavior occurred
	within the previous year before application. To apply for the &#147;high and new technology enterprises&#148; status, an enterprise shall file its corporate certificates and supporting documents evidencing the requirements to the relevant government
	authority. The government authority will examine the filed certificates and documents to determine whether the enterprise meets the &#147;high and new technology enterprises&#148; requirements. If the decision is positive, the authority will make a
	public announcement and grant the enterprise with a &#147;high and new technology enterprises&#148; certificate with a valid term of three years. Upon the expiration of the initial term, the enterprise shall file a new application to obtain such
	status. Loss of any preferential tax treatments previously granted to us could have a material and adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.

	We believe that we are the largest provider of online education in China primarily focusing on professional education, as measured by total
	number of course enrollments in 2016. For the fiscal year ended September&nbsp;30, 2016, we had course enrollments of 3.7&nbsp;million. As of September&nbsp;30, 2016, our content library encompassed 263 course offerings, approximately 6,600 classes,
	and close to 30,000 hours of audio-video content across 13 subject areas. We believe our course participants are attracted to our high-quality, results-oriented courses, our students&#146; superior learning experience empowered and supported by our

	We focus our online professional education services in three main industries: accounting, healthcare and
	engineering&nbsp;&amp; construction. In addition, we also offer other professional education courses, such as test-preparation courses for the national judicial examination, online test-preparation courses for self-taught learners pursuing higher
	education diplomas or degrees, test preparation courses for university students intending to take the nationwide graduate school entrance exam, and online language courses. We also offer third-party developed online courses through our Online Open
	Learning Platform, a proprietary education platform that allows people to share their educational content and deliver live courses online. In May 2015 we launched our College Cooperation Program which enables us to expand our industry-leading online
	accounting educational content and services to college and university students, in partnership with colleges and universities. Our acquisition of Xiamen NetinNet in May 2016 further complements our suite of learning solutions for the growing College
	Cooperation Program, and enables us to offer comprehensive simulation-based learning content to college students to master critical accounting skills. As of September&nbsp;30, 2016, we operated 25 websites, including our main website
<I>
	www.cdeledu.com
</I>
	and 24 other websites, each dedicated to a specific industry, profession or discipline. Our online education courses accounted for 82.9%, 82.0% and 79.9% of our net revenues in the fiscal years ended September&nbsp;30, 2014, 2015
	and 2016, respectively. In addition to traditional online courses, we also offer certain

	Number of enrollments in our courses
</I>
	. Our ability to generate and grow our net revenues is primarily affected by our ability to increase the number of course enrollments. This in turn is driven by several
	factors, including government and industry requirements for education and training in various professions, changes in exam schedules, recognition of our brand and services, Internet and broadband penetration rate, and the perceived effectiveness of
	our education courses. Government regulations requiring increased number of licensure and certification exams provide us with new market opportunities to develop new courses and to attract potential exam participants as our customers. Changes in
	exam content and knowledge requirements in certain industries and professions, and the increased difficulty, or perceived difficulty of certain exams covered by our courses, may also contribute to growth in our course enrollments as more exam takers
	may feel a stronger need to take exam preparation courses. Government policies encouraging business

	training provide us with new market opportunities to develop new courses and to attract potential
	course participants to take our courses. We may also, from time to time, experience a decrease in course enrollments in certain course offerings if there is a perception within the related industries or professions that certain exams have become
	less difficult, or the content more routine and familiar, and as a result these exam takers may be less inclined to spend additional money on test preparation courses. Finally, any government decisions to scale back, postpone or cancel certain
	exams, combine exams or adopt measures that might reduce the number of exam participants may adversely impact our revenues. For example, the PRC State Council promulgated a decision in August 2014, pursuant to which various professional
	qualifications or certificates, including the Registered Tax Agent and Certified Asset Appraiser, were cancelled or replaced with a qualification evaluation system administered by the State Council. In addition, the government authorities have
	tightened the employment policy of Associate Constructor and Constructor in 2015. The number of our course enrollments and, therefore, revenues generated from our course offerings for these professional qualifications or certificates for the fiscal
	year ended September&nbsp;30, 2015 were adversely affected. The revenue generated from the RTA Qualification Exam, and Associate Constructor and Constructor Qualification Exams decreased by 81.9% and 7.1%, respectively, in fiscal year 2015, compared
	to fiscal year 2014. The revenue generated from the Associate Constructor and Constructor Qualification Exams further decreased by 14.1% in fiscal year 2016, compared to fiscal year 2015. We expect the employment policy of Associate Constructor and
	Constructor will continue to adversely impact our enrollments and, therefore, revenues in the near future. Starting from late November of 2016, the Department of Finance in certain provinces and cities has suspended the Accounting Certificate
	Examination due to the proposed change in the related examination policy. Such suspension may impact our revenue in fiscal year 2017.

	portion of our cost of services and others because we allocate significant resources to hire high-quality lecturers. The number of lecturers actively producing online courses for us was 341, 365 and 452 in the fiscal years ended September&nbsp;30,
	2014, 2015 and 2016, respectively. Our online platform enables us to achieve greater economies of scale than traditional offline programs that are limited by fixed teacher-student ratios as we are able to increase the number of course participants
	without necessarily increasing the number of our lecturers. Our fees paid to online lecturers as a percentage of our net revenues from online education services decreased in the fiscal year ended September&nbsp;30, 2016, as compared to the fiscal
	year ended September&nbsp;30, 2015. Our fees paid to online lecturers as a percentage of our net revenues from online education services increased in the fiscal year ended September&nbsp;30, 2015, as compared to the fiscal year ended
	September&nbsp;30, 2014, mainly due to weakening revenue growth in our online education services. See &#147;Item 5.A. Operating and Financial Review and Prospects &#150; Operating Results &#150; Specific Factors Affecting Our Results of
	Operations&#148; for the impact of cancellation of Registered Tax Agent qualification and tightening the employment policy of Associate Constructor and Constructor on our revenues. Our fees paid to offline lecturers remained flat in the fiscal year
	ended September&nbsp;30, 2016, primarily due to stricter control on the lecturer fees per class. As a result, our fees paid to lecturers as a percentage of our net revenues decreased in the fiscal year ended September&nbsp;30, 2016, as compared to
	the fiscal year ended September&nbsp;30, 2015.

	Under the EIT Law, an
	enterprise established outside of the PRC with &#147;de facto management bodies&#148; within the PRC is considered a PRC resident enterprise and will be subject to the enterprise income tax at the rate of 25% on its global income. The implementation
	rules define the term &#147;de facto management bodies&#148; as establishments that carry out substantial and overall management and control over the manufacturing and business operations, personnel, accounting, properties, etc. of an enterprise.
	The SAT issued the Notice Regarding the Determination of Chinese-Controlled Offshore Incorporated Enterprises as PRC Tax Resident Enterprises on the Basis of De Facto Management Bodies, or Circular 82, on April&nbsp;22, 2009. Circular 82 provides
	certain specific criteria for determining whether the &#147;de facto management body&#148; of a Chinese-controlled offshore-incorporated enterprise is located in China. In addition, the SAT issued a bulletin on July&nbsp;27, 2011, effective
	September&nbsp;1, 2011, providing more guidance on the implementation of Circular 82. This bulletin clarifies matters including residence status determination, post-determination administration and competent tax authorities. Although both Circular
	82 and the bulletin only apply to offshore enterprises controlled by PRC enterprises or PRC enterprise groups and not those controlled by PRC individuals or foreign corporations, the determination criteria set forth in Circular 82 and the bulletin
	may reflect the SAT&#146;s general position on how the &#147;de facto management body&#148; test should be applied in determining the tax residency status of offshore enterprises and how the administration measures should be implemented with respect
	to such enterprises, regardless of whether they are controlled by PRC enterprises or PRC individuals. Although we do not believe that our legal entities organized outside of the PRC constitute PRC resident enterprises, it is possible that the PRC
	tax authorities could reach a different conclusion. See &#147;Risk Factors&nbsp;&#151;&nbsp;Risks Relating to Doing Business in China&nbsp;&#151;&nbsp;Under the China&#146;s enterprise income tax law, we may be classified as a PRC &#145;resident
	enterprise&#146;, which could result in unfavorable tax consequences to us and our shareholders and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and the value of your investment.&#148;

	authority. Entities that are VAT general taxpayers are allowed to offset qualified input VAT paid to suppliers against their output VAT liabilities. Net VAT balance between input VAT and output VAT is recorded in the line item of accrued expenses

	In addition, in accordance with the relevant tax laws in the PRC, VAT
	is also calculated based on the sales value of books and reference materials and is payable by the purchaser. Revenues are recognized net of all VAT imposed by governmental authorities and collected from customers concurrent with revenue generating
	transactions. Pursuant to a circular jointly issued by MOF and SAT on December&nbsp;25, 2013, the proceeds received from customers for sales related to books and reference materials are exempt from VAT from January&nbsp;1, 2013 through
	December&nbsp;31, 2017. As a result, Beijing Champion and Zhengbao Yucai started to enjoy this tax exemption from March 2014 and May 2014 respectively upon the filing of tax exemption applications to the state tax bureau. Such VAT exemption is also
	applicable to Champion Culture from January 2016. VAT related to sales of our books and reference materials amounted to approximately $0.5&nbsp;million, $nil and $nil for the fiscal years ended September&nbsp;30, 2014, 2015 and 2016, respectively.

	prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP, which requires us to make judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of our assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and
	liabilities on the date of each set of consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during each financial reporting period. We continually evaluate these estimates and assumptions based on the most recently

	An accounting policy is considered to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be
	made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time such estimate is made, and if different accounting estimates that reasonably could have been used, or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely to
	occur periodically, could materially impact the consolidated financial statements. Some of our accounting policies require higher degrees of judgment than others in their application. We consider the policies discussed below to be critical to an

<FONT STYLE="WHITE-SPACE:NOWRAP">

	conditions are met, the participant can retake the same premium course for free for the following year (for free or by paying us discounted course fees for the following year or years in fiscal year 2014 and 2015). As such, the discount is

	We offer volume discounts to our regional distributors for purchases over a specified amount of prepaid cards during a specified period of
	time, generally one year. The after-discount prices of the study cards paid by the regional distributors to us are recognized as deferred revenue. Because we cannot reasonably estimate the amount of future rebates relating to these volume discounts,
	we record a deferred revenue balance for the maximum potential amount of the volume discount. If the number of purchases specified in the volume discount provisions is not reached upon the expiration of the volume discount period, we then either
	recognize the deferred revenue relating to such volume discount for each study card over the remaining period that the online course is available to users who enroll using the study card or immediately if the related online course has been
	completed. Additionally, we recognize proceeds allocated to the study cards that have never been activated for course enrollment as revenues upon their expiration. We also provide course enrollment services and our online platform to government
	agencies that conduct continuing education services through our websites. We earn service fees as a percentage of total tuition fees based on the agreements entered into with the government agencies. Service fees received are initially recorded as
	deferred revenue and are recognized as revenue when course participants complete the stipulated study hours and take their examinations, or on a straight line basis over the subscription period based on terms of the agreements.

	In determining the fair values of our reporting units as of September&nbsp;30, 2016, we
	considered the discounted cash flow method, or DCF, of the income approach to be more reliable than other approaches. The discounted cash flow for each reporting unit was projected based on financial forecast developed by management for planning
	purposes. Cash flows beyond the forecast periods were estimated using a terminal value calculation, which incorporated historical and forecasted financial trends for each reporting unit. Specifically, the income approach valuation included a cash
	flow discount rate at 16%&#150;&nbsp;25% and a terminal value growth rate at 3%. Publicly available information regarding our market capitalization was also considered in assessing the reasonableness of the aggregate fair value of all the reporting
	units estimated using the income approach valuation methodology. Based on the result of goodwill impairment test as of September&nbsp;30, 2016, no impairment of goodwill was identified for the reporting units of online education service, business

	We follow the liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on
	the difference between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates that will be in effect in the period in which the differences are expected to reverse. The tax base of an asset or liability is the amount
	attributed to that asset or liability for tax purposes. The effect on deferred taxes of a change in tax rates is recognized in our income statement in the period that includes the enactment date. We consider current tax laws and our interpretation
	of them when we make our judgments, assumptions and estimates relative to current provision for income tax. We also assess a valuation allowance to offset deferred tax assets if based on the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not
	that some portion, or all, of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Such evidence includes our estimates of future taxable income and tax planning strategies. Changes in relevant tax laws, and our judgments, assumptions and estimates
	relative to current provision for income tax could have resulted in material differences in the amount of income taxes provided in our consolidated financial statements.

	For uncertainty in tax positions, we recognize the impact of a tax position in the financial

	Uncertainties exist with respect to how PRC&#146;s EIT Law applies to our overall operations, and more specifically, with
	regard to our tax residency status. The EIT Law includes a provision specifying that legal entities organized outside of the PRC will be considered residents for PRC enterprise income tax purposes if their place of effective management or control is
	within the PRC. The implementation rules to the EIT Law provide that
<FONT STYLE="WHITE-SPACE:NOWRAP">

	increased by 5.9% to $93.9&nbsp;million in the fiscal year ended September&nbsp;30, 2016 from $88.7&nbsp;million in the fiscal year ended September&nbsp;30, 2015. This increase was primarily due to overall modest growth in the total number of our

	enrollments from National Pharmacist Qualification Examination courses mainly due to later release of the related 2016 exam policy. As a result, we generated higher revenue in our accounting, healthcare, and open learning platform courses, offset by
	decreased revenue in engineering&nbsp;&amp; construction courses. Our accounting courses continued to account for the majority of our course enrollments and revenue. Our accounting courses generated revenues of approximately $52.5&nbsp;million in
	the fiscal year ended September&nbsp;30, 2016, compared to approximately $48.2&nbsp;million in the fiscal year ended September&nbsp;30, 2015. In addition, our healthcare and engineering&nbsp;&amp; construction courses generated revenues of

	of changes in business conditions or other future developments. Factors affecting our sources of liquidity include, for example, our sales performance, ability to control costs and expenses, choice of financing arrangements and mergers and
	acquisitions. Any changes in the significant factors affecting our revenues from education services may cause material fluctuations in our cash generated from operations. See &#147;Operating Results &#151; Overview &#151; Specific Factors Affecting
	Our Results of Operations&#148; for a description of these significant factors. Changes in working capital, including any significant shortening or lengthening of our accounts receivable cycle or customer prepayment cycles, may also cause
	fluctuations in our cash generated from operations. If our sources of liquidity are insufficient to satisfy our cash requirements, we may seek to sell additional equity or debt securities to meet our cash needs. The sale of convertible debt
	securities or additional equity securities could result in dilution to our shareholders. In addition, convertible debt securities would incur significant interest expense. The incurrence of indebtedness would result in debt service obligations and
	could result in operating and financial covenants that restrict our operations. We cannot assure you that future financing will be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us, if at all.

	Current PRC regulations permit our PRC subsidiaries to pay dividends to us only out of their accumulated profits, if any, determined in

<FONT STYLE="WHITE-SPACE:NOWRAP">

	profits, if any, to certain
	statutory reserves and funds prior to declaring and remitting dividends. For example, our PRC subsidiaries are required to allocate at least 10% of their

</FONT>
	profits to statutory reserves each year until
	such reserves reach 50% of their respective registered capital. Allocations to these statutory reserves and funds can be used only for specific purposes and are not transferable to us in the form of loans, advances or cash dividends. As a result,
	our PRC subsidiaries are restricted in their ability to transfer a portion of their net assets to us. Such limitations on the ability of our PRC subsidiaries to transfer funds to us could materially and adversely affect our ability to grow, make

	China Distance Education Holdings Limited was incorporated as an exempted company with limited liability in the Cayman Islands in January 2008
	under the Companies Law of the Cayman Islands, or the Company Law. Our corporate affairs are governed by our second amended and restated memorandum of association and articles of association, the Cayman Islands Companies Law and the common law of
	the Cayman Islands.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The Companies Law is modeled after similar laws in the United Kingdom but does not follow recent changes in United
	Kingdom laws. In addition, the Companies Law differs from laws applicable to United States corporations and their shareholders. Set forth below is a summary of the significant differences between the provisions of the Companies Law applicable to us
	and the laws applicable to companies incorporated in the United States.

<I>
	Mergers and Similar Arrangements
</I>
	. A merger of two or more
	constituent companies under Cayman Islands law requires a plan of merger or consolidation to be approved by the directors of each constituent company and authorization by (a)&nbsp;a special resolution of the shareholders and (b)&nbsp;such other
	authorization, if any, as may be specified in such constituent company&#146;s articles of association.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	A merger between a Cayman parent
	company and its Cayman subsidiary or subsidiaries does not require authorization by a resolution of shareholders of that Cayman subsidiary if a copy of the plan of merger is given to every member of that Cayman subsidiary to be merged unless that
	member agrees otherwise. For this purpose, a subsidiary is a company of which at least ninety percent (90%)&nbsp;of the issued shares entitled to vote are owned by the parent company.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The consent of each holder of a fixed or floating security interest over a constituent company is required unless this requirement is waived
	by a court in the Cayman Islands.

	Save in certain circumstances, a dissentient shareholder of a Cayman constituent company is entitled to
	payment of the fair value of his shares upon dissenting to a merger or consolidation. The exercise of appraisal rights will preclude the exercise of any other rights save for the right to seek relief on the grounds that the merger or consolidation
	is void or unlawful.

	In addition, there are statutory provisions that facilitate the reconstruction and amalgamation of companies,
	provided that the arrangement is approved by a majority in number of each class of shareholders and creditors with whom the arrangement is to be made, and who must, in addition, represent three-fourths in value of each such class of shareholders or
	creditors, as the case may be, that are present and voting either in person or by proxy at a meeting, or meetings, convened for that purpose. The convening of the meetings and subsequently the arrangement must be sanctioned by the Grand Court of the
	Cayman Islands. While a dissenting shareholder has the right to express to the court the view that the transaction ought not to be approved, the court can be expected to approve the arrangement if it determines that:

	We believe that we were not a PFIC for U.S. federal income tax purposes for our taxable year

	Substantially all of our revenues and expenditures are denominated in Renminbi. As a result, fluctuations in the exchange rate between the U.S.
	dollars and Renminbi will affect our financial results in U.S. dollars terms without giving effect to any underlying change in our business or results of operations. The Renminbi&#146;s exchange rate with the U.S. dollar and other currencies is
	affected by, among other things, changes in China&#146;s political and economic conditions and China&#146;s foreign exchange policies. The People&#146;s Bank of China regularly intervenes in the foreign exchange market to limit fluctuations in
	Renminbi exchange rate and achieve certain exchange rate targets, and through such intervention kept the U.S. dollar-Renminbi exchange rate relatively stable within a very narrow range against the U.S. dollar (remaining within 1% of its July 2008
	high) for almost two years from July 2008. On June&nbsp;20, 2010, the People&#146;s Bank of China announced that the PRC government would further reform the Renminbi exchange rate regime and increase the flexibility of the exchange rate. On
	March&nbsp;15, 2014, the People&#146;s Bank of China announced that it expanded the daily RMB against U.S. dollar trading band of the inter-bank spot foreign exchange market from 1% to 2% as of March&nbsp;17, 2014, to allow Renminbi to move more
	freely and better reflect market supply and demand. On August&nbsp;11, 12 and 13, 2015, the People&#146;s Bank of China significantly devalued the Renminbi by fixing its price against the U.S. dollar 1.9%, 1.6%, and 1.1% lower than the previous
	day&#146;s value, respectively. The value of the Renminbi depreciated approximately 5.8% against the U.S. dollar in 2015, and from December&nbsp;31, 2015 through January&nbsp;13, 2017, the value of Renminbi further depreciated approximately 6.1%
	against the U.S. dollar. It is difficult to predict how market forces or PRC or U.S. government policy may impact the exchange rate between the Renminbi and the U.S. dollar in the future. There remains significant international pressure on the PRC
	government to adopt a substantial liberalization of its currency policy, which could result in a further and more significant change in the value of the Renminbi against the U.S. dollar.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	To the extent that we need to convert our U.S. dollar denominated cash balance into Renminbi for our operations, appreciation of the Renminbi
	against the U.S. dollar would have an adverse effect on the Renminbi amount we receive from the conversion. Assuming we had converted the U.S. dollar denominated cash balance of $2.1&nbsp;million as of September&nbsp;30, 2016 into Renminbi at the
	exchange rate of $1.00 for RMB6.6685 as of September&nbsp;30, 2016, this cash balance would have been RMB13.7&nbsp;million. Assuming a further 1.0% appreciation of the Renminbi against the U.S. dollar, this cash balance would have decreased to
	RMB13.6&nbsp;million as of September&nbsp;30, 2016.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Very limited hedging transactions are available in China to reduce our exposure to
	exchange rate fluctuations. To date, we have not entered into any hedging transactions in an effort to reduce our exposure to foreign currency exchange risk. While we may decide to enter into hedging transactions in the future, the availability and
	effectiveness of these hedging transactions may be limited and we may not be able to successfully hedge our exposure at all. In addition, our currency exchange losses may be magnified by PRC exchange control regulations that restrict our ability to
	convert Renminbi into foreign currency.

	On August&nbsp;18, 2015, we adopted and publicly announced a share repurchase program approved by our board of directors. The program
	authorized us to repurchase up to $10.0&nbsp;million worth of our issued and outstanding ADSs from time to time in open market. The share repurchase program had an initial
<FONT STYLE="WHITE-SPACE:NOWRAP">
	one-year
</FONT>
	term and expired on
	August&nbsp;17, 2016. Our board of directors subsequently raised the repurchase quota on November&nbsp;11, 2015 by additional $10.0&nbsp;million of our ADSs and on February&nbsp;24, 2016 by another $20.0&nbsp;million of our ADSs (which makes the
	total repurchase quota under the share repurchase program $40.0&nbsp;million ADSs). In August, 2016, we concluded the share repurchase program. During the period of the share repurchase plan, we repurchased 3,115,924 ADSs on the open market for a
	consideration of $40.0&nbsp;million.

	We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of China Distance Education Holdings Limited, its subsidiaries, variable interest entities and the
	subsidiaries of their variable interest entities (collectively, the &#147;Group&#148;) as of September&nbsp;30, 2015 and 2016, and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, changes in equity, and cash flows for each of

</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we
	plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
	statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for
	our opinion.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Group as of
	September&nbsp;30, 2015 and 2016, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended September&nbsp;30, 2016, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
	America. Also, in our opinion, such financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic consolidated financial statements taken as a whole, present fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein.

	We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the Group&#146;s internal control

	is not considered impaired and the second step is not required. If the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, the second step of the impairment test measures the amount of the impairment loss, if any, by comparing the
	implied fair value of goodwill to its carrying amount. If the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value, an impairment loss is recognized equal to that excess. The implied fair value of goodwill is calculated in the same manner that
	goodwill is calculated in a business combination, whereby the fair value of the reporting unit is allocated to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit, with the excess purchase price over the amounts assigned to assets and liabilities
	representing the implied fair value of goodwill. The Group did not record any impairment loss related to goodwill for the years ended September&nbsp;30, 2014, 2015 and 2016.

	asset&#146;s fair value less costs to sell, an impairment loss is recognized for the difference. Assets held for sale are separately presented on the balance sheet and are no longer depreciated.

	organizations will be required to classify all deferred tax assets and liabilities as noncurrent. The amendments apply to all organizations that present a classified balance sheet. For public companies, the amendments are effective for financial
	statements issued for annual periods beginning after December&nbsp;15, 2016, and interim periods within those annual periods. Earlier application is permitted for all entities as of the beginning of an interim or annual reporting period. This ASU

	The authoritative guidance requires that the Group recognizes the impact of a tax position in the financial
	statements if that position is more likely than not of being sustained upon audit by the tax authority, based on the technical merits of the position. Under PRC laws and regulations, arrangements and transactions among related parties may be subject
	to examination by the PRC tax authorities. If the PRC tax authorities determine that the contractual arrangements among related companies do not represent a price under normal commercial terms, they may make adjustments to the companies&#146; income

	In addition, uncertainties exist with respect to how the current income tax law in the PRC applies to the Group&#146;s
	overall operations, and more specifically, with regard to tax residency status. The New EIT Law includes a provision specifying that legal entities organized outside of the PRC will be considered residents for Chinese Income tax purposes if the
	place of effective management or control is within the PRC. The implementation rules to the New EIT Law provide that
<FONT STYLE="WHITE-SPACE:NOWRAP">
	non-resident
</FONT>
	legal entities will be considered PRC residents if substantial and overall
	management and control over the manufacturing and business operations, personnel, accounting and properties, occurs within the PRC. Despite the present uncertainties resulting from the limited PRC tax guidance on the issue, the Group does not
	believe that the legal entities organized outside of the PRC within the Group should be treated as residents for EIT law purposes. If the PRC tax authorities subsequently determine that the Company and its subsidiaries registered outside the PRC
	should be deemed resident enterprises, the Company and its subsidiaries registered outside the PRC will be subject to the PRC income taxes, at a rate of 25%.

	In January 2016, the Group sold a 39.94% ownership of Zhengbao Yucai to a limited partnership
	entity, Beijing Champion Tongxin Management Consulting LLP (&#147;Tongxin&#148;), for a cash consideration of US$4,824. Mr Zhengdong Zhu, holds 53.11% interest of the partnership and serves as a co-general partner. All the partners in Tongxin are
	employees of the Group. The entire cash consideration was fully paid by the investors as of September&nbsp;30, 2016. As the Group retained control over Zhengbao Yucai subsequent to the above transactions, the disposal was accounted as an equity
	transaction in the Group&#146;s consolidated financial statements. Subsequent to the transaction, the Group&#146;s interest over Zhengbao Yucai was diluted to 60.06% as of September&nbsp;30, 2016.

	Group operated and managed its business as a single reporting segment which included the provision of online and offline education services and selling of related products. During the year ended September&nbsp;30, 2016, the Group determined that its

	On April&nbsp;18, 2008, the Company&#146;s shareholders approved the &#147;China Distance Education Holdings Limited Share Incentive Plan&#148;
	(the &#147;Prior Plan&#148;), which permits the grant of share options and shares to its employees and
<FONT STYLE="WHITE-SPACE:NOWRAP">
	non-employees
</FONT>
	(the &#147;Participants&#148;). The maximum number of ordinary shares that may be delivered
	pursuant to compensatory awards granted to the &#147;Participants&#148; under the Prior Plan should not exceed 11,652,556 ordinary shares of par value US$0.0001 per share. On July&nbsp;2, 2008, the Company&#146;s shareholders approved the
	&#147;China Distance Education Holdings Limited 2008 Performance Incentive Plan&#148; (the &#147;New Plan&#148;). Subject to any amendment of the New Plan, the maximum number of ordinary shares that may be issued pursuant to the New Plan is equal to
	5% of the total number of ordinary shares issued and outstanding as of August&nbsp;4, 2008, plus an automatic annual increase on October&nbsp;1 of each calendar year commencing with October&nbsp;1, 2008, by an amount equal to the lesser of (i) 1% of
	the total number of ordinary shares issued and outstanding on September&nbsp;30 of the same calendar year, or (ii)&nbsp;such number of ordinary shares as may be determined by the Company&#146;s board of directors. The purpose of these share
	incentive plans is to promote the success of the Company and the interests of its shareholders by providing a means through which the Company may grant equity-based incentives to attract, motivate, retain and reward certain officers, employees,
	directors and other eligible persons and to further link the interests of recipients with those of the Company&#146;s shareholders generally. The Prior Plan will expire on April&nbsp;17, 2018. The New Plan will expire on the tenth anniversary date
	of August&nbsp;4, 2008. Option awards are generally granted with an exercise price equal to the market price of the Company&#146;s stock at the date of grant; those option awards generally vest within 4 years of continuous service and have
<FONT STYLE="WHITE-SPACE:NOWRAP">
	10-year

	contractual terms. Share awards generally vest for 1 year.

	On May&nbsp;21, 2013, the
	Company&#146;s board of directors and compensation committee approved to cancel 400,000 options that were granted to the five directors on December&nbsp;2, 2008 with an exercise price per share equal to US$0.615. Since these options were fully
	vested and the corresponding share-based compensation was recognized before the cancellation date, no expense related to such options was recorded in the year ended September&nbsp;30, 2013.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; MARGIN-LEFT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">

	November&nbsp;17, 2009 with an exercise price per share equal to US$1.87 were cancelled. This cancellation resulted in an immediate recording of the remaining share-based compensation of US$146 in the year ended September&nbsp;30, 2013.

	On December&nbsp;3, 2014, the Company granted 125,000 nonvested restricted shares of the Company to its directors. These shares are restricted
	on transferability and will be forfeited if the directors cease to provide requisite service to the Company. The restriction will be removed upon the vesting of the nonvested restricted shares on the first anniversary of the issuance day. Before the
	removal of such restrictions, the holders of the nonvested shares shall be entitled to all rights and privileges of those of ordinary shareholders, and shall be entitled to voting rights and dividends. Therefore, these nonvested shares are
	considered participating securities for the purpose of net earnings per share calculation. The grant-date value of a nonvested restricted share was US$4.53, which was determined based on the closing price of the Company&#146;s ADSs on NYSE on
	December&nbsp;3, 2014. This grant resulted in a total share-based compensation of US$566, which was recognized ratably over the requisite service period of one year.
