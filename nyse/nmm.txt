	The cyclical nature of the international drybulk and container shipping industry may lead to decreases in charter rates and lower vessel values, resulting
	in decreased distributions to our common unitholders.
</B>
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The shipping business, including the dry cargo market, is cyclical in varying degrees,
	experiencing severe fluctuations in charter rates, profitability and, consequently, vessel values. For example, during the period from January&nbsp;1, 2014 to December&nbsp;31, 2015, the Baltic Exchange&#146;s Panamax time charter average daily
	rates experienced a low of $3,258 and a high of $14,188. Additionally, during the period from January&nbsp;1, 2014 to December&nbsp;31, 2015, the Baltic Exchange&#146;s Capesize time charter average (BCI-4TCA 172,000mt) daily rates experienced a low
	of $2,594 and a high of $35,316 and the Baltic Dry Index experienced a low of 471 points and a high of 2,113 points. While the BDI was 325 as of February&nbsp;25, 2016, there can be no assurance that the drybulk charter market will increase further,
	and the market could decline. We anticipate that the future demand for our drybulk carriers and drybulk charter rates will be dependent upon demand for imported commodities, economic growth in the emerging markets, including the Asia Pacific region,
	of which China is particularly important, India, Brazil and Russia and the rest of the world, seasonal and regional changes in demand and changes to the capacity of the world fleet. In past years, China and India have had two of the world&#146;s
	fastest growing economies in terms of gross domestic product and have been the main driving force behind increases in marine drybulk trade and the demand for drybulk vessels. If economic growth declines in China, Japan, India and other countries in
	the Asian region, we may face decreases in such drybulk trade and demand. For example, the recent slowdown of the Chinese economy has adversely affected demand for Capesize bulk carriers and, as a result, spot and period rates, as well as asset
	values, are currently at historical low levels. Moreover, a slowdown in the United States and Japanese economies or the economies of the European Union, as has occurred recently, or certain Asian countries will likely adversely affect economic
	growth in China, India and elsewhere. Adverse economic, political, social or other developments can decrease demand and prospects for growth in the shipping industry and thereby could reduce revenue significantly. A decline in demand for commodities
	transported in drybulk carriers or an increase in supply of drybulk vessels could cause a further decline in charter rates, which could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. If we sell a vessel at a time when
	the market value of our vessels has fallen, the sale may be at less than the vessel&#146;s carrying amount, resulting in a loss.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Demand for container
	shipments declined significantly from 2008 to 2009 in the aftermath of the global financial crisis but has increased each year from 2009 to 2015. From 2009 to 2011, there was improvement on the Far East-to-Europe and Trans-Pacific Eastbound
	container trade lanes, alongside improvements also witnessed on other, non-main lane, trade routes including certain intra-Asia and North-South trade routes. However, Trans-Pacific Eastbound trade lane growth was less than 1%&nbsp;per year in 2011
	and 2012, while the Far East to Europe trade was positive in 2011 but turned negative in 2012 due to the impact of the continuing European sovereign debt crisis and global economic slowdown, as well as uncertainty regarding the resolution of the
	budget ceiling and budgetary cuts in the United States. In 2014, worldwide trade volumes increased led by increases in the Trans Pacific Eastbound and Far East to Europe trade lanes as the US and Europe experienced improved growth. Since the second
	half of 2015, a slowdown in demand in certain key container trade routes, including the Asia to Europe route at a time of increased vessel supply, has resulted in an increase of the idle container fleet to 6.8%, which is the highest since early
	2010. The oversupply in our market continued to prevent any significant rise in time charter rates for both short- and long-term periods. Additional orders for large and very large containerships were placed during 2014 and 2015, both increasing the
	expected future supply of larger vessels and having a spillover effect on the market segment for smaller vessels. Liner companies have experienced a substantial drop-off in container shipping activity, resulting in decreased average freight rates
	since the second half of 2011, and the continuation of such decreased freight rates or any further declines in freight rates would negatively affect the liner companies to which we charter our containerships. The recent global economic slowdown and
	disruptions in the credit markets significantly reduced demand for products shipped in containers and, in turn, containership capacity.

	The continuation of such containership oversupply or any declines in container freight rates could negatively
	affect the liner companies to which we seek to charter our containerships. The decline in the containership market has affected the major liner companies and the value of container vessels, which follow the trends of freight rates and containership
	charter rates, and can affect the earnings on our charters, and similarly, our cash flows and liquidity. The decline in the containership charter market has had and may continue to have additional adverse consequences for the container industry,
	including a less active secondhand market for the sale of vessels and charterers not performing under, or requesting modifications of, existing time charters.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The current charter rates for
	drybulk and container vessels have significantly decreased from their historic highs reached in the second quarter of 2008. If the drybulk shipping industry, which has been highly cyclical, is depressed in the future when our charters expire, our
	earnings and available cash flow may be adversely affected. We cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully charter our vessels in the future or renew our existing charters at rates sufficient to allow us to operate our business
	profitably, to meet our obligations, including payment of debt service to our lenders, or to pay dividends to our unitholders. Our ability to renew the charters on our vessels upon the expiration or termination of our current charters, or on vessels
	that we may acquire in the future, as well as the charter rates payable under any replacement charters will depend upon, among other things, economic conditions in the sectors in which our vessels operate at that time, changes in the supply and
	demand for vessel capacity and changes in the supply and demand for the transportation of commodities.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	All of our drybulk time charters are scheduled to
	expire on dates ranging from April 2016 to September 2022. If, upon expiration or termination of these or other contracts, long-term recharter rates are lower than existing rates, particularly considering that we intend to enter into long-term
	charters, or if we are unable to obtain replacement charters, our earnings, cash flow and our ability to make cash distributions to our unitholders could be materially adversely affected.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Five of the eight containerships that we own are on long-term time charter for ten years until 2023 with our option to terminate after year seven. Two other
	owned containerships are on charter until 2018. The eighth containership is on charter until 2027. Our ability to re-charter our containerships upon the expiration or termination of their current time charters and the charter rates payable under any
	renewal options or replacement time charters will depend upon, among other things, the prevailing state of the containership charter market, which can be affected by consumer demand for products shipped in containers. If the charter market is
	depressed when our containerships&#146; time charters expire, we may be forced to re-charter our containerships at reduced or even unprofitable rates, or we may not be able to re-charter them at all, which may reduce or eliminate our earnings, make
	our earnings volatile, affect our ability to generate cash flows and maintain liquidity.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	One of our principal strategies is to enter into long-term
	charters, although we believe it is impractical to determine the typical charter length for vessels in our sectors due to factors such as market dynamics, charter strategy and the private nature of charter agreements. If a market for long-term time
	charters in the sectors in which we operate does not develop, we may have increased difficulty entering into long-term time charters upon expiration or early termination of the time charters for our vessels. As a result, our revenues and cash flows
	may become more volatile. In addition, an active short-term or spot charter market may require us to enter into charters based on changing market prices, as opposed to contracts based on fixed rates, which could result in a decrease in our revenues
	and cash flows, including cash available for distribution to unitholders, if we enter into charters during periods when the market price for shipping drybulk and containerized cargoes is depressed.

	The market supply of drybulk carriers has been increasing as a result of the delivery of numerous newbuilding orders over the last few years.
	Newbuildings have been delivered in significant numbers since the beginning of 2006 and, as of January&nbsp;1, 2016, newbuilding orders had been placed for an aggregate of more than 16% of the existing global drybulk fleet, with deliveries expected

	From 2005 through the first quarter of 2010, the containership order-book was at historically high levels as a percentage of the in-water fleet. Although
	order-book volumes have decreased as deliveries of previously ordered containerships increased substantially, some renewed ordering in 2012 maintained the order-book at average levels. During the period 2013 to 2015, ordering of larger vessels
	continued to increase as liner companies looked to renew and modernize their fleets as the number of vessels ordered has generally declined, but the average vessel size on order has increased. An oversupply of newbuilding vessels and/or vessels
	available for re-charter entering the market, combined with any future decline in the demand for containerships, may result in a reduction of charter rates and may decrease our ability to re-charter our containerships other than for reduced rates or

	Our significant maintenance and replacement capital expenditures may reduce or eliminate the amount of cash we have available for distribution to our
	unitholders. In each of October 2013,&nbsp;August 2014,&nbsp;February 2015 and February 2016, Navios&nbsp;Partners amended its existing management agreement with the Manager to fix the fees for ship management services of its owned fleet excluding
	drydocking expenses which are reimbursed at cost by Navios Partners at: (a)&nbsp;$4,100 daily rate per Ultra-Handymax vessel; (b)&nbsp;$4,200 daily rate per Panamax vessel; (c)&nbsp;$5,250 daily rate per Capesize vessel; (d)&nbsp;$6,700 daily rate
	per Container vessel of TEU 6,800; (e)&nbsp;$7,400 daily rate per Container vessel of more than TEU 8,000; and (f)&nbsp;$8,750 daily rate per very large Container vessel of more than TEU 13,000 through December&nbsp;31, 2017. Our partnership
	agreement requires our board of directors to deduct estimated, rather than actual, maintenance and replacement capital expenditures from operating surplus each quarter in an effort to reduce fluctuations in operating surplus. The amount of estimated
	capital expenditures deducted from operating surplus is subject to review and change by the conflicts committee of our board of directors at least once a year. If our board of directors underestimates the appropriate level of estimated maintenance
	and replacement capital expenditures, we may have less cash or no available for distribution in future periods when actual capital expenditures begin to exceed previous estimates.

	If we expand the size of our fleet in the future, we generally will be required to make significant

	cash from the operation of the vessel. We rely on the master limited partnership (&#147;MLP&#148;) structure and its appeal to investors for accessing debt and equity markets to finance our growth and repay or refinance our debt. The recent drop in
	energy prices has, among other factors, caused increased volatility and contributed to a dislocation in pricing for MLPs compared to their recent pricing history. The depressed trading price of our common units may affect our ability to access

	among other things, general economic conditions and contingencies and uncertainties that are beyond our control. Our failure to obtain the funds for necessary future capital expenditures could have a material adverse effect on our business, results
	of operations and financial condition and on our ability to make cash distributions. Even if we successfully obtain necessary funds, the terms of such financings could limit our ability to pay cash distributions to unitholders. In addition,
	incurring additional debt may significantly increase our interest expense and financial leverage, and issuing additional preferred and common equity securities may result in significant unitholder dilution and would increase the aggregate amount of

	Our ability to service our debt depends upon, among other things, our future financial and operating performance,
	which will be affected by prevailing economic conditions and financial, business, regulatory and other factors, some of which are beyond our control. Our ability to service debt under our credit facilities also will depend on market interest rates,
	since the interest rates applicable to our borrowings will fluctuate with the London Interbank Offered Rate, or LIBOR, or the prime rate. We do not currently hedge against increases in such rates and, accordingly, significant increases in such rate
	would require increased debt levels and reduce distributable cash. If our operating results are not sufficient to service our current or future indebtedness, we will be forced to take actions such as reducing distributions, reducing or delaying our

	Unlike newbuilding vessels, secondhand vessels typically do not carry warranties as to their condition. While we
	generally inspect existing vessels prior to purchase, such an inspection would normally not provide us with as much knowledge of a vessel&#146;s condition as we would possess if it had been built for us and operated by us during its life. Repairs
	and maintenance costs for secondhand vessels are difficult to predict and may be substantially higher than for vessels we have operated since they were built. These costs could decrease our cash flows, liquidity and our ability to pay dividends to

	Our growth strategy focuses on expansion in the drybulk and container shipping sectors. Accordingly,
	our growth depends on continued growth in world and regional demand for drybulk commodities, finished or semi-finished goods and the shipping of drybulk and containerized cargoes, which could be negatively affected by a number of factors, such as
	declines in prices for drybulk commodities or containerized cargoes, or general political and economic conditions.

	Reduced demand for drybulk commodities
	and the shipping of drybulk and containerized cargoes would have a material adverse effect on our future growth and could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition. In particular, Asian Pacific economies, of which China is
	especially important, and India have been the main driving force behind the current increase in seaborne drybulk trade and the demand for drybulk carriers. The Asian Pacific (particularly the Chinese) and Indian economies have also been significant
	suppliers of manufactured goods currently shipped by container to the developed markets of the OECD. A negative change in economic conditions in any Asian Pacific country, but particularly in China, Japan or India, may have a material adverse effect
	on our business, financial condition and results of operations, as well as our future prospects, by reducing demand and resultant charter rates.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	China imports significant quantities of raw materials. For example in 2015, China imported 940&nbsp;million tons
	of iron out of a total of 1.367 billion tons shipped globally accounting for about 69% of the global seaborne iron ore trade. While it only accounted for 14% of seaborne coal movements of coal in 2015 according to current estimates, that is a
	decline from over 22% in 2013 (264 million tons imported compared to 1.179 billion tons of seaborne coal traded globally). Our dry bulk vessels are deployed by our charterers on routes involving dry bulk trade in and out of emerging markets, and our
	charterers&#146; dry bulk shipping and business revenue may be derived from the shipment of goods within and to the Asia Pacific region from various overseas export markets. Any reduction in or hindrance to China-based importers could have a
	material adverse effect on the growth rate of China&#146;s imports and on our charterers&#146; business. For instance, the government of China has implemented economic policies aimed at reducing pollution, increasing consumption of domestically
	produced Chinese coal or promoting the export of such coal. This may have the effect of reducing the demand for import of raw materials and may, in turn, result in a decrease in demand for dry bulk shipping. Additionally, though in China there is an
	increasing level of autonomy and a gradual shift in emphasis to a &#147;market economy&#148; and enterprise reform, many of the reforms, particularly some limited price reforms that result in the prices for certain commodities being principally
	determined by market forces, are unprecedented or experimental and may be subject to revision, change or abolition. The level of imports to and exports from China could be adversely affected by changes to these economic reforms by the Chinese
	government, as well as by changes in political, economic and social conditions or other relevant policies of the Chinese government.

	It is likely that we will face substantial competition
	for long-term charter business from a number of experienced companies. We may not be able to compete profitably as we expand our business into new geographic regions or provide new services. New markets may require different skills, knowledge or
	strategies that we use in our current markets. Many of these competitors have significantly greater financial resources than we do. It is also likely that we will face increased numbers of competitors entering into our transportation sectors,
	including in the drybulk sector. Many of these competitors have strong reputations and extensive resources and experience. Increased competition may cause greater price competition, especially for long-term charters.

	As a result of these factors, we may be unable to expand our relationships with existing customers or obtain new customers for long-term charters on a

	spot trading may be more profitable. If we cannot successfully employ our vessels in profitable time charters our results of operations and operating cash flow could be adversely affected.

	We operate a fleet of dry cargo vessels that are subject to national
	and international laws governing pollution from such vessels. Several international conventions impose and limit pollution liability from vessels. An owner of a tanker vessel carrying a cargo of &#147;persistent oil&#148; as defined by the
	International Convention for Civil Liability for Oil Pollution Damage (the &#147;CLC&#148;) is subject under the convention to strict liability for any pollution damage caused in a contracting state by an escape or discharge from cargo or bunker
	tanks. This liability is subject to a financial limit calculated by reference to the tonnage of the ship, and the right to limit liability may be lost if the spill is caused by the shipowner&#146;s intentional or reckless conduct. Liability may also
	be incurred under the CLC for a bunker spill from the vessel even when she is not carrying such cargo, but is in ballast.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	When a tanker is carrying clean
	oil products that do not constitute &#147;persistent oil&#148; that would be covered under the CLC, liability for any pollution damage will generally fall outside the CLC and will depend on other international conventions or domestic laws in the
	jurisdiction where the spillage occurs. The same principle applies to any pollution from the vessel in a jurisdiction which is not a party to the CLC. The CLC applies in over 100 jurisdictions around the world, but it does not apply in the United
	States, where the corresponding liability laws such as the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (the &#147;OPA&#148;) discussed below, are particularly stringent.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	For vessel operations not covered by the CLC, including those operated under our fleet, at present, international liability for oil pollution is governed by
	the International Convention on Civil Liability for Bunker Oil Pollution Damage (the &#147;Bunker Convention&#148;). In 2001, the IMO adopted the Bunker Convention, which imposes strict liability on shipowners for pollution damage and response costs
	incurred in contracting states caused by discharges, or threatened discharges, of bunker oil from all classes of ships not covered by the CLC. The Bunker Convention also requires registered owners of ships over a certain size to maintain insurance
	to cover their liability for pollution damage in an amount equal to the limits of liability under the applicable national or international limitation regime, including liability limits calculated in accordance with the Convention on Limitation of
	Liability for Maritime Claims 1976, as amended (the &#147;1976 Convention&#148;), discussed in more detail in the following paragraph. The Bunker Convention became effective in contracting states on November&nbsp;21, 2008 and as of March 8, 2016 had
	82 contracting states comprising approximately 92.13% of the gross tonnage of the world&#146;s merchant fleet. In non-contracting states, liability for such bunker oil pollution typically is determined by the national or other domestic laws in the
	jurisdiction where the spillage occurs.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The CLC and Bunker Convention also provide vessel owners a right to limit their liability, depending on the
	applicable national or international regime. The CLC includes its own liability limits. The 1976 Convention is the most widely applicable international regime limiting maritime pollution liability. Rights to limit liability under the 1976 Convention
	are forfeited where a spill is caused by a shipowner&#146;s intentional or reckless conduct. Certain jurisdictions have ratified the IMO&#146;s Protocol of 1996 to the 1976 Convention, referred to herein as the &#147;Protocol of 1996.&#148; The
	Protocol of 1996 provides for substantially higher liability limits in those jurisdictions than the limits set forth in the 1976 Convention. Finally, some jurisdictions, such as the United States, are not a party to either the 1976 Convention or the
	Protocol of 1996, and, therefore, a shipowner&#146;s rights to limit liability for maritime pollution in such jurisdictions may be uncertain.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Environmental legislation in the United States merits particular mention as it is in many respects more onerous than international laws, representing a

	Such regulation may become even stricter if laws are changed as a result of the April 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico. In the United States, the OPA establishes an
	extensive regulatory and liability regime for the protection and cleanup of the environment from cargo and bunker oil spills from vessels, including tankers. The OPA covers all owners and operators whose vessels trade in the United States, its
	territories and possessions or whose vessels operate in United States waters, which includes the United States&#146; territorial sea and its 200 nautical mile exclusive economic zone (the &#147;EEZ&#148;). Under the OPA, vessel owners, operators and
	bareboat charterers are &#147;responsible parties&#148; and are jointly, severally and strictly liable (unless the spill results solely from the act or omission of a third party, an act of God or an act of war) for all containment and clean-up costs
	and other damages arising from discharges or substantial threats of discharges, of oil from their vessels. In response to the 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil incident in the Gulf of Mexico, the U.S. House of Representatives passed and the U.S. Senate
	considered but did not pass a bill to strengthen certain requirements of the OPA; similar legislation may be introduced in the future.

	In addition to
	potential liability under the federal OPA, vessel owners may in some instances incur liability on an even more stringent basis under state law in the particular state where the spillage occurred. For example, California regulations prohibit the

	In recent years, the EU has become increasingly active in the field of regulation of maritime safety and protection of the environment. In some
	areas of regulation the EU has introduced new laws without attempting to procure a corresponding amendment to international law. Notably, in 2005 the EU adopted a directive, as amended in 2009, on ship-source pollution, imposing criminal sanctions
	for pollution not only where pollution is caused by intent or recklessness (which would be an offence under MARPOL), but also where it is caused by &#147;serious negligence.&#148; The concept of &#147;serious negligence&#148; may be interpreted in
	practice to be little more than ordinary negligence. The directive could therefore result in criminal liability being incurred in circumstances where it would not be incurred under international law.

	energy production, and to improve the response mechanisms in case of an accident. The Directive was implemented on July&nbsp;19, 2015. As far as the environment is concerned, the UK has various new or amended regulations such as: the Offshore
	Petroleum Activities (Offshore Safety Directive) (Environmental Functions) Regulations 2015 (OSDEF), the 2015 amendments to the Merchant Shipping (Oil Pollution Preparedness, Response and Cooperation Convention) Regulations 1998 (OPRC 1998) and
	other environmental Directive requirements, specifically the Environmental Management System. The Offshore Petroleum Licensing (Offshore Safety Directive) Regulations 2015 will implement the licensing Directive requirements.

	We are and will be, directly and indirectly, subject to the effects of climate change and may, directly or indirectly, be

	In addition, while the emissions of greenhouse gases from international shipping are not subject to the Kyoto Protocol to the United Nations Framework
	Convention on Climate Change, which requires adopting countries to implement national programs to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, the IMO intends to develop limits on greenhouse gases from international shipping. It has responded to the global
	focus on climate change and greenhouse gas emissions by developing specific technical and operational efficiency measures and a work plan for market-based mechanisms in 2011. These include the mandatory measures of the ship energy efficiency
	management plan (&#147;SEEMP&#148;), outlined above, and an energy efficiency design index (&#147;EEDI&#148;) for new ships. The IMO is also considering its position on market-based measures through an expert working group. Among the numerous
	proposals being considered by the working group are the following: a port state levy based on the amount of fuel consumed by the vessel on its voyage to the port in question; a global emissions trading scheme which would allocate emissions
	allowances and set an emissions cap; and an international fund establishing a global reduction target for international shipping, to be set either by the UNFCCC or the IMO. At its 64th session (2012), the MEPC indicated that 2015 was the target year
	for Member States to identify market-based measures for international shipping. At its 66th session (2014), the MEPC continued its work on developing technical and operational measures relating to energy-efficiency measures for ships, following the
	entry into force of the mandatory efficiency measures on January&nbsp;1, 2013,. It adopted the 2014 Guidelines on the Method of Calculation of the Attained EEDI, applicable to new ships. It further adopted amendments to MARPOL Annex VI concerning
	the extension of the scope of application of the EEDI to LNG carriers, ro-ro cargo ships (vehicle carriers), ro-ro cargo ships, ro-ro passenger ships and cruise passengers ships with nonconventional propulsion. At its 67th session (2014), the MEPC
	adopted the 2014 Guidelines on survey and certification of the EEDI, updating the previous version to reference ships fitted with dual-fuel engines using LNG and liquid fuel oil. The MEPC also adopted amendments to the 2013 Interim Guidelines for
	determining minimum propulsion power to maintain the manoeuvrability of ships in adverse conditions, to make the guidelines applicable to phase 1 (starting January&nbsp;1, 2015) of the EEDI requirements. At its 68th session (2015), the MEPC agreed
	upon proposed language regarding a data collection system for fuel consumption of ships above 5,000 gross tons, a concept first proposed at MEPC 66. Further, the MEPC amended the 2014 Guidelines on EEDI survey and certification as well as the method
	of calculating of EEDI for new ships.

	out a strategy for progressively including greenhouse gas emissions from maritime transport in the EU&#146;s policy for reducing its overall GHG emissions. The first step proposed by the EC was an EU Regulation to an EU-wide system for the
	monitoring, reporting and verification of carbon dioxide emissions from large ships starting in 2018. The Regulation was adopted on April&nbsp;29, 2015 and took effect on July&nbsp;1, 2015, with monitoring, reporting and verification requirements

	During the last few years, the scope of sanctions

	of 2012 (&#147;IFCA&#148;). The foregoing laws, among other things, expanded the application of prohibitions to non-U.S. companies, such as our company, and introduced limits on the ability of companies and persons to do business or trade with Iran
	when such activities relate to specific activities such as investment in Iran, the supply or export of refined petroleum or refined petroleum products to Iran, the supply and delivery of goods to Iran which could enhance Iran&#146;s petroleum or

	The operation of vessels, such as drybulk carriers, has certain unique risks. With a drybulk carrier, the
	cargo itself and its interaction with the vessel can be an operational risk. By their nature, drybulk cargoes are often heavy, dense, easily shift, and react badly to water exposure. In addition, drybulk carriers are often subjected to battering
	treatment during unloading operations with grabs, jackhammers (to pry encrusted cargoes out of the hold) and small bulldozers. This treatment may cause damage to the vessel. Vessels damaged due to treatment during unloading procedures may be more
	susceptible to breach to the sea. Hull breaches in drybulk carriers may lead to the flooding of the vessels&#146; holds. If a drybulk carrier suffers flooding in its forward holds, the bulk cargo may become so dense and waterlogged that its pressure
	may buckle the vessel&#146;s bulkheads leading to the loss of a vessel.

	requisitions occur during periods of war or emergency, although governments may elect to requisition vessels in other circumstances. Requisition of one or more of our vessels would have a substantial negative effect on us as we would potentially
	lose all revenues and earnings from the requisitioned vessels and permanently lose the vessels. Such losses might be partially offset if the requisitioning government compensated us for the requisition.

	Acts of piracy on ocean-going vessels have increased in frequency and magnitude, which could adversely affect our business.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The shipping industry has historically been affected by acts of piracy in regions such as the South China Sea, the Indian Ocean, the Gulf of Aden off the coast
	of Somalia and the Red Sea. Although the frequency of sea piracy worldwide has decreased in recent years, sea piracy incidents continue to occur, particularly in the Gulf of Aden and towards the Mozambique Channel in the North Indian Ocean and
	increasingly in the Gulf of Guinea. A significant example of the heightened level of piracy came in February 2011 when the M/V Irene SL, a crude oil tanker which was not affiliated with us, was captured by pirates in the Arabian Sea while carrying
	crude oil estimated to be worth approximately $200&nbsp;million. In December 2009, the Navios Apollon, one of our vessels, was seized by pirates 800&nbsp;miles off the coast of Somalia while transporting fertilizer from Tampa, Florida to Rozi, India
	and was released on February&nbsp;27, 2010. In January 2014, a vessel owned by our affiliate, Navios Maritime Acquisition Corporation, the Nave Atropos, came under attack from a pirate action group in international waters off the coast of Yemen and
	in February 2016, the Nave Jupiter, a vessel also owned by Navios Acquisition, came under attack from pirate action groups on her way out from her loading terminal about 50NM off Bayelsa, Nigeria. In both instances,&nbsp;the crew and the on-board
	security team successfully implemented the counter piracy action plan and standard operating procedures to deter the attack with no consequences to the vessels or their crew. These piracy attacks resulted in regions (in which our vessels are
	deployed) being characterized by insurers as &#147;war risk&#148; zones or Joint War Committee (JWC) &#147;war and strikes&#148; listed areas. Premiums payable for such insurance coverage could increase significantly and such insurance coverage may
	be more difficult to obtain. Crew costs, including those due to employing onboard security guards, could increase in such circumstances. While the use of security guards is intended to deter and prevent the hijacking of our vessels, it could also
	increase our risk of liability for death or injury to persons or damage to personal property. In addition, while we believe the charterer remains liable for charter payments when a vessel is seized by pirates, the charterer may dispute this and
	withhold charter hire until the vessel is released. A charterer may also claim

	Global financial markets and economic conditions have been severely disrupted and volatile in recent years and remain subject to significant vulnerabilities,
	such as the deterioration of fiscal balances and the rapid accumulation of public debt, continued deleveraging in the banking sector and a limited supply of credit. The renewed crisis in Argentina, civil unrest in Ukraine and other parts of the
	world, and continuing concerns relating to the European sovereign debt crisis have led to increased volatility in global credit and equity markets.&nbsp;Several European countries, including Greece, have been affected by increasing public debt
	burdens and weakening economic growth prospects. In recent years, Standard and Poor&#146;s Rating Services and Moody&#146;s Investors Service downgraded the long-term ratings of most European countries&#146; sovereign debt and initiated negative
	outlooks. Such downgrades could negatively affect those countries&#146; ability to access the public debt markets at reasonable rates or at all, materially affecting the financial conditions of banks in those countries, including those with which we

	Recently, a number of financial institutions have experienced serious financial difficulties and, in some cases, have entered bankruptcy proceedings or are in
	regulatory enforcement actions. These difficulties resulted, in part, from declining markets for assets held by such institutions, particularly the reduction in the value of their mortgage and asset-backed securities portfolios. These difficulties
	were compounded by financial turmoil affecting the world&#146;s debt, credit and capital markets, and the general decline in the willingness by banks and other financial institutions to extend credit, particularly to the shipping industry due to the
	historically low vessel earnings and values, and, in part, due to changes in overall banking regulations (for example, Basel III). As a result, the ability of banks and credit institutions to finance new projects, including the acquisition of new
	vessels in the future, were for a time uncertain. Following the stress tests run by the European Central Bank (the &#147;ECB&#148;),

	Our partnership affairs are governed by our partnership agreement and by the Marshall Islands Act. The provisions of the Marshall
	Islands Act resemble provisions of the limited partnership laws of a number of states in the United States, most notably Delaware. The Marshall Islands Act also provides that it is to be applied and construed to make it uniform with the Delaware
	Revised Uniform Partnership Act and, so long as it does not conflict with the Marshall Islands Act or decisions of the Marshall Islands courts, interpreted according to the non-statutory law (or case law) of the State of Delaware. There have been,
	however, few, if any, court cases in the Marshall Islands interpreting the Marshall Islands Act, in contrast to Delaware, which has a fairly well-developed body of case law interpreting its limited partnership statute. Accordingly, we cannot predict
	whether Marshall Islands courts would reach the same conclusions as the courts in Delaware. For example, the rights of our unitholders and the fiduciary responsibilities of our general partner under Marshall Islands law are not as clearly
	established as under judicial precedent in existence in Delaware. As a result, unitholders may have more difficulty in protecting their interests in the face of actions by our officers or directors than would unitholders of a similarly organized

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	We are an international owner and operator
	of drybulk and container vessels formed by Navios Holdings (NYSE: NM), a vertically integrated seaborne shipping company with over 60&nbsp;years of operating history in the dry cargo shipping industry. Our vessels are generally chartered-out under
	medium to long-term time charters with an average remaining term of approximately three&nbsp;years to a strong group of counterparties, including Yang Ming Marine Transport Corporation, Cargill International S.A., Exelon Corporation (formerly
	Constellation Energy Group), Rio Tinto, Hyundai Merchant Marine Co., Ltd and Mediterranean Shipping Co. S.A.

	Suspension of Distributions
</B>
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	In February 2016, we announced that our board of directors decided to suspend the quarterly cash distributions to our unitholders including the distribution
	for the quarter ended December&nbsp;31, 2015 in order to conserve cash and improve our liquidity. Our board of directors and management believes such a decision is in the best long-term interests of the Company and its stakeholders. The board of
	directors will reassess the Company&#146;s distribution policy as the environment changes. For additional information, see &#147;Quarterly Distribution&#148; herein.

	Our Fleet

</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Navios Partners controls 12 Panamax vessels,
	eight Capesize vessels, three Ultra-Handymax vessels and eight Container vessels. Our fleet of high quality dry cargo vessels has an average age of 8.7 years for drybulk and container vessels, which approximates the current industry average of about
	nine years for drybulk vessels and 11 years for container vessels, respectively (both industry average as of December&nbsp;31, 2015). Panamax vessels are highly flexible vessels capable of carrying a wide range of dry cargo commodities, including
	iron ore, coal, grain and fertilizer and being accommodated in most major discharge ports, while Capesize vessels are primarily dedicated to the carriage of iron ore and coal. Ultra-Handymax vessels are similar to Panamax vessels although with less
	carrying capacity and generally have self-loading and discharging gear on board to accommodate undeveloped ports. Container vessels are specifically constructed to transport containerized cargo. We may from time to time purchase additional vessels,
	including vessels from Navios Holdings.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	We generate revenues by charging our customers for the use of our vessels to transport their dry cargo
	commodities. In general, the vessels in our fleet are chartered-out under time charters, which range in length from one to ten years at inception. From time to time, we operate vessels in the spot market until the vessels have been chartered under
	long-term charters.

	High-quality, flexible fleet.
</I>
	&nbsp;Our fleet consists of 12 Panamax vessels, eight Capesize vessels, three Ultra-Handymax vessels and eight Container vessels. The average age of the vessels in our fleet
	approximates the average age of the world drybulk fleet. Our combined fleet had an average age of 8.7 years as of March 2016 (average age of 8.6 years for drybulk fleet and 8.4 years for containers fleet), compared to a current industry average age
	of about 8.8&nbsp;years for the drybulk fleet and 11.2&nbsp;years for the containers fleet (both industry averages as of December&nbsp;31, 2015). Panamax vessels are highly flexible vessels capable of carrying a wide range of drybulk commodities,
	including iron ore, coal, grain and fertilizer, and of being accommodated in most major discharge ports. Ultra-Handymax vessels are similar to Panamax vessels although with less carrying capacity and generally have self-loading and discharging gear
	on board to accommodate undeveloped ports. Capesize vessels are primarily dedicated to the carriage of iron ore and coal. Container vessels are designed to carry manufactured, finished or semi-finished goods in steel shipping containers or specific
	routes. We believe that our high-quality, flexible fleet provides us with a competitive advantage in the drybulk and container time charter market, where vessel age, flexibility and quality are of significant importance in competing for business.

	The drybulk shipping market is extensive, diversified, competitive and highly fragmented, divided among approximately 1,775 independent drybulk carrier owners.
	The world&#146;s active drybulk fleet consists of approximately 10,700 vessels, aggregating approximately 776&nbsp;million dwt as of December&nbsp;31, 2015. As a general principle, the smaller the cargo carrying capacity of a drybulk carrier, the
	more fragmented is its market, both with regard to charterers and vessel owner/operators. Even among the larger drybulk owners and operators, whose vessels are mainly in the larger sizes, only four companies are known to have fleets of 100 vessels
	or more after the merger of the two largest Chinese shipping companies, China Ocean Shipping and China Shipping Group into China COSCO Shipping. The other three are the largest Japanese shipping companies, Mitsui O.S.K. Lines, Kawasaki Kisen and
	Nippon Yusen Kaisha. There are about 45 owners known to have fleets of between 30 and 100 vessels. However, vessel ownership is not the only determining factor of fleet control. Many owners of bulk carriers charter their vessels out for extended
	periods, not just to end users (owners of cargo), but also to other owner/operators and to tonnage pools. Such operators may, at any given time, control a fleet many times the size of their owned tonnage. Navios Holdings is one such operator; others
	include Cargill, Pacific Basin Shipping, Bocimar, Zodiac Maritime, Louis Dreyfus/Cetragpa, Cobelfret, Torvald Klaveness and Swiss Marine.

	The container
	shipping market is extensive, diversified, competitive and fragmented, divided among approximately 613 liner operators and independent owners. The world&#146;s active containership fleet consists of approximately 5,100 vessels, aggregating
	approximately 18.3&nbsp;million TEU as of December&nbsp;31, 2015. As a general principle, the smaller the cargo carrying capacity of a containership, the more fragmented is its market, both with regard to charterers and vessel owner/operators. Even
	among the larger liner companies and containership owners and operators, whose vessels are mainly in the larger sizes, only ten companies are known to control fleets of 80 vessels or more: AP Moller, China COSCO Shipping, Mediterranean Shipping Co.
	(MSC), Evergreen, Pacific International Lines, Peter Dohle, Seaspan and CMA CGM. There are about 40 owners known to control fleets of between 27 and 80 vessels. However, vessel ownership is not the only determining factor of fleet control. Liner
	companies, who control the movement of containers on land and at sea, own vessels directly and charter in vessels on short and long-term charters. Many owners/managers of containerships charter their vessels out for extended periods but do not
	control the movement of any containers, the so called tonnage providers. Liner companies may, at any given time, control a fleet many times the size of their owned tonnage. AP Moller and MSC are such liner operators; whereas Peter Dohle, Seaspan and
	others including Navios Maritime Partners are tonnage providers.

	It is likely that we will face substantial competition for long-term charter business
	from a number of experienced companies. Many of these competitors will have significantly greater financial resources than we do. It is also likely that we will face increased numbers of competitors entering into our transportation sectors,
	including in the container and drybulk sectors. Many of these competitors have strong reputations and extensive resources and experience. Increased competition may cause greater price competition, especially for long-term charters.

	A time charter is a contract for the use
	of a vessel for a fixed period of time at a specified daily rate. Under a time charter, the vessel owner provides crewing and other services related to the vessel&#146;s operation, the cost of which is included in the daily rate and the customer is
	responsible for substantially all of the vessel voyage costs. All of the vessels in our fleet are hired out under time charters, and we intend to continue to hire out our vessels under time charters. The following discussion describes the material

	approximately 95% of the world&#146;s commercial tonnage and have entered into a pooling agreement to collectively reinsure each association&#146;s liabilities. Each vessel that Navios Partners acquires will be entered with P&amp;I Associations of
	the International Group. Under the International Group reinsurance program for the current policy year, each P&amp;I club in the International Group is responsible for the first $10.0&nbsp;million of every claim. In every claim the amount in excess
	of $10.0&nbsp;million and up to $80.0&nbsp;million is shared by the clubs under the pooling agreement. Any claim in excess of $80.0&nbsp;million is reinsured by the International Group in the international reinsurance market under the General Excess
	of Loss Reinsurance Contract. This policy currently provides an additional $2.0&nbsp;billion of coverage for non-oil pollution claims. Further to this, an additional reinsurance layer has been placed by the International Group for claims up to $1.0
	billion in excess of $2.08 billion, i.e. $3.08 billion in total. For passengers and crew claims, the overall limit is $3.0 billion for any one event on any one vessel with a sub-limit of $2.0 billion for passengers. With the exception of pollution,
	passenger or crew claims, should any other P&amp;I claim exceed Group reinsurance limits, the provisions of all International Group Club&#146;s overspill claim rules will operate and members of any International Group Club will be liable for
	additional contributions in accordance with such rules. To date, there has never been an overspill claim, or one even nearing this level.

	deductible, a limited indemnity for hire that would not be receivable by the shipowner for reasons set forth in the policy. Should a vessel on time charter, where the vessel is paid a fixed hire day by day, suffer a serious mechanical breakdown, the
	daily hire will no longer be payable by the charterer. The purpose of the loss of hire insurance is to secure the loss of hire during such periods. In the case of strikes insurance, if a vessel is being paid a fixed sum to perform a voyage and the
	ship becomes strike bound at a loading or discharging port, the insurance covers the loss of earnings during such periods.

	Shipping is one

	The International Maritime Organization, or IMO,

</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	In the former category the primary international instrument is the Safety of Life at Sea Convention of 1974, as amended, or SOLAS, together with the
	regulations and codes of practice that form part of its regime. Much of SOLAS is not directly concerned with preventing pollution, but some of its safety provisions are intended to prevent pollution as well as promote safety of life and preservation
	of property. These regulations have been and continue to be regularly amended as new and higher safety standards are introduced with which we are required to comply.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	An amendment of SOLAS introduced the International Safety Management (ISM) Code, which has been effective since July 1998. Under the ISM Code the party with
	operational control of a vessel is required to develop an extensive safety management system that includes, among other things, the adoption of a safety and environmental protection policy setting forth instructions and procedures for operating its
	vessels safely and describing procedures for responding to emergencies. The ISM Code requires that vessel operators obtain a safety management certificate for each vessel they operate. This certificate evidences compliance by a vessel&#146;s
	management with code requirements for a safety management system. No vessel can obtain a certificate unless its manager has been awarded a document of compliance, issued by the flag state for the vessel, under the ISM Code. Noncompliance with the
	ISM Code and other IMO regulations, such as the mandatory ship energy efficiency management plan (&#147;SEEMP&#148;) which is akin to a safety management plan and came into effect on 1&nbsp;January 2013, may subject a ship owner to increased
	liability, may lead to decreases in available insurance coverage for affected vessels, and may result in the denial of access to, or detention in, some ports. For example, the United States Coast Guard and European Union authorities have indicated
	that vessels not in compliance with the ISM Code will be prohibited from trading in ports in the United States and European Union.

	International regulations to prevent pollution from ships
</B>
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	In the second main category of international regulation, the primary instrument is the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships, or
	MARPOL, which imposes environmental standards on the shipping industry set out in Annexes I-VI of MARPOL. These contain regulations for the prevention of pollution by oil (Annex I), by noxious liquid substances in bulk (Annex II), by harmful
	substances in packaged forms within the scope of the International Maritime Dangerous Goods Code (Annex III), by sewage (Annex IV), by garbage (Annex V), and by air emissions (Annex VI).
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	These regulations have been and continue to be regularly amended as new and more stringent standards of pollution prevention are introduced with which we are
	required to comply. For example, MARPOL Annex VI, together with the NOx Technical Code established thereunder, sets limits on sulfur oxide and nitrogen oxide emissions from ship exhausts and prohibits deliberate emissions of ozone depleting
	substances, such as chlorofluorocarbons. It also includes a global cap on the sulfur content of fuel oil and allows for special areas to be established with more stringent controls on emissions. Originally adopted in September 1997, Annex VI came
	into force in May 2005 and was amended in October 2008 (as was the NOx Technical Code) to provide for progressively more stringent limits on such emissions from 2010 onwards. The revised Annex VI provides, in particular, for a reduction of the
	global sulfur cap, initially to 3.5% (from the previous cap of 4.5%), with effect from January&nbsp;1, 2012, then progressively reducing to 0.50% effective from January&nbsp;1, 2020, subject to a feasibility review to be completed no later than 2018
	(regarding the availability of compliant fuel which could defer the requirement to January&nbsp;1, 2025); and the establishment of new tiers of stringent nitrogen oxide emissions standards for marine engines, depending on their date of installation.
	We anticipate incurring costs in complying with these more stringent standards. At MEPC 68 (2015), draft amendments to Annex VI were approved for additional record requirements for operational compliance with NOx Tier III emission control areas, and
	are set for adoption in MEPC 69 (2016).
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The revised Annex VI further allows for designation, in response to proposals from member parties, of Emission
	Control Areas (ECAs) that impose accelerated and/or more stringent requirements for control of sulfur oxide, particulate matter, and nitrogen oxide emissions. Thus far, ECAs have been formally adopted for the Baltic Sea area (limits SOx emissions
	only); the North Sea area including the English Channel (limiting SOx emissions only) and the North American ECA (which came into effect from August&nbsp;1, 2012 limiting SOx, NOx and particulate matter emissions). The United States Caribbean Sea
	ECA entered into force on January&nbsp;1, 2013 and has been effective since January&nbsp;1, 2014, limiting SOx, NOx and particulate matter emissions. For the currently-designated ECAs, much lower sulfur limits on fuel oil content are being phased in
	(0.1% from January&nbsp;1, 2015). At its 66th Session, the MEPC adopted amendments (effective September 2015) to Annex VI, regulation 13, regarding NOx and the date for the implementation of the &#147;Tier III&#148; standards within ECAs. These
	amendments provide, inter alia, that such standards, applicable on January&nbsp;1, 2016, apply to marine diesel engines installed on ships which operate in the North American ECA or the U.S. Caribbean Sea ECA and to installed marine diesel engines
	which operate in other ECAs which might be designated in the future for Tier III NOx control. At its 68th session, the MEPC requested that the IMO Secretariat begin a review by September&nbsp;1, 2015 of the availability of fuel compliant with
	regulation 14 of Annex VI (SOx and particulate matter), which requires sulfur content of fuel oil on board ships to be at or below 0.50% m/m by January&nbsp;1, 2010. These more

	In December 2011, UN climate change talks took place in Durban and concluded with an agreement referred to
	as the Durban Platform for Enhanced Action. In preparation for the Durban Conference, the International Chamber of Shipping (&#147;ICS&#148;) produced a briefing document, confirming the shipping industry&#146;s commitment to cut shipping emissions
	by 20% by 2020, with significant further reductions thereafter. The ICS called on the participants in the Durban Conference to give the IMO a clear mandate to deliver emissions reductions through market-based measures, for example a shipping
	industry environmental compensation fund. Notwithstanding the ICS&#146;s request for global regulation of the shipping industry, the Durban Conference did not result in any proposals specifically addressing the shipping industry&#146;s role in
	climate change. The European Union announced in April 2007 that it planned to expand the European Union emissions trading scheme by adding vessels, and a proposal from the European Commission was expected if no global regime for reduction of
	seaborne emissions had been agreed by the end of 2011. As of January&nbsp;31, 2013, the Commission stopped short of proposing that emissions from ships be included in the EU&#146;s emissions-trading scheme (&#147;ETS&#148;). However, on

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	European regulations in the maritime sector are in general based on international law. However, since the
<I>
	Erika
</I>
	incident in 1999, the European Community
	has become increasingly active in the field of regulation of maritime safety and protection of the environment. It has been the driving force behind a number of amendments of MARPOL (including, for example, changes to accelerate the time-table for
	the phase-out of single hull tankers, and to prohibit the carriage in such tankers of heavy grades of oil), and if dissatisfied either with the extent of such amendments or with the time-table for their introduction it has been prepared to legislate
	on a unilateral basis. It should be noted, for instance, that the EU has its own regime as far as ship emissions are concerned and whilst it does in some respects reflect the IMO regime, this is not always the case. As far as sulfur dioxide
	emissions are concerned, for example, the EU regulation has not just caught up with the IMO limits for sulfur in ECAs, but it continues to have certain elements that exceed IMO regulations (e.g., as of January&nbsp;1, 2015, EU Member States must
	ensure that ships in the Baltic, the North Seam and the English Channel are using gas oils with a sulfur content of no more than 0.10%).

	In some
	instances where it has done so, international regulations have subsequently been amended to the same level of stringency as that introduced in Europe, but the risk is well established that EU regulations may from time to time impose burdens and
	costs on shipowners and operators which are additional to those involved in complying with international rules and standards.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	In some areas of regulation
	the EU has introduced new laws without attempting to procure a corresponding amendment of international law. Notably, it adopted in 2005 a directive on ship-source pollution, imposing criminal sanctions for pollution not only where this is caused by
	intent or recklessness (which would be an offense under MARPOL), but also where it is caused by &#147;serious negligence.&#148; The directive could therefore result in criminal liability being incurred in circumstances where it would not be incurred
	under international law. Experience has shown that in the emotive atmosphere often associated with pollution incidents, retributive attitudes towards ship interests have found expression in negligence being alleged by prosecutors and found by
	courts. Moreover, there is skepticism that the notion of &#147;serious negligence&#148; is likely to prove any narrower in practice than ordinary negligence. Criminal liability for a pollution incident could not only result in us incurring
	substantial penalties or fines but may also, in some jurisdictions, facilitate civil liability claims for greater compensation than would otherwise have been payable.

	consequences, thus increasing the protection of the marine environment and coastal economies against pollution, establishing minimum conditions for safe offshore exploration and exploitation of oil and gas and limiting possible disruptions to Union
	indigenous energy production, and to improve the response mechanisms in case of an accident. Member states must implement the Directive by July&nbsp;19, 2015. As far as the environment is concerned, the UK has various new or amended regulations such

	The United States
	Clean Water Act (&#147;CWA&#148;) prohibits the discharge of oil or hazardous substances in U.S. navigable waters and imposes strict liability in the form of penalties for unauthorized discharges. The CWA also imposes substantial liability for the
	costs of removal, remediation and damages and complements the remedies available under CERCLA. The EPA regulates the discharge of ballast water and other substances incidental to the normal operation of vessels in U.S. waters using a Vessel General
	Permit (VGP) system pursuant to the CWA, in order to combat the risk of harmful organisms that can travel in ballast water carried from foreign ports and to minimize the risk of water pollution through numerous specified effluent streams incidental
	to the normal operation of vessels. Compliance with the conditions of the VGP is required for commercial vessels 79 feet in length or longer (other than commercial fishing vessels.) On March&nbsp;28, 2013 the EPA adopted the 2013 VGP which took
	effect on December&nbsp;19, 2013. The 2013 VGP is valid for five years. This new 2013 VGP imposes a numeric standard to control the release of non-indigenous invasive species in ballast water discharges. On October&nbsp;5, 2015, the U.S. Court of
	Appeals for the Second Circuit found the EPA was arbitrary and capricious in issuing the ballast water provisions of the VCP, finding EPA failed to adequately explain why stricter technology-based effluent standards should not be applied. The court
	instructed EPA to reconsider these issues but held the 2013 VCP remains in effect until EPA addresses the issues. If EPA establishes more stringent numeric standards for ballast water discharges, we may incur costs to modify our vessels to comply
	with new standards. In addition, through the CWA certification provisions that allow U.S. states to place additional conditions on use of the VGP within state waters, a number of states have proposed or implemented a variety of stricter ballast
	water requirements including, in some states, specific treatment standards.

	We operate a fleet of dry cargo vessels that are subject to national and international laws governing pollution from such vessels. Several international
	conventions impose and limit pollution liability from vessels. An owner of a tanker vessel carrying a cargo of &#147;persistent oil&#148; as defined by the International Convention for Civil Liability for Oil Pollution Damage (the &#147;CLC&#148;)
	is subject under the convention to strict liability for any pollution damage caused in a contracting state by an escape or discharge from cargo or bunker tanks. This liability is subject to a financial limit calculated by reference to the tonnage of
	the ship, and the right to limit liability may be lost if the spill is caused by the shipowner&#146;s intentional or reckless conduct. Liability may also be incurred under the CLC for a bunker spill from the vessel even when she is not carrying such
	cargo, but is in ballast.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	When a tanker is carrying clean oil products that do not constitute &#147;persistent oil&#148; that would be covered under the
	CLC, liability for any pollution damage will generally fall outside the CLC and will depend on other international conventions or domestic laws in the jurisdiction where the spillage occurs. The same principle applies to any pollution from the
	vessel in a jurisdiction which is not a party to the CLC. The CLC applies in over 100 jurisdictions around the world, but it does not apply in the United States, where the corresponding liability laws such as the OPA discussed above, are

	Outside the United States, national laws generally provide for the owner to bear strict liability for

	limit liability under the 1976 Convention are forfeited where a spill is caused by a shipowners&#146; intentional or reckless conduct. Some states have ratified the 1996 LLMC Protocol to the 1976 Convention, which provides for liability limits
	substantially higher than those set forth in the 1976 Convention to apply in such states. Finally, some jurisdictions are not a party to either the 1976 Convention or the 1996 LLMC Protocol, and, therefore, shipowners&#146; rights to limit liability

	In order to meet the &#147;Publicly Traded Test&#148;, the equity interests in the non-U.S.&nbsp;corporation at
	issue must be &#147;primarily traded&#148; and &#147;regularly traded&#148; on an established securities market either in the United States or in a jurisdiction outside the United States that grants an Equivalent Exemption. The Section&nbsp;883
	Regulations generally provide, in pertinent part, that a class of equity interests in a non-U.S.&nbsp;corporation will be considered to be &#147;primarily traded&#148; on an established securities market in a given country if the number of units of
	such class that are traded during any taxable year on all established securities markets in that country exceeds the number of units in such class that are traded during that year on established securities markets in any other single country. Equity
	interests in a non-U.S.&nbsp;corporation will be considered to be &#147;regularly traded&#148; on an established securities market under the Section&nbsp;883 Regulations provided one or more classes of such equity interests representing more than
	50.0% of the aggregate vote and value of all of the outstanding equity interests in the non-U.S.&nbsp;corporation satisfy certain listing and trading volume requirements. These listing and trading volume requirements are satisfied with respect to a
	class of equity interests listed on an established securities market provided trades in such class are effected, other than in de minimis quantities, on such market on at least 60&nbsp;days during the taxable year and the aggregate number of units
	in such class that are traded on such market or markets during the taxable year are at least 10% of the average number of units outstanding in that class during the taxable year (with special rules for short taxable years). In addition, a class of
	equity interests traded on an established securities market in the United States will be considered to satisfy the listing and trading volume requirements if the equity interests in such class are &#147;regularly quoted by dealers making a
	market&#148; in such class (within the meaning of the Section&nbsp;883 Regulations). Notwithstanding these rules, a class of equity that would otherwise be treated as &#147;regularly traded&#148; on an established securities market will not be so
	treated if, for more than half of the number of days during the taxable year, one or more &#147;5.0% unitholders&#148; (i.e., unitholders owning, actually or constructively, at least 5.0% of the vote and value of that class) own in the aggregate
	50.0% or more of the vote and value of that class (the &#147;Closely Held Block Exception&#148;), unless the corporation can establish that a sufficient proportion of such 5.0% unitholders are Qualified Shareholders (as defined below) so as to
	preclude other persons who are 5.0% unitholders from owning 50.0% or more of the value of that class for more than half the days during the taxable year.

	We generate revenues by charging our customers for the use of our vessels to transport their dry cargos. In general, the vessels in our fleet are chartered-out
	under time charters, which range in length from one to eleven years at inception. From time to time, we operate vessels in the spot market until the vessels have been chartered under long-term charters.

	For the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2015, Navios Partners&#146; customers representing 10% or more of total revenues were Hyundai Merchant Marine Co., Ltd.,
	Navios Corporation and Yang Ming Marine Transport Corporation, which accounted for approximately 24.0%, 17.4% and 11.4%, respectively, of total revenues. For the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2014, Navios Partners&#146; customers representing 10% or
	more of total revenues were Hyundai Merchant Marine Co., Ltd and Navios Corporation, which accounted for 24.4% and 11.0%, respectively, of total revenues. We believe that the combination of the long-term nature of our charters (which provide for the
	receipt of a fixed fee for the life of the charter) and our management agreement with the Manager, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Navios Holdings (which provides for a fixed management fee until December&nbsp;31, 2017), provides us with a strong base

	Time charters are available for

	Time charter and voyage revenues for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2015 decreased
	by $3.7&nbsp;million or 1.6% to $223.7&nbsp;million, as compared to $227.4&nbsp;million for the same period in 2014. The decrease was mainly attributable to the decrease in TCE to $19,739 per day for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2015, from
	$20,306 per day for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2014. The above decrease in time charter and voyage revenues was partially mitigated by an increase in revenue due to the delivery of the Navios La Paix and the Navios Sun in January 2014, the YM
	Utmost and the YM Unity in the second half of 2014 and the delivery of the MSC Cristina in April 2015. As a result of the vessel acquisitions, available days of the fleet increased to 11,051&nbsp;days for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2015, as

	reasonable costs and expenses incurred in connection with the provision of these services. Navios Partners extended the duration of its existing Administrative Services Agreement with the Manager pursuant to the same terms, until December&nbsp;31,

	life in 2014 (Refer to Note 7 &#151; Intangible Assets for further details); and (b)&nbsp;a $6.3 million decrease of amortization of the intangibles which were written off in the first quarter of 2014 for the Navios Orbiter, the Navios Hyperion and
	the Navios Pollux and the intangible for the Navios Fulvia which was written off in third quarter of 2015. The above decrease was primarily mitigated by&nbsp;an increase in depreciation expense of $6.7&nbsp;million due to the increased number of
	vessels that were delivered into our owned fleet. Depreciation of vessels is calculated using an estimated useful life of 25 and 30&nbsp;years for drybulk and container vessels, respectively, from the date the vessel was originally delivered from
	the shipyard. Intangible assets are amortized over the contract periods, which range from one to ten years.

	2014 and the write-off of the Navios Melodia favorable lease in the second quarter of 2013 of $3.2 million. Depreciation of vessels is calculated using an estimated useful life of 25 and 30&nbsp;years for drybulk and container vessels, respectively,

	also requires compliance with certain financial covenants. Among other events, it will be an event of default under this credit facility if the financial covenants are not complied with.

	In addition to
	distributions on our units, our primary short-term liquidity needs are to fund general working capital requirements, cash reserve requirements including those under our credit facilities and debt service, while our long-term liquidity needs
	primarily relate to expansion and investment capital expenditures and other maintenance capital expenditures and debt repayment. Expansion capital expenditures are primarily for the purchase or construction of vessels to the extent the expenditures
	increase the operating capacity of or revenue generated by our fleet, while maintenance capital expenditures primarily consist of drydocking expenditures and expenditures to replace vessels in order to maintain the operating capacity of or revenue
	generated by our fleet. Investment capital expenditures are those capital expenditures that are neither maintenance capital expenditures nor expansion capital expenditures.

	borrowings. As of December 31, 2015, Navios Partners&#146; current assets totaled $39.8 million, while current liabilities totaled $41.5 million, resulting in a negative working capital position of $1.7 million. Generally, our long-term sources of
	funds derive from cash from operations, long-term bank borrowings and other debt or equity financings to fund acquisitions and expansion and investment capital expenditures, including opportunities we may pursue under the Omnibus Agreement. We
	cannot assure you that we will be able to raise the size of our credit facilities or obtaining additional funds on favorable terms.

	The amount for estimated replacement capital expenditures

	a&nbsp;30-year useful life for container vessels; and (iii)&nbsp;a relative net investment rate.

	The amount for estimated maintenance capital

	Our Board of Directors, with the approval of the conflicts committee, may determine that one or more of our assumptions should be

	prevailing market conditions, charter hire rates and the availability and cost of financing at the time of replacement. We may elect to finance some or all of our maintenance and replacement capital expenditures through the issuance of additional

	Although we do not currently have in place any other agreements relating to acquisitions of other vessels, we assess potential acquisition opportunities on a

	years upon their expiration of their current charters or upon completion of their construction. Subject to the terms of our loan agreements, we could elect to fund any future acquisitions with equity or debt or cash on hand or a combination of these
	forms of consideration. Any debt incurred for this purpose could make us more leveraged and increase our debt service obligations or could subject us to additional operational or financial restrictive covenants.

	particular asset may not be fully recoverable. In accordance with accounting for the &#147;impairment or disposal of long-lived assets&#148;, Navios Partners&#146; management evaluates the
	carrying amounts and periods over which long-lived assets are depreciated to determine if events or changes in circumstances have occurred that would require modification to their carrying values or useful lives. In evaluating useful lives and
	carrying values of long-lived assets, certain indicators of potential impairment, are reviewed such as undiscounted projected operating cash flows, vessel sales and purchases, business plans and overall market conditions.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Undiscounted projected net operating cash flows are determined for each vessel and compared to the vessel carrying value of the vessel and related carrying
	value of the intangible with respect to the time charter agreement attached to that vessel. Within the shipping industry, vessels are customarily bought and sold with a charter attached. The value of the charter may be favorable or unfavorable when
	comparing the charter rate to then current market rates. The loss recognized either on impairment (or on disposition) will reflect the excess of carrying value over fair value (selling price) for the vessel asset group.

	During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015, management concluded that events occurred and circumstances had changed, which indicated that potential impairment
	of Navios Partners&#146; long-lived assets may exist. These indicators included continued deterioration in the spot market, and the related, impact of the current drybulk and container sector has on management&#146;s expectation for future revenues.
	As a result, an impairment assessment of long-lived assets was performed.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Navios Partners determined undiscounted projected net operating cash flows for
	each vessel and compared it to the vessel&#146;s carrying value together with the carrying value of deferred drydock and special survey costs related to the vessel and the carrying value of the related intangible. The significant factors and
	assumptions used in the undiscounted projected net operating cash flow analysis included: determining the projected net operating cash flows by considering the charter revenues from existing time charters for the fixed fleet days (Navios
	Partners&#146; remaining charter agreement rates) and an estimated daily time charter equivalent for the unfixed days (based on a combination of the Navios Partners&#146; remaining charter agreement rates and the 10-year average historical one year
	time charter rates adjusted for outliers) over the remaining economic life of each vessel, net of brokerage and address commissions and excluding days of scheduled off-hires, management fees fixed until December 2015 and thereafter assuming an
	annual increase of 3.0% and utilization rate of 98.6% based on the fleet&#146;s historical performance. The assessment concluded that step two of the impairment analysis was not required and no impairment of vessels and the intangible assets existed
	as of December&nbsp;31, 2015, as the undiscounted projected net operating cash flows exceeded the carrying value.

	In connection with its annual
	impairment testing on its vessels as of December&nbsp;31, 2015, the Company performs sensitivity analysis on the most sensitive and/or subjective assumptions that have the potential to affect the outcome of the test, principally the projected
	charter rate used to forecast future cash flows for unfixed days. In that regard, there would continue to be no impairment required to be recognized on any of the Company&#146;s vessels when assuming a decline in the 10-year average (of the one-year
	charter rate for similar vessels), which is the rate that the Company uses to forecast future cash flows for unfixed days, ranging from 13.17% to 90.73% (depending on the vessel).

	As disclosed elsewhere, the Company&#146;s fleet includes 28 vessels for which the carrying value (including the carrying value of the time charter, if any,
	on the specified vessel) exceeds the estimated fair value of those same vessels (including the estimated fair value of the time charter, if any, on the specified vessel) by approximately $319.5 million in the aggregate (the unrealized loss). If
	testing for impairment using current rates for five-year, three-year and one-year charters historical average (of the one-year charter rate for similar vessels) in lieu of the ten-year historical average (of the one-year charter rate for similar
	vessels), Navios Partners estimates that an additional one, five and one of its vessels, respectively, would have carrying values in excess of their projected undiscounted future cash flows.

	As of December&nbsp;31, 2015, the 10-year historical average rates for its vessels (which naturally varies by type of vessel) used in determining future cash
	flows for purposes of its impairment analysis were less than 5% higher than the Company&#146;s average daily time charter equivalent rate achieved in fiscal year 2015 of $19,739 per day.

	In the event that impairment would occur, the fair value of the related asset would be determined and an impairment charge would be recorded to operations
	calculated by comparing the asset&#146;s carrying value to its fair value. Fair value is estimated primarily through the use of third-party valuations performed on an individual vessel basis.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Although management believes the underlying assumptions supporting this assessment are reasonable, if charter rate trends and the length of the current market
	downturn vary significantly from our forecasts, management may be required to perform step two of the impairment analysis in the future that could expose Navios Partners to material impairment charges in the future.

	Depreciation is computed using the straight line method over the useful life of the vessels, after considering

	shipping industry. Management estimates the useful life of our vessels to be 25 and 30&nbsp;years from the drybulk and container vessel&#146;s original construction, respectively. However, when regulations place limitations over the ability of a
	vessel to trade on a worldwide basis, its useful life is re-estimated to end at the date such regulations become effective.

	Voyage revenues for the transportation of cargo are recognized ratably over the estimated relative transit time of each voyage. Voyage expenses are recognized
	as incurred. A voyage is deemed to commence when a vessel is available for loading and is deemed to end upon the completion of the discharge of the current cargo. Estimated losses on voyages are provided for in full at the time such losses become
	evident. Under a voyage charter, a vessel is provided for the transportation of specific goods between specific ports in return for payment of an agreed upon freight per ton of cargo.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Revenues from time chartering of vessels are accounted for as operating leases and are thus recognized on a straight line basis as the average minimum lease
	revenue over the rental periods of such charter agreements, as service is performed. A time charter involves placing a vessel at the charterers&#146; disposal for a period of time during which the charterer uses the vessel in return for the payment
	of a specified daily hire rate. Under time charters, operating costs such as for crews, maintenance and insurance are typically paid by the owner of the vessel.

	Revenues are recorded net of address commissions. Address commissions represent a

	received in exchange for the consideration provided to the charterer, these commissions are presented as a reduction of revenue.

	In February 2015, the FASB issued the ASU 2015-02, &#147;Consolidation (Topic 810)&#151;Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis&#148;,
	which amends the criteria for determining which entities are considered VIEs, amends the criteria for determining if a service provider possesses a variable interest in a VIE and ends the deferral granted to investment companies for application of
	the VIE consolidation model. The ASU is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December&nbsp;15, 2015. Early application is permitted. We do not expect the adoption of this ASU to have a material impact on the Company&#146;s
	results of operations, financial position or cash flows, except if Navios Partners were to enter into new arrangements in 2015 that fall into the scope prior to adoption of this standard.

	In January 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-01, Income Statement Extraordinary and Unusual Items. This standard eliminates the concept of extraordinary and
	unusual items from U.S. GAAP. The new standard is effective for annual and interim periods after December&nbsp;15, 2015. Early adoption is permitted. Navios Partners plans to adopt this standard effective January&nbsp;1, 2016. The adoption of the

	the FASB issued ASU No.&nbsp;2014-15, Presentation of Financial Statements-Going Concern (Subtopic 205-40): Disclosure of Uncertainties About an Entity&#146;s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern. This standard requires management to assess an
	entity&#146;s ability to continue as a going concern, and to provide related footnote disclosures in certain circumstances. Before this new standard, no accounting guidance existed for management on when and how to assess or disclose going concern
	uncertainties. The amendments are effective for annual periods ending after December&nbsp;15, 2016, and interim periods within annual periods beginning after December&nbsp;15, 2016. Early application is permitted. We plan to adopt this standard

	In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, clarifying the method used to determine the timing and requirements for
	revenue recognition on the statements of income. Under the new standard, an entity must identify the performance obligations in a contract, the transaction price and allocate the price to specific performance obligations to recognize the revenue
	when the obligation is completed. The amendments in this update also require disclosure of sufficient information to allow users to understand the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flow arising from contracts. The new

	In April 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-08, Presentation of Financial Statements and Property, Plant and Equipment changing the presentation of discontinued
	operations on the statements of income and other requirements for reporting discontinued operations. Under the new standard, a disposal of a component or a group of components of an entity is required to be reported in discontinued operations if the
	disposal represents a strategic shift that has (or will have) a major effect on an entity&#146;s operations and financial results when the component meets the criteria to be classified as held-for-sale or is disposed. The amendments in this update
	also require additional disclosures about discontinued operations and disposal of an individually significant component of an entity that does not qualify for discontinued operations. The new accounting guidance is effective for interim and annual
	periods beginning after December&nbsp;15, 2014. The adoption of the new standard is not expected to have a material impact on Navios Partners&#146; results of operations, financial position or cash flows.

	While the amount of time each of them allocate between our business and the business of Navios Holdings, Navios Acquisition and Navios Midstream varies from time to time depending on various circumstances and the respective needs of the business,

	Although we have suspended payments of our quarterly cash distributions, the following description of our incentive distribution rights reflects such rights in
	the event the distributions are reinstated and the indicated levels are achieved, of which there can be no assurance. Incentive distribution rights represent the right to receive an increasing percentage of quarterly distributions of available cash
	from Operating Surplus after the minimum quarterly distribution and the target distribution levels have been achieved. Our general partner currently holds the incentive distribution rights, but may transfer these rights separately from its general
	partner interest, subject to restrictions in the partnership agreement. Except for transfers of incentive distribution rights to an affiliate or another entity as part of our general partner&#146;s merger or consolidation with or into, or sale of
	substantially all of its assets to such entity, the approval of a majority of our common units (excluding common units held by our general partner and its affiliates), voting separately as a class, generally is required for a transfer of the

	The following table illustrates the percentage allocations of the
	additional available cash from Operating Surplus among the unitholders and our general partner up to the various target distribution levels. The amounts set forth under &#147;Marginal Percentage Interest in Distributions&#148; are the percentage
	interests of the unitholders and our general partner in any available cash from Operating Surplus we distribute up to and including the corresponding amount in the column &#147;Total Quarterly Distribution Target Amount,&#148; until available cash
	from Operating Surplus we distribute reaches the next target distribution level, if any. The percentage interests shown for the unitholders and our general partner for the minimum quarterly distribution are also applicable to quarterly distribution
	amounts that are less than the minimum quarterly distribution. The percentage interests shown for our general partner assume that our general partner maintains its 2.0% general partner interest and assume our general partner has not transferred the

	Based on our current and projected methods of operations, and an opinion of counsel, we believe that we will not be a PFIC with respect to any taxable year.
	Our U.S. counsel, Thompson Hine LLP, is of the opinion that (1)&nbsp;the income we receive from the time chartering activities and assets engaged in generating such income should not be treated as passive income or assets, respectively, and
	(2)&nbsp;so long as our income from time charters exceeds 25.0% of our gross income for each taxable year after our initial taxable year and the value of our vessels contracted under time charters exceeds 50.0% of the average value of our assets for
	each taxable year after our initial taxable year, we should not be a PFIC. This opinion is based on representations and projections provided to our counsel by us regarding our assets, income and charters, and its validity is conditioned on the
	accuracy of such representations and projections.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Our counsel&#146;s opinion is based principally on their conclusion that, for purposes of determining
	whether we are a PFIC, the gross income we derive or are deemed to derive from the time chartering activities of our wholly-owned subsidiaries should constitute services income, rather than rental income. Correspondingly, such income should not
	constitute passive income, and the assets that we or our subsidiaries own and operate in connection with the production of such income, in particular, the vessels we or our subsidiaries own that are subject to time charters, should not constitute
	passive assets for purposes of determining whether we are or have been a PFIC. We expect that all of the vessels in our fleet will be engaged in time chartering activities and intend to treat our income from those activities as non-passive income,
	and the vessels engaged in those activities as non-passive assets, for PFIC purposes.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Our counsel has advised us that there is a significant amount of
	legal authority consisting of the Code, legislative history, IRS pronouncements and rulings supporting our position that the income from our time chartering activities constitutes services income (rather than rental income). There is, however, no
	direct legal authority under the PFIC rules addressing whether income from time chartering activities is services income or rental income. Moreover, in a case not interpreting the PFIC rules,
<I>
	Tidewater Inc. v. United States
</I>
	, 565 F.3d 299 (5th
	Cir. 2009), the Fifth Circuit held that the vessel time charters at issue generated predominantly rental income rather than services income. However, the IRS stated in an Action on Decision (AOD 2010-001) that it disagrees with, and will not
	acquiesce to, the way that the rental versus services framework was applied to the facts in the
<I>
	Tidewater
</I>
	decision, and in its discussion stated that the time charters at issue in
<I>
	Tidewater
</I>
	would be treated as producing services income
	for PFIC purposes. The IRS&#146;s AOD, however, is an administrative action that cannot be relied upon or otherwise cited as precedent by taxpayers.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The
	opinion of our counsel is not binding on the IRS or any court. Thus, while we have received an opinion of our counsel in support of our position, there is a possibility that the IRS or a court could disagree with this position and the opinion of our
	counsel. In addition, although we intend to conduct our affairs in a manner to avoid being classified as a PFIC with respect to any taxable year, we cannot assure you that the nature of our operations will not change in the future.

	As discussed more fully below, if we were to be treated as a PFIC for any taxable year in which a U.S. Holder
	owned our common units, the U.S.&nbsp;Holder would be subject to different taxation rules depending on whether the U.S.&nbsp;Holder makes an election to treat us as a &#147;Qualified Electing Fund,&#148; which we refer to as a &#147;QEF
	election.&#148; As an alternative to making a QEF election, the U.S.&nbsp;Holder may be able to make a &#147;mark-to-market&#148; election with respect to our common units, as discussed below. In addition, if we were treated as a PFIC for any
	taxable year in which a U.S. Holder owned our common units, the U.S. Holder generally would be required to file IRS Form 8621 with the U.S. Holder&#146;s U.S. federal income tax return for each year to report the U.S. Holder&#146;s ownership of such
	common units. In the event a U.S. Holder does not file IRS Form 8621, the statute of limitations on the assessment and collection of U.S. federal income taxes of such U.S. Holder for the related tax year will not close before the date which is three

	If we were to be treated as a PFIC for any taxable year and a U.S.&nbsp;Holder makes a timely QEF election (any such U.S. Holder, an &#147;Electing

	regardless of whether or not the Electing Holder received any distributions from us in that year. Such income inclusions would not be eligible for the preferential tax rates applicable to &#147;qualified dividend income.&#148; The Electing
	Holder&#146;s adjusted tax basis in our common units will be increased to reflect taxed but undistributed earnings and profits. Distributions to the Electing Holder of our earnings and profits that were previously taxed will result in a
	corresponding reduction in the Electing Holder&#146;s adjusted tax basis in our common units and will not be taxed again once distributed. The Electing Holder would not, however, be entitled to a deduction for its pro rata share of any losses that
	we incur with respect to any year. An Electing Holder generally will recognize capital gain or loss on the sale, exchange or other disposition of our common units.

	Our functional and reporting
	currency is the U.S. dollar. We engage in worldwide commerce with a variety of entities. Although our operations may expose us to certain levels of foreign currency risk, our transactions are predominantly U.S. dollar denominated. Transactions in
	currencies other than U.S. dollar are translated at the exchange rate in effect at the date of each transaction. Differences in exchange rates during the period between the date a transaction denominated in a foreign currency is consummated and the
	date on which it is either settled or translated, are recognized. Expenses incurred in foreign currencies against which the U.S.&nbsp;Dollar falls in value can increase thereby decreasing our income or vice versa if the U.S. dollar increases in
	value. For example, during the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2015, the value of U.S. dollar increased by approximately 10.8% as compared to the Euro.

	Borrowings under our credit

	our outstanding debt at a weighted average interest rate of 4.4%, 4.7% and 3.7%, respectively. A 1% increase in LIBOR would have increased our interest expense for the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, by $6.1&nbsp;million,
	$5.6&nbsp;million and $3.5 million, respectively.

<B>
	To the Board of Directors and Partners of Navios Maritime Partners L.P.:
</B>
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and the related consolidated statements of income, changes in partners&#146; capital and cash
	flows present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Navios Maritime Partners L.P. and its subsidiaries (the &#147;Company&#148;) at December&nbsp;31, 2015 and 2014, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for
	each of the three years in the period ended December&nbsp;31, 2015 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal
	control over financial reporting as of December&nbsp;31, 2015, based on criteria established in
<I>
	Internal Control
</I>
	&#151;
<I>
	Integrated Framework (2013)
</I>
	&nbsp;issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
	(COSO). The Company&#146;s management is responsible for these financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting,
	included in &#147;Management&#146;s annual report on internal control over financial reporting&#148;, appearing in Item&nbsp;15(b) of the Company&#146;s 2015 Annual Report on Form&nbsp;20-F. Our responsibility is to express opinions on these
	financial statements and on the Company&#146;s internal control over financial reporting based on our integrated audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
	standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all
	material respects. Our audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
	management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material
	weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe
	that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	A company&#146;s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide
	reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company&#146;s internal control over financial
	reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i)&nbsp;pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii)&nbsp;provide
	reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in
	accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii)&nbsp;provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company&#146;s assets that could
	have a material effect on the financial statements.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or
	detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or
	procedures may deteriorate.

	Change in Accounting Principle:
</B>
	The Company historically presented deferred debt issuance costs, or fees related to directly issuing
	debt, as long-term assets on the consolidated balance sheets. During the first quarter of 2015, the Company adopted guidance codified in ASU 2015-03 Interest-Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30), Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance
	Costs. The guidance simplifies the presentation of debt issuance costs by requiring debt issuance costs to be presented as a deduction from the corresponding liability, consistent with debt discounts. The recognition and measurement guidance for
	debt issuance costs is not affected. Therefore, these costs will continue to be amortized as interest expense using the effective interest method pursuant to ASC 835-30-35-2 through 35-3. Upon adoption, the Company applied the new guidance
	retrospectively to all prior periods presented in the financial statements. The Company elected to early adopt the requirements of ASU 2015-03 effective beginning the first quarter ending March&nbsp;31, 2015 and applied this guidance retrospectively
	to all prior periods presented in the Company&#146;s financial statements.

	Impairment of long lived assets:
</B>
	&nbsp;Vessels, other fixed assets and other long lived assets held and used by Navios Partners are reviewed periodically for potential impairment whenever events or changes in
	circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a particular asset may not be fully recoverable. In accordance with accounting for the &#147;impairment or disposal of long-lived assets&#148;, Navios Partners&#146; management evaluates the
	carrying amounts and periods over which long-lived assets are depreciated to determine if events or changes in circumstances have occurred that would require modification to their carrying values or useful lives. In evaluating useful lives and
	carrying values of long-lived assets, certain indicators of potential impairment, are reviewed such as undiscounted projected operating cash flows, vessel sales and purchases, business plans and overall market conditions.

	Undiscounted projected net operating cash flows are determined for each vessel and compared to the vessel carrying value of the vessel and related carrying
	value of the intangible with respect to the time charter agreement attached to that vessel. Within the shipping industry, vessels are customarily bought and sold with a charter attached. The value of the charter may be favorable or unfavorable when
	comparing the charter rate to then current market rates. The loss recognized either on impairment (or on disposition) will reflect the excess of carrying value over fair value (selling price) for the vessel asset group.

	During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015, management concluded that events occurred and circumstances had changed, which indicated that potential impairment
	of Navios Partners&#146; long-lived assets may exist. These indicators included continued deterioration in the spot market, and the related impact of the current drybulk and container sector has on management&#146;s expectation for future revenues.

	determining the projected net operating cash flows by considering the charter revenues from existing time charters for the fixed fleet days (Navios Partners&#146; remaining charter agreement rates) and an estimated daily time charter equivalent for
	the unfixed days (based on a combination of the Navios Partners&#146; remaining charter agreement rates and the 10-year average historical one year time charter rates adjusted for outliers) over the remaining economic life of each vessel, net of

	Intangible assets and liabilities:
</B>
	&nbsp;Navios Partners&#146; intangible assets and liabilities consist of favorable lease terms and unfavorable lease terms. When intangible assets or liabilities associated with
	the acquisition of a vessel are identified, they are recorded at fair value. Fair value is determined by reference to market data and the discounted amount of expected future cash flows. Where charter rates are higher than market charter rates, an
	asset is recorded, being the difference between the acquired charter rate and the market charter rate for an equivalent vessel. Where charter rates are less than market charter rates, a liability is recorded, being the difference between the assumed
	charter rate and the market charter rate for an equivalent vessel. The determination of the fair value of acquired assets and assumed liabilities requires Navios Partners to make significant assumptions and estimates of many variables including
	market charter rates, expected future charter rates, the level of utilization of its vessels and its weighted average cost of capital. The use of different assumptions could result in a material change in the fair value of these items, which could
	have a material impact on Navios Partners&#146; financial position and results of operations.

	of a specified daily hire rate. Under time charters, operating costs such as for crews, maintenance and insurance are typically paid by the owner of the vessel.

</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	In February 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No.&nbsp;2016-02, &#147;Leases (Topic 842)&#148; (&#147;ASU&nbsp;2016-02&#148;). ASU 2016-02 will
	apply to both types of leases &#150; capital (or finance) leases and operating leases. According to the new Accounting Standard, lessees will be required to recognize assets and liabilities on the balance sheet for the rights and obligations created
	by all leases with terms of more than 12 months. ASU&nbsp;2016 &#150; 02 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December&nbsp;15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early application is permitted. The Company is
	currently assessing the impact that adopting this new accounting guidance will have on its consolidated financial statements and footnotes disclosures.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	In February 2015, the FASB issued the ASU 2015-02, &#147;Consolidation (Topic 810)&#151;Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis&#148;, which amends the
	criteria for determining which entities are considered VIEs, amends the criteria for determining if a service provider possesses a variable interest in a VIE and ends the deferral granted to investment companies for application of the VIE
	consolidation model. The ASU is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December&nbsp;15, 2015. Early application is permitted. We do not expect the adoption of this ASU to have a material impact on the Company&#146;s results of
	operations, financial position or cash flows, except if Navios Partners were to enter into new arrangements in 2015 that fall into the scope prior to adoption of this standard.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	In January 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-01, Income Statement Extraordinary and Unusual Items. This standard eliminates the concept of extraordinary and
	unusual items from U.S. GAAP. The new standard is effective for annual and interim periods after December&nbsp;15, 2015. Early adoption is permitted. Navios Partners adopted this standard with effect as of January&nbsp;1, 2016. The adoption of the
	new standard is not expected to have a material impact on Navios Partners&#146; results of operations, financial position or cash flows.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	In August 2014,
	the FASB issued ASU No.&nbsp;2014-15, Presentation of Financial Statements-Going Concern (Subtopic 205-40): Disclosure of Uncertainties About an Entity&#146;s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern. This standard requires management to assess an
	entity&#146;s ability to continue as a going concern, and to provide related footnote disclosures in certain circumstances. Before this new standard, no accounting guidance existed for management on when and how to assess or disclose going concern
	uncertainties. The amendments are effective for annual periods ending after December&nbsp;15, 2016, and interim periods within annual periods beginning after December&nbsp;15, 2016. Early application is permitted. We plan to adopt this standard
	effective January&nbsp;1, 2017. The adoption of the new standard is not expected to have a material impact on Navios Partners&#146; results of operations, financial position or cash flows.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	In May 2014, The FASB issued ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, clarifying the method used to determine the timing and requirements for
	revenue recognition on the statements of income. Under the new standard, an entity must identify the performance obligations in a contract, the transaction price and allocate the price to specific performance obligations to recognize the revenue
	when the obligation is completed. The amendments in this update also require disclosure of sufficient information to allow users to understand the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flow arising from contracts. The new
	accounting guidance is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December&nbsp;15, 2016. Early adoption is not permitted. We are currently reviewing the effect of ASU No.&nbsp;2014-09 on our revenue recognition.

	In April 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-08, Presentation of Financial Statements and Property, Plant and
	Equipment changing the presentation of discontinued operations on the statements of income and other requirements for reporting discontinued operations. Under the new standard, a disposal of a component or a group of components of an entity is
	required to be reported in discontinued operations if the disposal represents a strategic shift that has (or will have) a major effect on an entity&#146;s operations and financial results when the component meets the criteria to be classified as
	held-for-sale or is disposed. The amendments in this update also require additional disclosures about discontinued operations and disposal of an individually significant component of an entity that does not qualify for discontinued operations. The
	new accounting guidance is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December&nbsp;15, 2014. The adoption of the new standard is not expected to have a material impact on Navios Partners&#146; results of operations, financial position
	or cash flows.

	To date, for each of the vessels purchased from Navios Holdings, the vessel acquisition was effected through the acquisition
	of all of the capital stock of the vessel-owning companies, which held the ownership and other contractual rights and obligations related to each of the acquired vessels, including the vessel and a charter-out contract. Management accounted for each
	acquisition as an asset acquisition. At the transaction date, the purchase price approximated the fair value of the assets acquired, which was determined based on a combination of methodologies including discounted cash flow analyses and independent
	valuation analyses. The consideration paid, for each of these transactions, was allocated between the intangible assets (favorable lease term) and the vessel value.

	Marshall Islands, Malta and Liberia do not impose a tax on international shipping income. Under the laws of Marshall Islands, Malta and Liberia, the countries
	of the vessel-owning subsidiaries&#146; incorporation and vessels&#146; registration, the vessel-owning subsidiaries are subject to registration and tonnage taxes which have been included in vessel operating expenses in the accompanying consolidated

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	In accordance with the currently applicable Greek law, foreign flagged vessels that are managed by Greek or foreign ship management
	companies having established an office in Greece are subject to duties towards the Greek state which are calculated on the basis of the relevant vessel&#146;s tonnage.&nbsp;The payment of said duties exhausts the tax liability of the foreign ship
	owning company and the relevant manager against any tax, duty, charge or contribution payable on income from the exploitation of the foreign flagged vessel.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Pursuant to Section&nbsp;883 of the Internal Revenue Code of the United States, U.S.&nbsp;source income from the international operation of ships is generally
	exempt from U.S.&nbsp;income tax if the company operating the ships meets certain incorporation and ownership requirements. Among other things, in order to qualify for this exemption, the company operating the ships must be incorporated in a country
	which grants an equivalent exemption from income taxes to U.S.&nbsp;corporations. All the vessel-owning subsidiaries satisfy these initial criteria.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	In
	addition, these companies must meet an ownership test. The management of Navios Partners believes that this ownership test was satisfied prior to the IPO by virtue of a special rule applicable to situations where the ship operating companies are
	beneficially owned by a publicly traded company. Although not free from doubt, management also believes that the ownership test will be satisfied based on the trading volume and ownership of Navios Partners&#146; units, but no assurance can be given

	Navios Partners calculates earnings per unit by allocating
	reported net income for each period to each class of units based on the distribution waterfall for available cash specified in Navios Partners&#146; partnership agreement, net of the unallocated earnings (or losses). Basic earnings net income per
	unit is determined by dividing net income by the weighted average number of units outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per unit is calculated in the same manner as net income per unit, except that the weighted average number of
	outstanding units increased to include the dilutive effect of outstanding unit options or phantom units. Net loss per unit undistributed is determined by taking the distributions in excess of net income and allocating between common units and
	general partner units on a 98%-2% basis. There were no options or phantom units outstanding during the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2015, 2014 and 2013.
