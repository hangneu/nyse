	the operations of, manage and determine the strategies and policies of the Partnership. During the period from our IPO until the time of our first annual meeting of unitholders on June&nbsp;25, 2013, our general partner retained the sole power to
	appoint, remove and replace all members of our board of directors. At our first annual meeting of unitholders, four of the seven board members became electable by the common unitholders and accordingly, from this date, KNOT, as the owner of our
	general partner, no longer retained the power to control our board of directors and hence us. As a result, we are no longer considered to be under common control with KNOT, and, as a consequence, we no longer account for any vessel acquisitions from
	KNOT after June&nbsp;25, 2013 as a transfer of equity interests between entities under common control.

	EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA
</I>
	. EBITDA is defined as earnings before interest, depreciation and taxes. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as
	earnings before interest, depreciation, taxes, goodwill impairment charges and other financial items (including other finance expense, realized and unrealized gain (loss) on derivative instruments and net loss on foreign currency transactions).
	EBITDA is used as a supplemental financial measure by management and external users of financial statements, such as our lenders, to assess our financial and operating performance and our compliance with the financial covenants and restrictions
	contained in our financing agreements. Adjusted EBITDA is used as a supplemental financial measure by management and external users of financial statements, such as investors, to assess our financial and operating performance. We believe that
	Adjusted EBITDA assists our management and investors by increasing the comparability of our performance from period to period and against the performance of other companies in our industry that provide Adjusted EBITDA information. This increased
	comparability is achieved by excluding the potentially disparate effects between periods or companies of interest, other financial items, goodwill impairment charges, depreciation and taxes, which items are affected by various and possibly changing
	financing methods, capital structure and historical cost basis and which items may significantly affect net income between periods. We believe that including Adjusted EBITDA as a financial and operating measure benefits investors in
	(1)&nbsp;selecting between investing in us and other investment alternatives and (2)&nbsp;monitoring our ongoing financial and operational strength in assessing whether to continue to hold common units.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered alternatives to net income, operating income, cash flow from operating activities or any
	other measure of financial performance presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (&#147;U.S. GAAP&#148;). EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA exclude some, but not all, items that affect net income, and these
	measures may vary among other companies. Therefore, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA as presented below may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. The following tables reconcile EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA to net cash provided
	by operating activities and net income, the most directly comparable financial measures presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP, for the periods presented.

	Our partnership agreement requires our board of directors to deduct

	than actual maintenance and replacement capital expenditures, the amount of cash available for distribution to unitholders may be lower than if actual maintenance and replacement capital expenditures were deducted from operating surplus. If our

	We depend on our customers&#146; willingness and ability to fund operating and capital expenditures to provide crude oil shuttle tankers for
	new or expanding offshore projects. Existing and future adverse economic conditions, including current low oil prices, may lead to a decline in our customers&#146; operations or ability to pay for our services, which could result in decreased demand
	for our vessels. There has historically been a strong link between the development of the world economy and demand for energy, including oil and natural gas.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Global financial markets and economic conditions have been severely disrupted and volatile in recent years and remain subject to significant
	vulnerabilities, such as the deterioration of fiscal balances and the rapid accumulation of public debt, continued deleveraging in the banking sector and a limited supply of credit. Credit markets as well as the equity and debt capital markets were
	exceedingly distressed during 2008 and 2009 and have been volatile since that time. Uncertainty surrounding the continuing sovereign debt crisis in Greece and other European Union member countries and turmoil and unrest in the Middle East, Africa,
	Korea, the Ukraine and elsewhere, have led to increased volatility in global credit and equity markets. An extended period of adverse development in the outlook for European countries or Brazil could reduce the overall demand for oil and have a
	negative impact on our customers. Potential developments, or market perceptions concerning these and related issues, could affect our business, financial position, results of operations and ability to make cash distributions to our unitholders.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Any global financial or credit crisis or disruption may further reduce the availability of liquidity and credit to fund the continuation and
	expansion of industrial business operations worldwide. Shortage of liquidity and credit combined with uncertainty in worldwide equity markets could lead to an extended worldwide economic recession. Such deterioration of the worldwide economy could
	result in reduced demand for oil and natural gas, exploration and production activity and transportation of oil and natural gas that could lead to a decrease in the hire rate earned by our vessels and a decrease in new charter activity. In addition,
	any adverse development in the global financial markets or deterioration in economic conditions might adversely impact our ability to issue additional equity at prices that will not be dilutive to our existing unitholders or preclude us from issuing
	equity at all.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	We also cannot be certain that additional financing will be available if needed and to the extent required, on acceptable
	terms or at all. As a result of the disruptions in the credit markets and higher capital requirements, many lenders have increased margins on lending rates, enacted tighter lending standards, required more restrictive terms (including higher
	collateral ratios for advances, shorter maturities and smaller loan amounts), or have refused to refinance existing debt at all. Furthermore, certain banks that have historically been significant lenders to the shipping industry have reduced or
	ceased lending activities in the shipping industry. If additional financing is not available when needed, or is available only on unfavorable terms, we may be unable to meet our obligations as they come due or we may be unable to expand our existing
	business, complete shuttle tanker acquisitions or otherwise take advantage of business opportunities as they arise.

	Furthermore, any
	uncertainty in the financial markets could have an impact on our customers and/or suppliers including, among other things, causing them to fail to meet their obligations to us. Similarly, any shortage of credit could affect lenders participating in
	our financing agreements, making them unable to fulfill their commitments and obligations to us. Any reductions in activity owing to such conditions or failure by our customers, suppliers or lenders to meet their contractual obligations to us could
	adversely affect our business, financial position, results of operation and ability to make cash distributions to our unitholders.

	Further, if we determine at any time that a

	For example, during the three months ended June&nbsp;30, 2015, we concluded that indicators of impairment were present due to a significant reduction in the price of our common units. Consequently, we performed an interim vessel and goodwill
	impairment analysis as of June&nbsp;30, 2015 on our fleet, and concluded that although there was no impairment to the vessels&#146; values, the carrying value of goodwill exceeded its fair value, and a goodwill impairment charge of $6.2 million was

	Due to concern over the risk of climate change, a number of countries and the International Maritime Organization (the &#147;IMO&#148;) have

	subsequently reaffirmed its strong commitment to continue to work to address greenhouse gas emissions from ships engaged in international trade. Compliance with changes in laws, regulations and obligations relating to climate change could increase

	could exceed the insurance, and any uninsured or underinsured loss could harm our business, financial condition, results of operations and ability to make cash distributions to our unitholders. In addition, the insurance may be voidable by the

	expanded. In 2012 the U.S. signed into law the Iran Threat Reduction and Syria Human Rights Act of 2012 (&#147;TRA&#148;), which placed further restrictions on the ability of non-U.S. companies to do business or trade with Iran and Syria. A major
	provision in the TRA is that issuers of securities must disclose to the SEC in their annual and quarterly reports filed after February&nbsp;6, 2013 if the issuer or &#147;any affiliate&#148; has &#147;knowingly&#148; engaged in certain activities
	involving Iran during the timeframe covered by the report. This disclosure obligation is broad in scope in that it requires the reporting of activity that would not be considered a violation of U.S. sanctions as well as violative conduct, and is not
	subject to a materiality threshold. The SEC publishes these disclosures on its website and the President of the United States must initiate an investigation in response to all disclosures. It should be noted that the U.S. and various other nations
	entered into a Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) with Iran that provides for phased sanctions relief. On January&nbsp;16, 2016, following verification that Iran had satisfied its commitments under the JCPOA, the U.S. lifted its
	nuclear-related &#147;secondary&#148; sanctions and the European Union also took action to lift its sanctions. As a result of sanctions relief, non-U.S. persons will be able to engage in business with Iran. Sanctions relief will not impact the SEC
	reporting requirements discussed above.

	In addition to the sanctions against Iran, the U.S. also has sanctions that target other
	countries, entities and individuals. These sanctions have certain extraterritorial effects that need to be considered by non-U.S. companies. It should also be noted that other governments have implemented versions of U.S. sanctions. We believe that
	we are in compliance with all applicable sanctions and embargo laws and regulations imposed by the U.S., the United Nations or European Union countries and intend to maintain such compliance. However, there can be no assurance that we will be in
	compliance in the future, particularly as the scope of certain laws may be unclear and may be subject to changing interpretations. Any such violation could result in fines or other penalties and could result in some investors deciding, or being
	required, to divest their interest, or not to invest, in our common units. Additionally, some investors may decide to divest their interest, or not to invest, in our common units simply because we may do business with companies that do business in
	sanctioned countries. Investor perception of the value of our common units may also be adversely affected by the consequences of war, the effects of terrorism, civil unrest and governmental actions in these and surrounding countries.

	the Norwegian Criminal Code of 1902. Any such violation could result in substantial fines, sanctions, civil and/or criminal penalties, curtailment of operations in certain jurisdictions, and might adversely affect our business, results of operations
	or financial condition. In addition, actual or alleged violations could damage our reputation and ability to do business. Furthermore, detecting, investigating, and resolving actual or alleged violations is expensive and could consume significant

	Our partnership agreement further restricts unitholders&#146; voting rights by

	group in excess of 4.9% may not be voted on any matter and are not considered to be outstanding when sending notices of a meeting of unitholders, calculating required votes (except for purposes of nominating a person for election to our board of

	corporations. In that case, the Fifth Circuit did not address the definition of passive income or the PFIC rules; however, the reasoning of the case could have implications as to how the income from a time charter would be classified under such
	rules. If the reasoning of this case were extended to the PFIC context, the gross income we derive or are deemed to derive from our time-chartering activities may be treated as rental income, and we would likely be treated as a PFIC. In published

	We were formed to own and operate shuttle tankers under long-term charters. Our primary business objective is to increase quarterly
	distributions per unit over time by growing our business through accretive acquisitions of shuttle tankers and by chartering our vessels pursuant to long-term charters with high quality customers that generate long-term stable cash flows. All of the
	vessels in our current fleet are chartered to Statoil, Transpetro, Repsol, BG Group, ExxonMobil and ENI under long-term charters. Our charters have an average remaining term of 5.6 years as of December&nbsp;31, 2015 (including guaranteed option
	periods). Since our IPO, we have increased our quarterly distribution from $0.375 per unit to $0.52 per unit for the quarter ended December&nbsp;31, 2015.

	pursue potential growth opportunities and to attract and retain high-quality, creditworthy customers. As of March&nbsp;18, 2016, KNOT owned our general partner interest, all of our incentive distribution rights and a 31.2% limited partner interest
	in us. KNOT intends to utilize us as its primary growth vehicle to pursue the acquisition of long-term, stable cash-flow-generating shuttle tankers.

	Shuttle tankers primarily differ from conventional oil tankers based on two significant features. First, shuttle tankers are fitted with
	position-keeping equipment enabling them to remain in a position without the assistance of tugs or mooring to installations. Second, shuttle tankers are equipped with bow-loading equipment and, in some cases, also fitted with equipment for submerged
	turret loading. Conventional oil tankers load from an offshore field installation usually through a taut hawser (mooring line onboard the discharging unit) operation and/or with tug assistance. In certain cases, dedicated shuttle tanker newbuilds
	are required to service the specific requirements of oil fields and installations. At times, conventional oil tankers can be converted to shuttle tankers after a substantial upgrade and investment in equipment.

	A time charter is a contract for the use of a specified vessel for a
	fixed period of time at a specified daily rate. Under time charters, the shipowner is responsible for providing crewing and other vessel operating services, the cost of which is included in the daily rate, while the customer is responsible for

	. Class renewal surveys, also known as special surveys, are carried out for the ship&#146;s hull, machinery, including the electrical plant and for any special equipment classed, at the
	intervals indicated by the character of classification for the hull. At the special survey, the vessel is thoroughly examined, including ultrasonic gauging, in order to determine the thickness of the steel structures. Should the thickness be found
	to be less than class requirements, the classification society would require steel renewals. Substantial amounts of money may have to be spent for steel renewals to pass a special survey if the vessel experiences excessive wear and tear. In lieu of
	the special survey every five years, a shipowner has the option of arranging with the classification society for the vessel&#146;s hull or machinery to be on a continuous survey cycle, in which every part of the vessel would be surveyed within a
	five-year cycle. At an owner&#146;s application, the surveys required for class renewal may be split according to an agreed schedule to extend over the entire period of class. This process is referred to as continuous class renewal and though we

	that sets limits on sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide emissions from ship exhausts and prohibits deliberate emissions of ozone depleting substances. Annex VI applies to all ships and, among other things, imposes a global cap on the sulfur content of
	fuel oil and allows for specialized areas to be established internationally with even more stringent controls on sulfur emissions. For vessels 400 gross tons and greater, platforms and drilling rigs, Annex VI imposes various survey and certification
	requirements. Moreover, recent amendments to Annex VI require the imposition of progressively stricter limitations on sulfur emissions from ships. These limitations require that fuels of vessels in covered Emission Control Areas (&#147;ECAs&#148;)
	contain no more than 1% sulfur. The North American ECA came into force on August&nbsp;1, 2012. The North American ECA includes areas subject to the exclusive sovereignty of the United States and extends up to 200 nautical miles from the coasts of

	the coasts of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. Consequently, the sulfur limit in marine fuel is capped at 1%, which is the capped amount for all other ECA areas since July&nbsp;1, 2010. These capped amounts will then

	Resources Board requires vessels to burn fuel with 0.1% sulfur content or less within 24 nautical miles of California as of January&nbsp;1, 2014. As of January&nbsp;1, 2015, all vessels operating within ECAs worldwide must comply with 0.1% sulfur
	requirements. Currently, the only grade of fuel meeting 0.1% sulfur content requirement is low sulfur marine gas oil. From July&nbsp;1, 2010, the reduction of applicable sulfur content limits in the North Sea, the Baltic Sea and the English Channel

	The IMO has negotiated

	Management of Ships&#146; Ballast Water and Sediments (the &#147;BWM Convention&#148;). The BWM Convention&#146;s implementing regulations call for a phased introduction of mandatory ballast water exchange requirements (beginning in 2009), to be
	replaced in time with a requirement for mandatory ballast water treatment. The BWM Convention will not become effective until 12 months after it has been adopted by 30 states, the combined merchant fleets of which represent not less than 35% of the
	gross tonnage of the world&#146;s merchant shipping. Though this has not occurred to-date, the IMO has passed a resolution encouraging the ratification of the BWM Convention and calling upon those countries that have already ratified to encourage
	the installation of ballast water management systems on new ships. As referenced below, the U.S. Coast Guard issued new ballast water management rules on March&nbsp;23, 2012. Under the requirements of the BWM Convention for units with ballast water
	capacity more than 5,000 cubic meters that were constructed in 2011 or before, ballast water management exchange or treatment will be accepted until 2016. From 2016 (or not later than the first intermediate or renewal survey after 2016), only
	ballast water treatment will be accepted by the BWM Convention. Installation of ballast water treatment systems will be needed on our vessels once the convention has been ratified. Although the cost to comply with IMO ballast water treatment

	years, after July 2003); creates obligations on the part of EU member port states to inspect at least 24% of vessels using these ports annually; provides for increased surveillance of vessels posing a high risk to maritime safety or the marine
	environment; and provides the EU with greater authority and control over classification societies, including the ability to seek to suspend or revoke the authority of negligent societies. If deficiencies are found that are clearly hazardous to
	safety, health or the environment, the state is required to detain the vessel until the deficiencies are addressed. Member states are also required to implement a system of penalties for breaches of these standards. EU Directive 2009/16/EC

	. The United States Clean Water Act (&#147;CWA&#148;) prohibits the discharge of oil or
	hazardous substances in United States navigable waters unless authorized by a permit or exemption, and imposes strict liability in the form of penalties for unauthorized discharges. The CWA also imposes substantial liability for the costs of
	removal, remediation and damages and complements the remedies available under OPA 90 and CERCLA. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (the &#147;EPA&#148;) has enacted rules governing the regulation of ballast water discharges and other
	discharges incidental to the normal operation of vessels within U.S. waters. This permit, which the EPA has designated as the Vessel General Permit for Discharges Incidental to the Normal Operation of Vessels (the &#147;VGP&#148;), incorporates the
	current U.S. Coast Guard requirements for ballast water management as well as supplemental ballast water requirements, and includes limits applicable to 26 specific discharge streams, such as deck runoff, bilge water and gray water.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The EPA updated the VGP in 2013 to incorporate numeric effluent limits for ballast water expressed as the maximum concentration of living
	organisms in ballast water, as opposed to the prior non-numeric requirements. These requirements correspond with the IMO&#146;s requirements under the BWM Convention, as discussed above. The permit also contains maximum discharge limitations for
	biocides and residuals. The numeric effluent limits in the new VGP will not apply to all vessels. Those that will be required to comply with the numeric limits will do so under a staggered implementation schedule. Certain existing vessels must
	achieve the numeric effluent limits for ballast water by the first drydocking after January&nbsp;1, 2014 or January&nbsp;1, 2016, depending on the vessel size. Newbuilds are subject to the numeric limits upon the effective date of the new permit.
	Vessels that have deferred deadlines for meeting the numeric standards must meet Best Management Practices, which are substantially similar to the requirements under the previous VGP.

	The new VGP includes a tiered requirement for obtaining coverage based on the size of the vessel and the amount of ballast water carried.
	Vessels that are 300 gross tons or larger and have the capacity to carry more than eight cubic meters of ballast water must submit notices of intent (&#147;NOIs&#148;) to receive permit coverage between six and nine months after the permit&#146;s

	and 50 micrometers in size. For organisms larger than 50 micrometers, the discharge can have no more than ten living organisms per cubic meter of discharge. New ships constructed on or after December&nbsp;1, 2013 must comply with these ballast water

	more stringent and costly compliance or limit contract drilling opportunities, including changes in response to a serious marine incident that results in significant oil pollution or otherwise causes significant adverse environmental impact, such as
	the April 2010 Macondo well blowout incident, could adversely affect our financial results. Although significant capital expenditures may be required to comply with these governmental laws and regulations, such compliance has not materially

	On July&nbsp;15, 2011, the IMO approved mandatory measures to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases from international shipping. The amendments
	to Annex VI to MARPOL for the prevention of air pollution from ships add a new Chapter 4 to Annex VI on energy efficiency requiring the Energy Efficiency Design Index (&#147;EEDI&#148;) for new ships, and the Ship Energy Efficiency Management Plan
	(&#147;SEEMP&#148;) for all ships. The regulations apply to all ships of 400 gross tonnage and above and are entered into force on January&nbsp;1, 2013. These new rules will likely affect the operations of vessels that are registered in countries
	that are signatories to Annex VI to MARPOL or vessels that call upon ports located within such countries. The implementation of the EEDI and SEEMP standards could cause us to incur additional compliance costs. The IMO is also considering the
	development of a market-based mechanism for greenhouse gas emissions from ships, but it is impossible to predict the likelihood that such a standard might be adopted or its potential impact on our operations at this time. The EU has indicated that
	it intends to implement regulation in an effort to limit emissions of greenhouse gases from vessels if such emissions are not regulated through the IMO.

	maritime security. The new chapter came into effect in July 2004 and imposes various detailed security obligations on vessels and port authorities, most of which are contained in the ISPS. The ISPS is designed to protect ports and international
	shipping against terrorism. After July&nbsp;1, 2004, to trade internationally, a vessel must maintain an International Ship Security Certificate (&#147;ISSC&#148;) from a recognized security organization approved by the vessel&#146;s flag state.

	have entered into collective bargaining agreements that cover substantially all of the sailing personnel that operate the vessels in our current fleet, which are flagged in Norway, the Isle of Man, Malta, Denmark, United Kingdom or the Bahamas. We
	believe our relationships with these labor unions are good. Our commitment to training is fundamental to the development of the highest caliber of seafarers for our marine operations. KNOT&#146;s cadet training approach is designed to balance
	academic learning with hands-on training at sea. KNOT trains personnel mainly in Norway and the Philippines and at institutions that utilize ship handling, dynamic positioning and cargo handling simulators. After receiving formal instruction at one
	of these institutions, our seafarers&#146; training continues onboard one of KNOT&#146;s vessels. Additional vessel and equipment training and courses are arranged in accordance with our training policies and the training requirements of our

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	As of February 2016, the shuttle tanker market consisted of approximately 80 vessels and was characterized by long-term charters with offshore
	oil producers. Most shuttle tankers are in the North Sea and offshore Brazil. Demand for shuttle tankers is based on offshore oilfield development and up to mid-2014, higher oil prices and a positive long-term offshore oil outlook led to increased
	activity. However, for the past two years, oil companies have experienced delays in oil production start-up both in the North Sea and Brazil. This has led to a temporary overcapacity, however we have noted that the delaying effect is reducing and as
	there is no speculative ordering, the market is coming close to being balanced. While this has led to reduced activity for vessels without fixed charters, we believe vessels on fixed charters have not been affected. Due to the age structure of the
	fleet, the lack of speculative contracting and the relatively high number of projects under development, we believe the medium to long-term outlook continues to be positive and tendering activity for new projects is expected in 2016. For 2015, one
	new shuttle tanker contract was awarded to Brazilian operations and three shuttle contracts were awarded for Canadian operations. There were no new shuttle tanker contracts awarded for the North Sea operations during 2015.

	Oil prices declined significantly in the latter part of 2014 and in 2015 due to a range of
	factors, notably the increase in US shale oil production, increased production from certain OPEC states and a slowdown in demand from Europe and Asia. Due to the fact that there are a number of existing offshore projects already under development
	where shuttle tankers are required, the decline in oil prices is not expected to materially affect the shuttle tanker market for the next two to three years. However, longer term oil prices will determine the impact on the growth of offshore oil
	production activity when existing projects and projects under development are completed.

	The administrative costs included in our historical

	UK reimburses KOAS UK, KOAS and KNOT Management, as applicable, for their reasonable costs and expenses incurred in connection with the provision of the services subcontracted to KOAS UK, KOAS and KNOT Management under the administrative services

	We are subject to a one-time entrance tax into the Norwegian tonnage tax regime.
</I>

	Our Norwegian subsidiaries are subject to a one-time entrance tax into the tonnage tax regime due to our acquisition in 2013
	of the shares in the subsidiary that owns the
<I>
	Fortaleza Knutsen
</I>
	and the
<I>
	Recife Knutsen
</I>
	. The entrance tax arises when the related party seller is taxed under the ordinary tax regime, and the buyer is taxed under the tonnage tax regime.
	The tax is based on the difference between the market value of the shares and the seller&#146;s tax value of the shares as of the date of contribution. The entrance tax on this gain is payable over several years and is calculated by multiplying the
	Norwegian tax rate by the declining balance of the gain, which will decline by 20% each year. The Norwegian corporate tax rate has been reduced from 28% in 2013 to 27% for 2014 and 2015.

</B>
	Our Norwegian subsidiaries are subject only to Norwegian tonnage tax rather
	than a combination of ordinary taxation and tonnage taxation as reflected in the consolidated and combined carve-out financial statements and accompanying notes included in this Annual Report. Under the tonnage tax regime, the tonnage tax is based
	on the tonnage of the vessel, and operating income is tax free. Tonnage tax is calculated based on the vessel&#146;s net tonnage (in thousands), according to its certificate, multiplied by the days in operation and the applicable dayrate. The net
	financial income and expense remains taxable as ordinary income tax at the regular corporate income tax rate of 27% for Norwegian subsidiaries subject to the tonnage tax regime.

	Time Charter and Bareboat Revenues.

</B>
	Revenues from time charters and bareboat charters are recognized as operating leases on a
	straight-line basis over the term of the charter, net of any commissions. Under time charters, revenue is not recognized during days a vessel is off-hire. Revenue is recognized from delivery of the vessel to the charterer until the end of the lease
	term. Under time charters, we are responsible for providing the crewing and other services related to the vessel&#146;s operation, the cost of which is included in the daily hire rate, except when off-hire. Under bareboat charters, we provide a
	specified vessel for a fixed period of time at a specified hire rate. Revenues are affected by hire rates and the number of days a vessel operates as well as the mix of business between time charters and bareboat charters.

</B>
	Vessel operating expenses include crewing, repairs and
	maintenance, insurance, stores, lube oil and communication expenses. Vessel operating expenses are generally paid by the shipowner under time charters and spot contracts and are recognized when incurred. Vessel operating expenses are paid by the
	customer under bareboat charters.

	Off-hire.
</I>
</B>
	Under our time charters, when the vessel is off-hire, or not available for
	service, the customer generally is not required to pay the hire rate, and the shipowner is responsible for all costs. Prolonged off-hire may lead to a termination of the time charter. A vessel generally will be deemed off-hire if there is a loss of
	time due to, among other things, operational deficiencies, drydocking for repairs, maintenance or inspection, equipment breakdowns, delays due to accidents, crewing strikes, certain vessel detentions or similar problems or the shipowner&#146;s
	failure to maintain the vessel in compliance with its specifications and contractual standards or to provide the required crew. Our bareboat charters do not contain provisions for off-hire. We have obtained loss of hire insurance to protect us
	against loss of income in the event one of our vessels cannot be employed due to damage that is covered under the terms of our hull and machinery insurance. Under our loss of hire policies, our insurer generally will pay us the hire rate agreed in
	respect of each vessel for each day in excess of 14 days and with a maximum period of 180 days.

	Drydocking.
</I>
</B>
	We must
	periodically drydock each of our vessels for inspection, repairs and maintenance and any modifications required to comply with industry certification or governmental requirements. In accordance with industry certification requirements, we drydock
	our vessels at least every 60 months until the vessel is 15 years old, after which drydocking takes place at least every 30 months thereafter as required for the renewal of certifications required by classification societies. For vessels operating
	on time charters, we capitalize the costs directly associated with the classification and regulatory requirements for inspection of the vessels, major repairs and improvements incurred during drydocking that increase the earnings capacity or improve
	the efficiency or safety of the vessels. We expense costs related to routine repairs and maintenance performed during drydocking or as otherwise incurred. For vessels operating on bareboat charters, the customer bears the cost of any drydocking. The
	number of drydockings undertaken in a given period and the nature of the work performed determine the level of drydocking expenditures.

	Depreciation.
</I>
</B>
	Depreciation on vessels and equipment is calculated on a straight-line basis over the asset&#146;s estimated
	useful life of 25 years for the hull and equipment, less an estimated residual value. Drydocking cost is depreciated on a straight-line basis over the period until the next planned drydocking takes place. For vessels that are newly built or
	acquired, an element of the cost of the vessel is allocated initially to a drydock component and depreciated on a straight-line basis over the period until the next planned drydocking. When significant drydocking expenditures occur prior to the
	expiration of this period, we expense the remaining balance of the original drydocking cost in the month of the subsequent drydocking.

	Impairment of Long-Lived Assets.
</I>
</B>
	Vessels and equipment, vessels under construction and intangible assets subject to amortization
	are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. If circumstances require a long-lived asset or asset group to be tested for possible impairment, we first
	compare the undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by that asset or asset group to its carrying value. If the carrying value of the long-lived asset is not recoverable on an undiscounted cash flow basis, an impairment is recognized to the
	extent that the carrying value exceeds its fair value. Fair value is determined through various valuation techniques including discounted cash flow models, quoted market values and third-party independent appraisals, as considered necessary.

	Other income for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2015 was $274,000 compared to $57,000 for

	Charge.
</B>
	Goodwill impairment charge for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2015 was $6.2 million and $nil for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2014. During the three months ended June&nbsp;30, 2015, we concluded that there were indicators of
	impairment due to a significant reduction in the price of our common units during the quarter. Consequently, we performed an interim vessel and goodwill impairment analysis as of June&nbsp;30, 2015 on our fleet, and concluded that there was no
	impairment to the vessels&#146; values. However, we determined that the carrying value of the goodwill exceeded its fair value. The impairment charge relates mainly to capitalized goodwill which arose in 2008 when the Partnership&#146;s predecessor
	acquired the
<I>
	Windsor Knutsen
</I>
	and three other vessels then under construction, in a transaction that was then accounted for as a step transaction. As a result, a goodwill impairment charge of $6.2 million was recognized for the year ended
	December&nbsp;31, 2015. The fair value was determined using the present value of the expected future cash flows discounted at a rate equivalent to a market participant&#146;s weighted average cost of capital. The estimates and assumptions regarding
	expected future cash flows and appropriate discount rates are in part based upon existing contracts, future shuttle tanker rates, historical experience, financial forecasts and industry trends and conditions.

	As of December&nbsp;31, 2015, the total notional amount of our outstanding interest rate swap contracts that
	were entered into in order to economically hedge outstanding or forecasted debt obligations was $410.0 million. In addition to an increased notional amount, the increased net realized and unrealized loss on derivative instruments was due to a
	declining long-term interest rate during 2015 compared to 2014. As of December&nbsp;31, 2015, we had entered into foreign exchange forward contracts, selling a total notional amount of $35.0 million against NOK at an average exchange rate of NOK
	8.2805&nbsp;per U.S.&nbsp;Dollar, which are economic hedges for certain vessel operating expenses and general expenses in NOK. During the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2015, we realized a loss of $4.3 million and accounted for an unrealized gain of
	$0.7 million on our foreign exchange forward contracts due to strengthening of the U.S.&nbsp;Dollar relative to NOK.

	Other finance expense for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2014 was
	$1.3 million, a decrease of $0.8 million from $2.1 million for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2013. Other finance expenses are primarily related to bank fees and guarantee commissions. The decrease was primarily due to a $0.6 million decrease in
	guarantee commissions paid to KNOT and TSSI for the period from January&nbsp;1, 2013 to April&nbsp;15, 2013. Prior to the closing of our IPO, the majority of the vessel financing agreements were guaranteed by KNOT and TSSI, for which guarantee
	commissions were paid based on the outstanding loan balance. Prior to the closing of our IPO, the existing vessel financing agreements were amended to permit the transactions pursuant to which we acquired our initial fleet, and the legal cost of
	approximately $0.3 million in connection with such amendments was expensed for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2013. This decrease was partly offset by expenses of $0.4 million paid as compensation to banks for lost loan margin on repaid loans for

	As of December&nbsp;31, 2014, the total notional amount of our outstanding interest rate swap contracts that
	were entered into in order to economically hedge outstanding or forecasted debt obligations was $382.3 million. In addition to an increased notional amount, the increased net realized and unrealized loss on derivative instruments was due to a
	declining long-term interest rate during 2014 compared to 2013. As of December&nbsp;31, 2014, we had entered into foreign exchange forward contracts, selling a total notional amount of $20.0 million against NOK at an average exchange rate of NOK
	6.395&nbsp;per 1.0 U.S.&nbsp;Dollar, which are economic hedges for certain vessel operating expenses and general expenses in NOK. During the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2014, we realized a gain of $0.5 million and accounted for an unrealized loss
	of $3.0 million on our foreign exchange forward contracts due to strengthening of the U.S.&nbsp;Dollar relative to NOK. The foreign exchange forward contracts realized expired during 2014, and during 2014 the Partnership entered into new foreign
	exchange forward contracts that expire during 2015.

	After the reorganization of the activities of the predecessor to KNOT Offshore Partners LP (the
	&#147;Predecessor&#148;) into the new group structure in February 2013, all profit from continuing operations in Norway became taxable within the tonnage tax regime and deferred tax benefits are not recognized because future utilization is not
	probable. The consequence of the reorganization was a one-time entrance tax into the Norwegian tonnage tax regime due to our acquisition of the shares in the subsidiary that owns the
<I>
	Fortaleza Knutsen
</I>
	and the
<I>
	Recife Knutsen
</I>
	. The
	one-time entrance tax was estimated to be approximately $2.7 million at December&nbsp;31, 2013 of which approximately $0.6 million was payable in October 2014.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Under the tonnage tax regime, the tax is based on the tonnage of the vessel and the operating income is not taxed. The net financial income
	and expense remains taxable as ordinary income tax for entities subject to the tonnage tax regime and amounted to approximately $0.2 million in 2013. In addition, the income tax expense in 2013 consisted of income taxes related to the ordinary
	Norwegian tax regime partly related to the carve-out period, and negative translation differences of $0.2 million. As of December&nbsp;31, 2014, the income tax of $15,000 relates to UK income tax. All Norwegian subsidiaries and their operations are
	subject to the tonnage tax regime and at December&nbsp;31, 2014 their tax base was negative.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The tax expense prior to our IPO reflects
	the Norwegian ordinary tax regime in addition to the tonnage tax regime. The tax expense and the deferred tax assets and liabilities prior to our IPO are, therefore, not comparable to the ongoing operation and the tax after the date of our IPO. All
	of the tax positions related to the ordinary Norwegian tax regime were eliminated at the date of our IPO. For additional information, please read Note 17&#151;Income Taxes in the consolidated and combined carve-out financial statements included in

	We operate in a
	capital-intensive industry, and we expect to finance the purchase of additional vessels and other capital expenditures through a combination of borrowings from commercial banks, cash generated from operations and debt and equity financings. In
	addition to paying distributions, our other liquidity requirements relate to servicing our debt, funding investments (including the equity portion of investments in vessels), funding working capital and maintaining cash reserves against fluctuations
	in operating cash flows. We believe our current resources are sufficient to meet our working capital requirements for our current business. Generally, our long-term sources of funds are cash from operations, long-term bank borrowings and other debt
	and equity financings. Because we distribute our available cash, we rely upon external financing sources, including bank borrowings and the issuance of debt and equity securities, to fund acquisitions and other expansion capital expenditures.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Our funding and treasury activities are intended to maximize investment returns while maintaining appropriate liquidity. Cash and cash
	equivalents are held primarily in U.S. Dollars with some balances held in NOK, British Pounds and Euros. We have not made use of derivative instruments other than for interest rate and currency risk management purposes, and we expect to economically
	hedge our exposure to interest rate fluctuations in the future by entering into new interest rate swap contracts. However, the interest rate swap contracts that were in effect at the time of our IPO were not transferred to us at the closing of our
	IPO.

	We estimate that we will spend in total approximately $17.9 million for drydocking and classification surveys for the six vessels
	under time charters in our fleet in 2016, 2017 and 2018. As our fleet matures and expands, our drydocking expenses will likely increase. Ongoing costs for compliance with environmental regulations are primarily included as part of our drydocking and
	society classification survey costs or are a component of our vessel operating expenses. We are not aware of any regulatory changes or environmental liabilities that we anticipate will have a material impact on our current or future operations.
	There will be further costs related to voyages to and from the dry-docking yard that will depend on the distance from the vessel&#146;s ordinary trading area to dry-docking yard.

	. The carrying value of vessels and equipment represent its historical acquisition or construction cost, including
	capitalized interest, supervision and technical and delivery cost, net of accumulated depreciation and impairment loss, if any. Expenditures for subsequent conversions and major improvements are capitalized, provided that such costs increase the
	earnings capacity or improve the efficiency or safety of the vessels. We depreciate the original cost, less an estimated residual value, of our vessels on a straight-line basis over each vessel&#146;s estimated useful life. The carrying value of our
	vessels may not represent their market value at any point in time, because the market prices of second-hand vessels tend to fluctuate with changes in hire rates and the cost of newbuilds.

	We review vessels and equipment for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be
	recoverable, which occurs when the asset&#146;s carrying value is greater than the future undiscounted cash flows the asset is expected to generate over its remaining useful life. For a vessel under charter, the discounted cash flows from that
	vessel may exceed its market value, as market values may assume the vessel is not employed on an existing charter. If the estimated future undiscounted cash flows of an asset exceed the asset&#146;s carrying value, no impairment is recognized even
	though the fair value of the asset may be lower than its carrying value. If the estimated future undiscounted cash flows of an asset are less than the asset&#146;s carrying value and the fair value of the asset is less than its carrying value, the
	asset is written down to its fair value. Fair value may be determined through various valuation techniques but is generally calculated as the net present value of estimated future cash flows.

	Our business model is to employ our vessels on fixed-rate charters with major energy companies. These charters typically have original terms
	between five to ten years in length. Consequently, while the market value of a vessel may decline below its carrying value, the carrying value of a vessel may still be recoverable based on the future undiscounted cash flows the vessel is expected to
	obtain from servicing its existing and future charters.

	future cash flows involve assumptions about future hire rates, vessel utilization, operating expenses, drydocking expenditures, vessel residual values and the remaining estimated life of our vessels. Our estimated hire rates are based on rates under

	and operating requirements. Vessel residual values are a product of a vessel&#146;s lightweight tonnage and an estimated scrap rate. The remaining estimated lives of our vessels used in our estimates of future cash flows are consistent with those
	used in the calculation of depreciation. Certain assumptions relating to our estimates of future cash flows are more predictable by their nature in our experience, including estimated revenue under existing charter terms, ongoing operating costs and
	remaining vessel lives. Certain assumptions relating to our estimates of future cash flows require more discretion and are inherently less predictable, such as future hire rates beyond the firm period of existing charters and vessel residual values,
	due to factors such as the volatility in hire rates and vessel residual values. We believe that the assumptions used to estimate future cash flows of our vessels are reasonable at the time they are made. We can make no assurances, however, as to

	The allocation of the purchase price of
	acquired companies requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions, including estimates of future cash flows expected to be generated by the acquired assets and the appropriate discount rate to value these cash flows. In addition,
	the process of evaluating the potential impairment of goodwill and intangible assets is highly subjective and requires significant judgment at many points during the analysis. We test goodwill for impairment using a two-step analysis, with the
	option of performing a qualitative assessment before performing the first step of the two-step analysis, whereby the carrying value of the reporting unit is compared to its fair value in the first step. If the carrying value of the reporting unit is
	greater than its fair value, the second step is performed, where the implied fair value of goodwill is compared to its carrying value. An impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its fair value.
	The fair value is estimated using the net present value of discounted cash flows of the reporting unit. The estimates and assumptions regarding expected future cash flows and appropriate discount rates are in part based upon existing contracts,
	future shuttle tanker rates, historical experience, financial forecasts and industry trends and conditions.

</I>
	During the three months ended June&nbsp;30, 2015, the Partnership concluded that indicators of impairment were present due to a significant reduction in the price of the Partnership&#146;s common units during that
	quarter. Consequently, the Partnership performed an interim vessel and goodwill impairment analysis as of June&nbsp;30, 2015 on its fleet, concluding that there was no impairment to the vessels&#146; values. However, the Partnership determined that
	the carrying value of the goodwill exceeded its fair value. The impairment charge relates mainly to capitalized goodwill which arose in 2008 when the Partnership&#146;s predecessor acquired the
<I>
	Windsor Knutsen
</I>
	and three other vessels then
	under construction, in a transaction that was then accounted for as a step transaction. As a result, a goodwill impairment charge of $6.2 million was recognized for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2015. The fair value was determined using the
	present value of the expected future cash flows discounted at a rate equivalent to a market participant&#146;s weighted average cost of capital. The estimates and assumptions regarding expected future cash flows and appropriate discount rates are in
	part based upon existing contracts, future shuttle tanker rates, historical experience, financial forecasts and industry trends and conditions. This non-cash impairment charge reduced the Partnership&#146;s remaining goodwill balance to zero.

	In connection with monitoring compliance with our credit facilities and as a general business
	matter, we periodically monitor the market value of our vessels, including by obtaining various broker valuations as of specific dates. We generally do not include the impact of market fluctuations in vessel prices in our financial statements. We
	do, however, monitor our business and assets on a regular basis for potential asset impairment as described above. The total carrying value of our vessels was $1,193 million as of December&nbsp;31, 2015. With respect to the vessels, based on broker
	valuations as of December&nbsp;31, 2015, and disregarding the charters attached to each of the vessels, we believe the aggregate market value of these vessels was less than their aggregate carrying value as of that date. We believe the aggregate
	amount of this deficit as of December&nbsp;31, 2015 for the vessels was approximately $125 million. These vessels do, however, have long-term charters with fixed rates attached. We believe that our recoverable amount for each of these vessels
	exceeded the applicable carrying value as of December&nbsp;31, 2015, and, accordingly, have not recorded impairment charges even though the vessels have experienced a decline in charter free market value (i.e. disregarding the charters attached to
	each of the vessels).

	Description
</I>
	. We drydock each of our vessels periodically for inspection, repairs and maintenance and for any modifications to comply
	with industry certification or governmental requirements. For vessels operating on time charters, we capitalize the costs directly associated with the classification and regulatory requirements for inspection of the vessels, major repairs and
	improvements incurred during drydocking that increase the earnings capacity or improve the efficiency or safety of the vessels. Drydocking cost is depreciated on a straight-line basis over the period until the next planned drydocking takes place. We
	expense costs related to routine repairs and maintenance performed during drydocking or as otherwise incurred. For vessels that are newly built or acquired, an element of the cost of the vessel is allocated initially to a drydock component and
	depreciated on a straight-line basis over the period until the next planned drydocking. When significant drydocking expenditures occur prior to the expiration of this period, we expense the remaining unamortized balance of the original drydocking
	cost in the month of the subsequent drydocking. For vessels operating on bareboat charters, the charterer bears the cost of any drydocking.

	Judgments and Uncertainties

	. Depreciation of capitalized drydock expenditures requires us to estimate the period of the next drydocking
	or estimated useful life of drydock expenditures. While we typically drydock our vessels every 60 months until the vessel is 15 years old and every 30 months thereafter, we may drydock the vessels at an earlier date.

<I>
	Judgments and Uncertainties
</I>
	. We record a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not
	that some or all of the benefit from the deferred tax asset will not be realized. The future realization of deferred tax assets depends on the existence of sufficient taxable income of the appropriate character in the carry forward period. This
	analysis requires, among other things, the use of estimates and projections in determining future reversals of temporary differences and forecasts of future profitability and evaluating potential tax-planning strategies. The valuation allowances as
	of December&nbsp;31, 2013 were related to the financial loss carry forwards and other net deferred tax assets for Norwegian tonnage tax. In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, we considered all the positive and negative evidence
	available. Given our cumulative loss position for tonnage tax, we determined it was more likely than not that some of the benefit from the deferred tax assets would not be realized based on the weight of available evidence. As of December&nbsp;31,
	2014, we determined that the deferred tax assets are likely to not be realized, and the booked value was, therefore, zero.
</P>

<I>
	Effect If
	Actual Results Differ from Assumptions
</I>
	. If we determined that we were able to realize a net deferred tax asset in the future, in excess of the net recorded amount, an adjustment to decrease the valuation allowance related to the deferred tax
	assets would typically increase our net income (or decrease our loss) in the period such determination was made. Likewise, if we determined that we were not able to realize all or a part of our deferred tax asset in the future, an adjustment to
	increase the valuation allowance related to the deferred tax assets would typically decrease our net income (or increase our loss) in the period such determination was made. As of December&nbsp;31, 2015 and 2014, we had a valuation allowance of
	$10.3 million and $9.1 million, respectively.

	In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) and the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) issued a comprehensive
	revenue recognition standard that will supersede virtually all of the existing revenue recognition guidance. The standard is intended to increase comparability across industries and jurisdictions. The single, global revenue recognition model applies
	to most contacts with customers. Leases, insurance contracts, financial instruments, guarantees and certain non-monetary transactions are excluded from the scope of the guidance. Revenue will be recognized in a manner that depicts the transfer of
	goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which an entity expects to be entitled, subject to certain limitations. The FASB deferred by one year the effective date of its new revenue recognition standard for
	public entities reporting under U.S. GAAP. The new revenue recognition standard will be effective for public entities for annual reporting periods beginning after December&nbsp;15, 2017, including interim reporting periods within that reporting
	period. Public and nonpublic entities will be permitted to adopt the standard as early as the original public entity effective date (i.e., annual reporting periods beginning after December&nbsp;15, 2016 and interim periods therein). Early adoption
	prior to that date is not permitted. The Partnership is assessing what impact, if any, the adoption of the guidance will have on its financial position, results of operations and cash flows.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	In August 2014, FASB issued Presentation of Financial Statements &#150; Going Concern (Subtopic 205-40), Disclosures of Uncertainties about an
	Entity&#146;s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern (Accounting Standards Update (ASU) -2014-15). ASU 2014-15 provides guidance in GAAP about management&#146;s responsibility to evaluate whether there are conditions and events that raise
	substantial doubt about the entity&#146;s ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the financial statements are issued (or available to be issued when applicable) and, if so, disclose that fact. Management will be required to
	make this evaluation for both annual and interim reporting periods, if applicable. Management also is required to evaluate and disclose whether its plans alleviate that doubt. The standard is effective for annual periods after December&nbsp;15, 2016
	and interim periods within annual periods beginning after December&nbsp;15, 2016. Early adoption is permitted. The Partnership is evaluating the effect of adopting this new accounting guidance. The Partnership does not expect the adoption of this
	standard to have a material impact on the consolidated and combined financial statements.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	In April 2015, FASB issued Interest &#150;
	Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30), Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs. ASU 2015-03 requires that debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the
	carrying amount of that debt liability rather than as an asset. This will make the presentation of debt issuance costs consistent with the presentation of debt discounts or premiums. The guidance also addresses the long-standing conflict with the
	conceptual framework and improves consistency with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS).The recognition and measurement guidance for debt issuance costs is not affected. The standard does not address the presentation of costs that does
	not have an associated liability. The guidance is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December&nbsp;15, 2015. Early adoption is permitted. The Partnership has not yet adopted ASU 2015-03. The adoption of the new standard will
	have an impact on the Partnership&#146;s balance sheets and reduce total assets and total liabilities and will be applied retrospectively.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	In June 2015, FASB issued Technical Corrections and Improvements (ASU 2015-10) to correct differences between original guidance and the ASC,
	clarify the guidance, correct references and make minor improvements affecting a variety of topics. While most of the amendments are not expected to have a significant effect on practice, some of them could change practice for some entities.
	Amendments that the FASB deemed more substantive are effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December&nbsp;15, 2015. The other amendments are effective immediately. The Partnership is assessing what
	impact, if any, this guidance will have on its consolidated and combined financial position, results of operations and cash flows.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	In
	August 2015, FASB issued ASU 2015-15 to incorporate into the Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) an SEC staff announcement that the SEC staff will not object to an entity presenting the cost of securing a revolving line of credit as a deferred
	asset, regardless of whether a balance is outstanding. The announcement came in response to questions that arose after the FASB issued ASU 2015-03 Interest &#150; Imputation of interest (Subtopic 835-30) &#150; Simplifying the Presentation of Debt
	Issuance Costs. The standard, as issued, did not address revolving lines of credit, which may not have outstanding balances. An entity that repeatedly draws on a revolving credit facility and then repays the balance could present the cost as a
	deferred asset and reclassify all or a portion of it as a direct deduction from the liability whenever a balance is outstanding. However, the SEC staff&#146;s announcement provides a less cumbersome alternative. Either way, the cost should be
	amortized over the term of the arrangement. The guidance is effective upon announcement by the SEC staff on June&nbsp;18, 2015. The Partnership is assessing what impact, if any, the adoption of this guidance will have its financial position and it
	may have an impact on the balance sheets depending on whether the Partnership withdraws and use it revolving line of credit.

	In November 2015, FASB issued guidance on Income Taxes (Topic 740), Balance Sheet Classification
	of Deferred Taxes (ASU 2015-17). Companies are required to classify all deferred tax assets and liabilities as noncurrent on the balance sheet instead of separating deferred taxes into current and noncurrent amount. Also, companies will no longer
	allocate valuation allowances between current and noncurrent deferred tax assets because those allowances also will be classified as noncurrent. The FASB staff is performing additional research on companion proposal requiring companies to
	immediately recognize income tax expenses or benefits on intercompany transactions. Since early adoption of the guidance is permitted, companies can start applying it in interim and annual financial statements that have not yet been issued. For
	public business entities the guidance is effective for financial statements issued for annual periods beginning after December&nbsp;15, 2016, and interim periods within those annual periods. For all other entities, the guidance is effective for
	financial statements issued for annual periods beginning after December&nbsp;15, 2017, and interim periods within annual periods beginning after December&nbsp;15, 2018. Companies can adopt the guidance either prospectively or retrospectively. The

	Waryas, Jr., Andrew Beveridge and Simon Bird. Mr.&nbsp;Seglem, Mr.&nbsp;Nishiyama and Mr.&nbsp;Konuma and have been appointed by our general partner. Mr.&nbsp;Aas, Mr.&nbsp;Waryas and Mr.&nbsp;Beveridge were elected by our common unitholders.
	Mr.&nbsp;Bird was appointed by the remaining elected directors pursuant to our partnership agreement to replace John Costain upon his resignation from our board of directors in May 2015. Directors appointed by our general partner serve as directors
	for terms determined by our general partner. Directors elected by our common unitholders are divided into four classes serving staggered four-year terms. Mr.&nbsp;Waryas is designated as the Class I elected director and will serve until our annual
	meeting of unitholders in 2018, Mr.&nbsp;Beveridge is designated as the Class II elected director and will serve until our annual meeting of unitholders in 2019, Mr.&nbsp;Bird is designated as our Class III elected director and will serve until our
	annual meeting of unitholders in 2016, and Mr.&nbsp;Aas is designated as our Class IV elected director and will serve until our annual meeting of unitholders in 2017. At each annual meeting of unitholders, directors will be elected to succeed the
	class of director whose term has expired by a plurality of the votes of the common unitholders. Directors elected by our common unitholders will be nominated by our board of directors or by any limited partner or group of limited partners that holds
	at least 10% of the outstanding common units.

	Each outstanding common unit is entitled to one vote on matters subject to a vote of common
	unitholders. However, if at any time, any person or group owns beneficially more than 4.9% or more of any class of units then outstanding (excluding units held by Norwegian Resident Holders in the election of the elected directors as discussed
	below), any such units owned by that person or group in excess of 4.9% may not be voted (except for purposes of nominating a person for election to our board of directors). The voting rights of any such unitholders in excess of 4.9% will effectively
	be redistributed pro rata among the other common unitholders holding less than 4.9% of the voting power of such class of units. Our general partner, its affiliates and persons who acquire common units with the prior approval of our board of
	directors are not subject to this 4.9% limitation except with respect to voting their common units in the election of the elected directors.

	Because we qualify as a foreign private issuer under SEC rules, we are permitted to follow the corporate governance practices of the Marshall
	Islands (the jurisdiction in which we are organized) in lieu of certain of the NYSE corporate governance requirements that would otherwise be applicable to us. The NYSE rules do not require a listed company that is a foreign private issuer to have a
	board of directors that is comprised of a majority of independent directors. Under Marshall Islands law, we are not required to have a board of directors comprised of a majority of directors meeting the independence standards described in the NYSE
	rules. In addition, the NYSE rules do not require limited partnerships like us to have boards of directors comprised of a majority of independent directors. The NYSE rules do not require foreign private issuers or limited partnerships like us to
	establish a compensation committee or a nominating/corporate governance committee. Similarly, under Marshall Islands law, we are not required to have a compensation committee or a nominating/corporate governance committee. Accordingly, we do not
	have a compensation committee or a nominating/corporate governance committee. For a listing and further discussion of how our corporate governance practices differ from those required of U.S. companies listed on the NYSE, please read &#147;Item 16G.

	Common unitholders are entitled under our partnership agreement to receive a quarterly distribution of $0.375 per unit, or $1.50
	per unit per year, prior to any distribution on the subordinated units to the extent we have sufficient cash on hand to pay the distribution, after establishment of cash reserves and payment of fees and expenses. There is no guarantee that we will
	pay the minimum quarterly distribution on the common units and subordinated units in any quarter. Even if our cash distribution policy is not modified or revoked, the amount of distributions paid under our policy and the decision to make any
	distribution is determined by our board of directors, taking into consideration the terms of our partnership agreement. We are prohibited from making any distributions to unitholders if it would cause an event of default, or an event of default is
	then existing, under our financing agreements. Please read &#147;Item 5. Operating and Financial Review and Prospects&#151;Liquidity and Capital Resources&#148; for a discussion of the restrictions contained in our credit facilities and lease
	arrangements that may restrict our ability to make cash distributions to our unitholders.

	distributions of available cash from operating surplus in an amount equal to the minimum quarterly distribution of $0.375 per unit, plus any arrearages in the payment of the minimum quarterly distribution on the common units from prior quarters,
	before any distributions of available cash from operating surplus may be made on the subordinated units. Distribution arrearages do not accrue on the subordinated units. The purpose of the subordinated units is to increase the likelihood that during
	the subordination period there will be available cash from operating surplus to be distributed on the common units. We currently expect that the subordination period will end in the second quarter of 2016.

	Incentive distribution rights represent the right to receive an increasing percentage of quarterly distributions of available cash from
	operating surplus after the minimum quarterly distribution and the target distribution levels have been achieved. KNOT currently holds the incentive distribution rights. The incentive distribution rights may be transferred separately from any other
	interest, subject to restrictions in our partnership agreement. Except for transfers of incentive distribution rights to an affiliate or another entity as part of a merger or consolidation with or into, or sale of substantially all of its assets to
	such entity, the approval of a majority of our common units (excluding common units held by our general partner and its affiliates), voting separately as a class, generally is required for a transfer of the incentive distribution rights to a third
	party prior to March&nbsp;31, 2018. Any transfer by KNOT of the incentive distribution rights would not change the percentage allocations of quarterly distributions with respect to such rights.

	The following table illustrates the percentage allocations of the additional available cash from operating surplus among our unitholders, our
	general partner and the holders of the incentive distribution rights up to the various target distribution levels. The amounts set forth under &#147;Marginal Percentage Interest in Distributions&#148; are the percentage interests of our unitholders,
	our general partner and the holders of the incentive distribution rights in any available cash from operating surplus we distribute up to and including the corresponding amount in the column &#147;Total Quarterly Distribution Target,&#148; until
	available cash from operating surplus we distribute reaches the next target distribution level, if any. The percentage interests shown for our unitholders, our general partner and the holders of the incentive distribution rights for the minimum
	quarterly distribution are also applicable to quarterly distributions that are less than the minimum quarterly distribution. The percentage interests set forth in the table below assume that our general partner owns a 2.0% general partner interest
	and that we do not issue additional classes of equity securities.

	Subject to the discussion below of the rules applicable to PFICs, any distributions to a U.S. Holder made by us with respect to our common
	units generally will constitute dividends to the extent of our current and accumulated earnings and profits, as determined under U.S. federal income tax principles. We expect that the distributions we pay to U.S. Holders will not exceed our current
	and accumulated earnings and profits and, accordingly, all such distributions will constitute dividends. If, notwithstanding that expectation, we make distributions to U.S. Holders in excess of our earnings and profits, the excess portion of those
	distributions will be treated first as a nontaxable return of capital to the extent of the U.S. Holder&#146;s tax basis in its common units and thereafter as capital gain. U.S. Holders that are corporations generally will not be entitled to claim a
	dividends received deduction with respect to distributions they receive from us because we are not a U.S. corporation. Dividends received with respect to our common units generally will be treated as &#147;passive category income&#148; for purposes

	Dividends received with respect to our common units by a

	(1)&nbsp;our common units are readily tradable on an established securities market in the United States (such as the NYSE on which our common units are traded); (2)&nbsp;we are not a PFIC for the taxable year during which the dividend is paid or the
	immediately preceding taxable year (which we do not believe we are, have been or will be, as discussed below under &#147;&#151;PFIC Status and Significant Tax Consequences&#148;); (3)&nbsp;the U.S. Individual Holder has owned the common units for
	more than 60 days during the 121-day period beginning 60 days before the date on which the common units become ex-dividend (and has not entered into certain risk limiting transactions with respect to such common units); and (4)&nbsp;the U.S.
	Individual Holder is not under an obligation to make related payments with respect to positions in substantially similar or related property. Because of the uncertainty of these matters, including whether we are or will be a PFIC, there is no
	assurance that any dividends paid on our common units will be eligible for these preferential rates in the hands of a U.S. Individual Holder, and any dividends paid on our common units that are not eligible for these preferential rates will be taxed

	Special rules may apply to any amounts received in respect of our common units that are

	unitholder&#146;s election) in such common unit. In addition, extraordinary dividends include dividends received within a one-year period that, in the aggregate, equal or exceed 20% of a unitholder&#146;s adjusted tax basis (or fair market value).
	If we pay an &#147;extraordinary dividend&#148; on our common units that is treated as &#147;qualified dividend income,&#148; then any loss recognized by a U.S. Individual Holder from the sale or exchange of such common units will be treated as

	Subject to the discussion of PFIC status below, a U.S. Holder generally will recognize capital gain or loss upon a sale, exchange
	or other disposition of our units in an amount equal to the difference between the amount realized by the U.S. Holder from such sale, exchange or other disposition and the U.S. Holder&#146;s adjusted tax basis in such units. The U.S. Holder&#146;s
	initial tax basis in its units generally will be the U.S. Holder&#146;s purchase price for the units and that tax basis will be reduced (but not below zero) by the amount of any distributions on the units that are treated as non-taxable returns of
	capital (as discussed above under &#147;&#151;Distributions&#148;). Such gain or loss will be treated as long-term capital gain or loss if the U.S. Holder&#146;s holding period is greater than one year at the time of the sale, exchange or other
	disposition. Certain U.S. Holders (including individuals) may be eligible for preferential rates of U.S. federal income tax in respect of long-term capital gains. A U.S. Holder&#146;s ability to deduct capital losses is subject to limitations. Such

	Moreover, there are legal uncertainties involved in determining whether the income derived from time-chartering activities constitutes rental
	income or income derived from the performance of services. In
<I>
	Tidewater Inc. v. United States
</I>
	, 565 F.3d 299 (5th Cir. 2009), the Fifth Circuit held that income derived from certain time-chartering activities should be treated as rental income
	rather than services income for purposes of a provision of the Code relating to foreign sales corporations. In that case, the Fifth Circuit did not address the definition of passive income or the PFIC rules; however, the reasoning of the case could
	have implications as to how the income from a time charter would be classified under such rules. If the reasoning of the case were extended to the PFIC context, the gross income we derive from our time-chartering activities may be treated as rental
	income, and we would likely be treated as a PFIC. In published guidance, the IRS stated that it disagreed with the holding in
<I>
	Tidewate
</I>
	r and specified that time charters similar to those at issue in this case should be treated as service
	contracts.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Distinguishing between arrangements treated as generating rental income and those treated as generating services income
	involves weighing and balancing competing factual considerations, and there is no legal authority under the PFIC rules addressing our specific method of operation. Conclusions in this area therefore remain matters of interpretation. We are not
	seeking a ruling from the IRS on the treatment of income generated from our time-chartering operations. Thus, it is possible that the IRS or a court could disagree with our position. In addition, although we intend to conduct our affairs in a manner
	to avoid being classified as a PFIC with respect to any taxable year, we cannot assure unitholders that the nature of our operations will not change in the future and that we will not become a PFIC in any future taxable year.

	As discussed more fully below, if we were to be treated as a PFIC for any taxable year (and regardless of whether we remain a PFIC over the
	subsequent taxable years), a U.S. Holder would be subject to different taxation rules depending on whether the U.S. Holder makes an election to treat us as a &#147;Qualified Electing Fund,&#148; which we refer to as a &#147;QEF election.&#148; As an
	alternative to making a QEF election, a U.S. Holder should be able to make a &#147;mark-to-market&#148; election with respect to our common units, as discussed below. In addition, if a U.S. Holder owns our common units during any taxable year that
	we are a PFIC, such holder must file an annual report with the IRS.

	If a U.S. Holder makes a timely QEF election (or an Electing Holder), then, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, that holder must
	report as income for its taxable year its pro rata share of our ordinary earnings and net capital gain, if any, for our taxable years that end with or within the taxable year for which that holder is reporting, regardless of whether or not the
	Electing Holder received distributions from us in that year. The Electing Holder&#146;s adjusted tax basis in the common units will be increased to reflect taxed but undistributed earnings and profits. Distributions of earnings and profits that were
	previously taxed will result in a corresponding reduction in the Electing Holder&#146;s adjusted tax basis in common units and will not be taxed again once distributed. An Electing Holder generally will recognize capital gain or loss on the sale,
	exchange or other disposition of our common units. A U.S. Holder makes a QEF election with respect to any year that we are a PFIC by filing IRS Form 8621 with its U.S. federal income tax return. If contrary to our expectations, we determine that we
	are treated as a PFIC for any taxable year, we will provide each U.S. Holder with the information necessary to make the QEF election described above. Although the QEF election is available with respect to subsidiaries, in the event we acquire or own
	a subsidiary in the future that is treated as a PFIC, no assurances can be made that we will be able to provide U.S. Holders with the necessary information to make the QEF election with respect to such subsidiary.

	instructions and related Treasury Regulations. If that election is made, the U.S. Holder generally would include as ordinary income in each taxable year the excess, if any, of the fair market value of the U.S. Holder&#146;s common units at the end
	of the taxable year over the holder&#146;s adjusted tax basis in the common units. The U.S. Holder also would be permitted an ordinary loss in respect of the excess, if any, of the U.S. Holder&#146;s adjusted tax basis in the common units over the
	fair market value thereof at the end of the taxable year, but only to the extent of the net amount previously included in income as a result of the mark-to-market election. A U.S. Holder&#146;s tax basis in its common units would be adjusted to
	reflect any such income or loss recognized. Gain recognized on the sale, exchange or other disposition of our common units would be treated as ordinary income, and any loss recognized on the sale, exchange or other disposition of the common units
	would be treated as ordinary loss to the extent that such loss does not exceed the net mark-to-market gains previously included in income by the U.S. Holder. The mark-to-market election generally will not be available with respect to subsidiaries.

	We are exposed to various market risks, including interest rate, foreign currency exchange rate and concentration of credit risks.
	Historically, we have entered into certain derivative instruments and contracts to maintain the desired level of exposure arising from interest rate and certain foreign currency exchange rate risks.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">

	A portion of our debt obligations and surplus funds placed with financial institutions are subject to movements in interest rates. It is our
	policy to obtain the most favorable interest rates available without increasing our foreign currency exposure. In keeping with this, our surplus funds may in the future be placed in fixed deposits with reputable financial institutions that yield
	better returns than bank deposits. The deposits generally have short-term maturities so as to provide us with the flexibility to meet working capital and capital investments.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	We have historically used interest rate swap contracts to manage our exposure to interest rate risks. Interest rate swap contracts were used
	to convert floating rate debt obligations based on LIBOR to a fixed rate in order to achieve an overall desired position of fixed and floating rate debt. The extent to which interest rate swap contracts are used is determined by reference to our net
	debt exposure and our views regarding future interest rates. Our interest rate swap contracts do not qualify for hedge accounting, and movements in their fair values are reflected in the statements of operations under &#147;Realized and unrealized
	gain (loss) on derivative instruments.&#148; Interest rate swap contracts that have a positive fair value are recorded as &#147;Other current assets,&#148; while swaps with a negative fair value are recorded as &#147;Derivative liabilities.&#148;

	The Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer does not expect that our disclosure controls or
	internal controls will prevent all errors and all fraud. Although our disclosure controls and procedures were designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives, a control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can
	provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative
	to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Partnership have been detected. These inherent
	limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of
	two or more people, or by management override of the control. The design of any system of controls also is based partly on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in
	achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions.

	Our internal controls were designed to provide reasonable assurance as to the reliability of our financial reporting and the preparation and

	1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets; 2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of
	the financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that our receipts and expenditures are being made in accordance with authorizations of management and the directors; and 3) provide reasonable assurance

	NYSE Listed Company Manual, we are required to state any significant differences between our governance practices and the practices required by the NYSE for U.S. companies. We believe that our established practices in the area of corporate
	governance are in line with the spirit of the NYSE standards and provide adequate protection to our unitholders. The significant differences between our corporate governance practices and the NYSE standards applicable to listed U.S. companies are

	The NYSE rules do not require a listed company that is a foreign private issuer to have a board of directors that is comprised of a majority of
	independent directors. Under Marshall Islands law, we are not required to have a board of directors comprised of a majority of directors meeting the independence standards described in the NYSE rules. In addition, the NYSE rules do not require
	limited partnerships like us to have boards of directors comprised of a majority of independent directors. However, our board of directors has determined that each of Hans Petter Aas, Edward A. Waryas, Jr., Simon Bird and Andrew Beveridge satisfies
	the independence standards established by the NYSE as applicable to us.

	We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we
	plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. We were not engaged to perform an audit of the Partnership&#146;s internal control over financial reporting. Our
	audits included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the
	Partnership&#146;s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the
	accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

	In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of KNOT Offshore
	Partners LP at December&nbsp;31, 2015 and 2014, and the consolidated and combined results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December&nbsp;31, 2015, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted
	accounting principles.

	KNOT Offshore Partners LP (the &#147;Partnership&#148;) was formed as a limited partnership under the laws of the Republic
	of the Marshall Islands. The Partnership was formed for the purpose of acquiring 100% ownership interests in four shuttle tankers owned by Knutsen NYK Offshore Tankers AS (&#147;KNOT&#148;) in connection with the Partnership&#146;s initial public
	offering of its common units (the &#147;IPO&#148;), which was completed on April&nbsp;15, 2013.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The Partnership was established prior to
	the closing of the IPO. In connection with the consummation of the IPO, through KNOT Offshore Partners UK LLC (&#147;KNOT UK&#148;), a 100% owned limited liability company formed under the laws of the Marshall Islands, the Partnership acquired a
	100% ownership interest in KNOT Shuttle Tankers AS, a wholly owned subsidiary of KNOT, which as of February&nbsp;27, 2013 directly or indirectly owned (1)&nbsp;100% of Knutsen Shuttle Tankers XII KS, the owner of the
<I>
	Recife Knutsen
</I>
	and the
<I>
	Fortaleza Knutsen

<I>
	Windsor Knutsen
</I>
	and the
<I>
	Bodil Knutsen
</I>
	and all of their related charters, inventory and
	long-term debt. In establishing the new KNOT Shuttle Tankers AS structure, KNOT formed three new Norwegian subsidiaries, which acquired 90% of Knutsen Shuttle Tankers XII KS, 100% of the
<I>
	Windsor Knutsen
</I>
	and 100% of the
<I>
	Bodil Knutsen
</I>
	,
	respectively.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	In connection with the consummation of the IPO, (1)&nbsp;the Partnership issued to KNOT 8,567,500 subordinated units,
	representing a 49.0% limited partner interest in the Partnership, and 100% of the incentive distribution rights (&#147;IDRs&#148;); (2)&nbsp;KNOT Offshore Partners GP LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of KNOT and the general partner of the Partnership
	(the &#147;General Partner&#148;), continued its 2.0% general partner interest in the Partnership; and (3)&nbsp;the Partnership issued and sold to the public, through the underwriters, 8,567,500 common units (including 1,117,500 common units sold
	pursuant to the full exercise of the underwriters&#146; option to purchase additional units), representing a 49.0% limited partner interest in the Partnership. The Partnership received gross proceeds before underwriting discounts, the structuring
	fee and estimated offering expenses of approximately $179.9 million in connection with the IPO, all as further described in Note 3&#151;Formation Transactions and Initial Public Offering.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	For periods prior to April&nbsp;15, 2013 (the closing of the IPO), the Partnership and its subsidiaries that had interests in the

</I>
	, the
<I>
	Bodil Knutsen
</I>
	, the
<I>
	Recife Knutsen
</I>
	and the
<I>
	Fortaleza Knutsen
</I>
	from KNOT to the Partnership in connection with the IPO were deemed to be a reorganization of entities under common control. As a
	reorganization of entities under common control, the transfer of the subsidiaries and other net assets has been recorded at KNOT&#146;s historical book value.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Pursuant to the Partnership&#146;s First Amended and Restated Agreement of Limited Partnership (the &#147;Partnership Agreement&#148;), the
	General Partner has irrevocably delegated to the Partnership&#146;s board of directors the power to oversee and direct the operations of, manage and determine the strategies and policies of the Partnership. During the period from the IPO until the
	time of the Partnership&#146;s first annual meeting of unitholders (&#147;AGM&#148;) on June&nbsp;25, 2013, the General Partner retained the sole power to appoint, remove and replace all members of the Partnership&#146;s board of directors. At the
	first AGM, four of the seven board members became electable by the common unitholders and accordingly, from this date, KNOT, as the owner of the General Partner, no longer retained the power to control the Partnership&#146;s board of directors and
	hence the Partnership. As a result, the Partnership is no longer considered to be under common control with KNOT, and, as a consequence, the Partnership no longer accounts for any vessel acquisitions from KNOT after June&nbsp;25, 2013 as a transfer
	of equity interests between entities under common control.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	On August&nbsp;1, 2013, the Partnership&#146;s wholly owned subsidiary, KNOT
	Shuttle Tankers AS, acquired Knutsen Shuttle Tankers 13 AS, the company that owns the
<I>
	Carmen Knutsen
</I>
	, from KNOT. The acquisition of the
<I>
	Carmen Knutsen
</I>
	was accounted for as an acquisition of a business. Accordingly, the results of the
<I>
	Carmen Knutsen
</I>
	are consolidated into the Partnership&#146;s results from the date of its acquisition. There has been no retroactive restatement of the Partnership&#146;s financial statements to reflect the historical results of the

	Carmen
	Knutsen
</I>
	prior to its acquisition.

	The consolidated and combined carve-out financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Partnership

	therefore, presented as current debt. Furthermore, included within current liabilities as of December&nbsp;31, 2015, are: (i)&nbsp;mark-to-market valuations of swap derivatives and foreign exchange forward contracts of $5.1 million of which $3.8
	million is mark-to-market valuations of interest rate swap derivatives and $1.3 million is mark-to-market valuation of foreign exchange forward contracts. The swaps mature between 2018 and 2024. The Partnership has no intention of terminating these
	swaps before their maturity dates and hence realizing theses liabilities; (ii)&nbsp;prepaid charter and deferred revenues of $3.4 million which relate to charter hire received in advance from charterers; and (iii)&nbsp;contract liabilities of $1.5
	million, which is the current portion of contractual rights for charters obtained in connection with a step acquisition that had unfavorable terms. The unfavorable contract liabilities of $1.5 million will amortize during 2016, thus no cash outflows
	are expected in respect of these liabilities in the next twelve months.

	The interest rate swaps were entered into in conjunction with the individual Vessel financing to secure fixed interest rates. The interest rate swaps are included in the combined carve-out financial statements to reflect all of the historical cost
	of doing business even though they will not be transferred to the Partnership. The foreign exchange forward contracts were entered into in conjunction with the construction of certain of the individual Vessels to secure the amounts payable in

	distribution. In addition, re-organization of entities under common control is accounted for as if the transfer occurred from the date that both the combining entity and combined entity were both under common control. Therefore, the

	As discussed in Note 1&#151;Description of Business, under the Partnership&#146;s Partnership Agreement, the General Partner has
	irrevocably delegated to the Partnership&#146;s board of directors the power to oversee and direct the operations of, manage and determine the strategies and policies of the Partnership. During the period from the IPO in April 2013 until the time of
	the Partnership&#146;s first AGM on June&nbsp;25, 2013, the General Partner retained the sole power to appoint, remove and replace all members of the Partnership&#146;s board of directors. From the date of the Partnership&#146;s first annual meeting
	of common unitholders, four of the seven board members became electable by the common unitholders and accordingly, from this date, KNOT, as the owner of the General Partner, no longer retains the power to control the Partnership&#146;s board of
	directors and, hence, the Partnership. As a result, the Partnership is no longer considered to be under common control with KNOT and as a consequence, the Partnership has not accounted for any acquisitions from KNOT after June&nbsp;25, 2013 as a
	transfer of equity interests between entities under common control.

	Generally, the Partnership drydocks each vessel every 60 months until the vessel is 15 years old and every 30 months thereafter, as required
	for the renewal of certifications issued by classification societies. For vessels operating on time charters, the Partnership capitalizes the costs directly associated with the classification and regulatory requirements for inspection of the
	vessels, major repairs and improvements incurred during drydocking. Drydock cost is depreciated on a straight-line basis over the period until the next planned drydocking takes place. The Partnership expenses costs related to routine repairs and
	maintenance performed during drydocking or as otherwise incurred. For vessels that are newly built or acquired, an element of the cost of the vessel is initially allocated to a drydock component and depreciated on a straight-line basis over the
	period until the next planned drydocking. When significant drydocking expenditures occur prior to the expiration of this period, the Partnership expenses the remaining balance of the original drydocking cost in the month of the subsequent
	drydocking. For vessels operating on bareboat charters, the charterparty bears the cost of any drydocking.

	In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) and the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) issued a comprehensive
	revenue recognition standard that will supersede virtually all of the existing revenue recognition guidance. The standard is intended to increase comparability across industries and jurisdictions. The single, global revenue recognition model applies
	to most contacts with customers. Leases, insurance contracts, financial instruments, guarantees and certain non-monetary transactions are excluded from the scope of the guidance. Revenue will be recognized in a manner that depicts the transfer of
	goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which an entity expects to be entitled, subject to certain limitations. The FASB deferred by one year the effective date of its new revenue recognition standard for
	public and nonpublic entities reporting under U.S. GAAP. The new revenue recognition standard will be effective for public entities for annual reporting periods beginning after December&nbsp;15, 2017, including interim reporting periods within that
	reporting period. Public entities will be permitted to adopt the standard as early as the original public entity effective date (i.e., annual reporting periods beginning after December&nbsp;15, 2016 and interim periods therein). Early adoption prior
	to that date is not permitted. The Partnership is assessing what impact, if any, the adoption of the guidance will have on its financial position, results of operations and cash flows.

	In August 2014, FASB issued Presentation of Financial Statements &#150; Going Concern (Subtopic 205-40), Disclosures of Uncertainties about an
	Entity&#146;s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern (Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2014-15). ASU 2014-15 provides guidance in GAAP about management&#146;s responsibility to evaluate whether there are conditions and events that raise substantial
	doubt about the entity&#146;s ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the financial statements are issued (or available to be issued when applicable) and, if so, disclose that fact. Management will be required to make this
	evaluation for both annual and interim reporting periods, if applicable. Management also is required to evaluate and disclose whether its plans alleviate that doubt. The standard is effective for annual periods after December&nbsp;15, 2016 and
	interim periods within annual periods beginning after December&nbsp;15, 2016. Early adoption is permitted. The Partnership is evaluating the effect of adopting this new accounting guidance. The Partnership does not expect the adoption of this
	standard to have a material impact on the consolidated and combined financial statements.

	In April 2015, FASB issued Interest &#150;
	Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30), Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs. ASU 2015-03 requires that debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the
	carrying amount of that debt liability rather than as an asset. This will make the presentation of debt issuance costs consistent with the presentation of debt discounts or premiums. The guidance also addresses the long-standing conflict with the
	conceptual framework and improves consistency with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS).The recognition and measurement guidance for debt issuance costs is not affected. The standard does not address the presentation of costs that does
	not have an associated liability. The guidance is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December&nbsp;15, 2015. Early adoption is permitted. The Partnership has not yet adopted ASU 2015-03. The adoption of the new standard will
	have an impact on the Partnership&#146;s balance sheets and reduce total assets and total liabilities and will be applied retrospectively.

	In June 2015, FASB issued Technical Corrections and Improvements (ASU 2015-10) to correct differences between original guidance and the ASC,
	clarify the guidance, correct references and make minor improvements affecting a variety of topics. While most of the amendments are not expected to have a significant effect on practice, some of them could change practice for some entities.
	Amendments that the FSAB deemed more substantive are effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December&nbsp;15, 2015. The other amendments are effective immediately. The Partnership is assessing what
	impact, if any, this guidance will have on its consolidated and combined financial position, results of operations and cash flows.

	credit, which may not have outstanding balances. An entity that repeatedly draws on a revolving credit facility and then repays the balance could present the cost as a deferred asset and reclassify all or a portion of it as a direct deduction from
	the liability whenever a balance is outstanding. However, the SEC staff&#146;s announcement provides a less cumbersome alternative. Either way, the cost should be amortized over the term of the arrangement. The guidance is effective upon
	announcement by the SEC staff on June&nbsp;18, 2015. The Partnership is assessing what impact, if any, the adoption of this guidance will have its financial position and it may have an impact on the balance sheets depending on whether the

	In November 2015, FASB issued guidance on Income Taxes (Topic 740), Balance
	Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes (ASU 2015-17). Companies are required to classify all deferred tax assets and liabilities as noncurrent on the balance sheet instead of separating deferred taxes into current and noncurrent amount. Also,
	companies will no longer allocate valuation allowances between current and noncurrent deferred tax assets because those allowances also will be classified as noncurrent. The FASB staff is performing additional research on companion proposal
	requiring companies to immediately recognize income tax expenses or benefits on intercompany transactions. Since early adoption of the guidance is permitted, companies can start applying it in interim and annual financial statements that have not
	yet been issued. For public business entities the guidance is effective for financial statements issued for annual periods beginning after December&nbsp;15, 2016, and interim periods within those annual periods. For all other entities, the guidance
	is effective for financial statements issued for annual periods beginning after December&nbsp;15, 2017, and interim periods within annual periods beginning after December&nbsp;15, 2018. Companies can adopt the guidance either prospectively or

	Each of the Vessels is employed under long-term fixed rate charters, which mitigates earnings risk. The Partnership&#146;s
	operational results are dependent on the worldwide market for shuttle tankers and timing of entrance into long-term charters. Market conditions for shipping activities are typically volatile, and, as a consequence, the hire rates may vary from year
	to year. The market is mainly dependent upon two factors: the supply of vessels and the overall growth in the world economy. The general supply of vessels is impacted by the combination of newbuilds, demolition activity of older vessels and
	legislation that limits the use of older vessels or new standards for vessels used in specific trades.

	The Partnership has not presented segment information as it considers its operations to occur in one reportable segment, the
	shuttle tanker market. At December&nbsp;31, 2015, the Partnership&#146;s fleet operated under six time charters and four bareboat charters. At December&nbsp;31, 2014, the Partnership&#146;s fleet operated under five time charters and three bareboat
	charters, and during 2013 the Partnership&#146;s fleet operated under three time charters and two bareboat charters. See Note 5&#151;Significant Risks and Uncertainties Including Business and Credit Concentrations for revenues from customers
	accounting for over 10&nbsp;% of the Partnership&#146;s consolidated and combined revenue. In both time charters and bareboat charters, the charterer, not the Partnership, controls the choice of which trading areas the Vessels will serve.
	Accordingly, the Partnership&#146;s management, including the chief operating decision makers, does not evaluate performance according to geographical region.

	8) Goodwill Impairment Charge
</B>
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	During the three months ended June&nbsp;30, 2015, the Partnership concluded that indicators of impairment were present due
	to a significant reduction in the price of the Partnership&#146;s common units during the quarter. Consequently, the Partnership performed an interim vessel and goodwill impairment analysis as of June&nbsp;30, 2015 on its fleet, concluding that
	there was no impairment to the vessels&#146; values. However, the Partnership determined that the carrying value of the goodwill exceeded its fair value. The impairment charge relates mainly to capitalized goodwill which arose in 2008 when the
	Partnership&#146;s predecessor acquired the
<I>
	Windsor Knutsen
</I>
	and three other vessels then under construction, in a transaction that was then accounted for as a step transaction. As a result, a goodwill impairment charge of $6.2 million was
	recognized for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2015. The fair value was determined using the present value of the expected future cash flows discounted at a rate equivalent to a market participant&#146;s weighted average cost of capital. The
	estimates and assumptions regarding expected future cash flows and appropriate discount rates are in part based upon existing contracts, future shuttle tanker rates, historical experience, financial forecasts and industry trends and conditions. This
	non-cash impairment charge, which does not affect the Partnership&#146;s operations, cash flows, liquidity, or any of its loan covenants, reduced the Partnership&#146;s remaining goodwill balance to zero as of June&nbsp;30, 2015 and
	December&nbsp;31, 2015.

	The consolidated and combined carve-out financial statements include the results of interest rate swap contracts to manage the
	Partnership&#146;s exposure related to changes in interest rates on its variable rate debt instruments and the results of foreign exchange forward contracts to manage its exposure related to changes in currency exchange rates on its operating
	expenses, mainly crew expenses, in other currency than USD and on its contract obligations. The Partnership does not apply hedge accounting for derivative instruments. The Partnership does not speculate using derivative instruments.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	By using derivative financial instruments to economically hedge exposures to changes in interest rates, the Partnership exposes itself to
	credit risk and market risk. Derivative instruments that economically hedge exposures are used for risk management purposes, but these instruments are not designated as hedges for accounting purposes. Credit risk is the failure of the counterparty
	to perform under the terms of the derivative instrument. When the fair value of a derivative instrument is positive, the counterparty owes the Partnership, which creates credit risk for the Partnership. When the fair value of a derivative instrument
	is negative, the Partnership owes the counterparty, and, therefore, the Partnership is not exposed to the counterparty&#146;s credit risk in those circumstances. The Partnership minimizes counterparty credit risk in derivative instruments by
	entering into transactions with major banking and financial institutions. The derivative instruments entered into by the Partnership do not contain credit risk-related contingent features. The Partnership has not entered into master netting
	agreements with the counterparties to its derivative financial instrument contracts.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Market risk is the adverse effect on the value of a
	derivative instrument that results from a change in interest rates, currency exchange rates or commodity prices. The market risk associated with interest rate contracts is managed by establishing and monitoring parameters that limit the types and
	degree of market risk that may be undertaken.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The Partnership assesses interest rate risk by monitoring changes in interest rate
	exposures that may adversely impact expected future cash flows and by evaluating economical hedging opportunities.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The Partnership has
	historically used variable interest rate mortgage debt to finance its vessel construction or conversions. The variable interest rate mortgage debt obligations expose the Partnership to variability in interest payments due to changes in interest
	rates. The Partnership believes that it is prudent to limit the variability of a portion of its interest payments. To meet this objective, the Partnership entered into London Interbank Offered Rate (&#147;LIBOR&#148;)-based interest rate swap
	contracts to manage fluctuations in cash flows resulting from changes in the benchmark interest rate of LIBOR. These swaps change the variable rate cash flow exposure on the mortgage debt obligations to fixed cash flows. Under the terms of the
	interest rate swap contracts, the Partnership receives LIBOR-based variable interest rate payments and makes fixed interest rate payments, thereby creating the equivalent of fixed rate debt for the notional amount of its debt hedged.

	All interest rate swap contracts entered into in conjunction with the individual vessel
	financings prior to the closing date of the IPO have been carved out, as they were readily separable and identifiable within the books of KNOT. Additionally, all these interest rate swap contracts have been retained by KNOT and have not been
	transferred to the Partnership. Therefore, such interest rate swap contracts have been eliminated from the Partnership&#146;s opening equity position as of April&nbsp;16, 2013. See Consolidated and Combined Carve-Out Statements of Changes in
	Partners&#146; Capital/Owners&#146; Capital and Note 2(a)&#151;Summary of Significant Accounting Policies&#151;Basis of Preparation.

	As
	of December&nbsp;31, 2015 and 2014, the total notional amount of the Partnership&#146;s outstanding interest rate swap contracts that were entered into in order to hedge outstanding or forecasted debt obligations were $410.0 million and $382.3
	million, respectively. As of December&nbsp;31, 2015 and 2014 the carrying amount of the interest rate swaps contracts were net liabilities of $3.6 million and $1.7 million, respectively. See Note 11&#151;Fair Value Measurements.

	The Partnership and its subsidiaries utilize the U.S.&nbsp;Dollar as their
	functional and reporting currency, because all of their revenues and the majority of their expenditures, including the majority of their investments in vessels and their financing transactions, are denominated in U.S. Dollars. The Partnership&#146;s
	predecessor also from time to time contracted vessels with contractual obligations to pay the yards in currencies other than the U.S. Dollar. Payment obligations in currencies other than the U.S.&nbsp;Dollar, and in particular operating expenses in
	NOK, expose the Partnership to variability in currency exchange rates. The Partnership believes that it is prudent to limit the variability of a portion of its currency exchange exposure. To meet this objective, the Partnership entered into foreign
	exchange forward contracts to manage fluctuations in cash flows resulting from changes in the exchange rates towards the U.S. Dollar. The agreements change the variable exchange rate to fixed exchange rates at agreed dates.

	where there is little, if any, market activity for the asset or liability at the measurement date, the fair value measurement reflects the Partnership&#146;s own judgment about the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset

	Long-term debt
</I>
	: With respect to long-term debt measurements, the Partnership uses market interest rates and adjusts that rate for all necessary risks, including its own credit risk. In determining an appropriate
	spread to reflect its credit standing, the Partnership considered interest rates currently offered to the KNOT Group for similar debt instruments of comparable maturities by KNOT&#146;s and the Partnership&#146;s bankers as well as other banks that
	regularly compete to provide financing to the Partnership. As all long-term debt has been recently refinanced, the fair value is based on the margin obtained in the refinancing and therefore the fair value equals the carrying value as of

	Prior to the closing of the IPO, existing vessel financing agreements were amended to permit the transactions pursuant to
	which the Partnership acquired its initial fleet at the closing of the IPO and to establish a $20.0 million revolving credit facility.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The Partnership used the net proceeds from the IPO to repay either a portion of the amounts outstanding or the full amount outstanding under
	the existing loan facilities. All amended loan agreements have been assessed for debt extinguishment or debt modifications in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 470,
<I>
	Debt
</I>
	. Debt that has been fully repaid has been
	accounted for as debt extinguishment, i.e., for all extinguishments of debt, the difference between the reacquisition price (which includes any premium) and the net carrying amount of the debt being extinguished (which includes any deferred debt
	issuance costs) has been recognized as a gain or loss when the debt was extinguished.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	In June 2014, the Partnership entered into two new
	senior secured credit facilities in order to refinance its existing long term bank debt. The new senior secured credit facilities consist of a $20 million revolving credit facility and two term loans of $220 million and $140 million. The $220
	million term loan and the $20 million revolving facility were drawn in June 2014 to repay existing debt under a $120 million loan facility, a $85 million loan facility and a $93 million loan facility secured by the
<I>
	Bodil&nbsp;Knutsen
</I>
	, the
<I>
	Windsor Knutsen
</I>
	and the
<I>
	Carmen Knutsen
</I>
	, respectively, and a seller&#146;s credit from KNOT. The new $140 million term loan was drawn in November 2014 and replaced the $160 million loan facility secured by the
<I>
	Fortaleza Knutsen
</I>
	and the
<I>
	Recife Knutsen
</I>
	. The repayments of the loan facilities in 2014 have been assessed for debt extinguishment or debt modifications in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 470,
<I>
	Debt
</I>
	. These repayments were
	accounted for as debt extinguishment and $1.8 million has been written off from deferred financing fees and expenses under interest expense for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2014.

	The Partnership records a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that
	some or all of the benefit from the deferred tax asset will not be realized. The valuation allowances were $10.3 million and $9.1 million respectively, as of December&nbsp;31, 2015 and 2014. The valuation allowances relate to the financial loss
	carry forwards and other deferred tax assets for tonnage tax that, in the judgment of the Partnership, are more-likely-than not to be realized reflecting the Partnership&#146;s cumulative loss position for tonnage tax. In assessing the realizability
	of deferred tax assets, the Partnership considers whether it is more-likely-than-not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized taking into account all the positive and negative evidence available. As of
	December&nbsp;31, 2014, the Partnership determined that the deferred tax assets are likely to not be realized, and the booked value was, therefore, zero.

	After the reorganization of the Partnership&#146;s predecessor&#146;s activities into the new group structure in February 2013, all profit
	from continuing operations in Norway is taxable within the tonnage tax regime. The consequence of the reorganization is a one-time entrance tax into the Norwegian tonnage tax regime due to the Partnership&#146;s acquisition of the shares in the
	subsidiary that owns the
<I>
	Fortaleza Knutsen
</I>
	and the
<I>
	Recife Knutsen
</I>
	. The total amount of the entrance tax was estimated to be approximately $3.0 million, which was recognized in the three months ended March&nbsp;31, 2013. The entrance
	tax on this gain is payable over several years and is calculated by multiplying the Norwegian tax rate by the declining balance of the gain, which will decline by 20% each year. The Norwegian corporate tax rate was reduced from 28% in 2013 to 27% in
	2014 and 2015 and will be 25% effective as of January&nbsp;1, 2016. The entrance tax had declined to approximately $2.7 million at December&nbsp;31, 2013 due to translation effects and tax rate changes and at December&nbsp;31, 2014 the entrance tax
	had declined to approximately $1.8 million due to paid entrance tax, change in tax rate and translation effects. At December&nbsp;31, 2015 the entrance tax had declined to approximately $1.1 million due to paid entrance tax, change in tax rate and
	translation effects The taxes payable, mainly related to the entrance tax, are calculated based on a tax rate of 27% for 2015, and the deferred tax liabilities, also mainly related to the entrance tax, are calculated based on a tax rate of 25%
	effective as from January&nbsp;1, 2016. Income tax expense within the UK of $11,000 and $15,000 for 2015 and 2014, respectively, was calculated by multiplying the tax basis with the UK tax rate of 20%.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	In 2013, the total entrance tax was estimated at $2.7 million of which approximately $0.6 million was estimated to be payable during 2014. In
	addition, ordinary tonnage taxes payable were estimated at $0.1 million. Total income taxes payable were estimated at $0.7 million as of December&nbsp;31, 2013 and equaled taxes paid in 2014. As of December&nbsp;31, 2014, the total income taxes
	payable were estimated to be $0.4 million and consisted of payable entrance tax and ordinary UK corporation tax. As of December&nbsp;31, 2015, the total income taxes payable are estimated to be $0.2 million and consist of payable entrance tax and
	ordinary UK corporation tax.

	Approximately $0.6 million of the estimated entrance tax of $2.7 million as of December&nbsp;31, 2013 was
	paid during 2014. Approximately $0.3 million of the estimated entrance tax of $1.8 million as of December&nbsp;31, 2014 was paid during 2015. Approximately $0.2 million of the estimated entrance tax of $1.1 million is estimated to be payable in the
	first and second quarter of 2016 and is presented as income taxes payable, while $0.9 million is presented as non-current deferred taxes payable.

	guaranteed the obligations of the Partnership&#146;s subsidiaries directly under the vessel financing agreements. Therefore, after the IPO, the Partnership did not incur any guarantee commissions to KNOT and TSSI.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Under the loss of hire policies, the insurer will pay a compensation for the lost hire rate agreed in respect of each Vessel for each day, in
	excess of 14 deductible days, for the time that the Vessel is out of service as a result of damage, for a maximum of 180 days. In addition, the Partnership maintains protection and indemnity insurance, which covers third-party legal liabilities
	arising in connection with the Vessels&#146; activities, including, among other things, the injury or death of third-party persons, loss or damage to cargo, claims arising from collisions with other vessels and other damage to other third-party
	property, including pollution arising from oil or other substances. This insurance is unlimited, except for pollution, which is limited to $1 billion per vessel per incident. The protection and indemnity insurance is maintained through a protection
	and indemnity association, and as a member of the association, the Partnership may be required to pay amounts above budgeted premiums if the member claims exceed association reserves, subject to certain reinsured amounts. If the Partnership
	experiences multiple claims each with individual deductibles, losses due to risks that are not insured or claims for insured risks that are not paid, it could have a material adverse effect on the Partnership&#146;s results of operations and
	financial condition.

	income was distributed according to the terms of the Partnership Agreement, regardless of whether those earnings would or could be distributed. The Partnership Agreement does not provide for the distribution of net income. Rather, it provides for
	the distribution of available cash, which is a contractually defined term that generally means all cash on hand at the end of each quarter less the amount of cash reserves established by the Partnership&#146;s board of directors to provide for the
	proper conduct of the Partnership&#146;s business, including reserves for maintenance and replacement capital expenditures and anticipated capital requirements. In addition, KNOT, as the initial holder of all IDRs, has the right, at the time when
	there are no subordinated units outstanding and it has received incentive distributions at the highest level to which it is entitled (48.0% for each of the prior four consecutive fiscal quarters), to reset the initial cash target distribution levels
	at higher levels based on the distribution at the time of the exercise of the reset election. Unlike available cash, net income is affected by non-cash items, such as depreciation and amortization, unrealized gains and losses on derivative
