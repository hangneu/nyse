GENERAL DEVELOPMENT OF BUSINESS
</SPAN>
</P>
<EFX_BUSINESS_STOCK_REPORT>
<A NAME="FIS_BUSINESS_STOCK_REPORT"></A>
<P>
Stillwater  Mining Company (the  &quot;Company&quot;) is engaged in the  exploration,
development,  mining and production of platinum, palladium and associated metals
from the Stillwater  Complex in southern Montana,  which the Company believes is
the only  significant  primary  source of  platinum  and  palladium  outside the
Republic  of  South  Africa.   The  Stillwater  Complex  includes  an  extensive
mineralized zone containing platinum group metals (&quot;PGMs&quot;) known as the J-M Reef
which has been traced on surface for  approximately  28 miles and which  extends
downward  over one mile to  unknown  depths.  The  Stillwater  Complex  has been
prospected  for gold,  copper,  nickel and  chromium  since the late 1880s.  The
Company  currently owns or has the rights to 995 claims  covering  substantially
all of the presently identified PGM mineralized zone.
</P>
<P>
The  Company  began  mining  operations  in 1986 with an  underground  mine
located in the Stillwater  Valley. The Stillwater Mine currently accesses only a
small  segment  of the ore  body  approximately  five  miles  long  between  the
elevations of 6,700 and 3,100 feet above sea level.  The physical  configuration
of the J-M Reef with its 50 degree to 90 degree dip and  relatively  wide mining
widths in comparison with South Africa's  Bushveld  Complex makes it amenable to
various gravity assisted,  mechanized mining methods.  At December 31, 1996, the
Stillwater  Mine had 31 active  stopes,  all of which are accessed by horizontal
adits and drifts.  At December  31,  1996,  the Company had proven and  probable
reserves of  approximately  27.1  million  tons of ore with  approximately  21.6
million  contained  ounces of platinum  and  palladium  (or  approximately  10.1
million  total gold  equivalent  ounces) in a ratio of  approximately  3.5 parts
palladium to one part  platinum.  In 1996,  the Company  produced  approximately
59,000  ounces of platinum  and 196,000  ounces of palladium  (or  approximately
127,000 total gold equivalent ounces) from mining and processing 446,000 tons of
ore at its one developed underground mine.
</P>
<P>
As part of the Company's  long-term  strategy to expand its  operations and
improve its operating economics, in 1994 the Company undertook an expansion plan
(the &quot;Expansion  Plan&quot;)  designed to  significantly  increase  production at the
Stillwater Mine and associated processing facilities.  The Company has completed

&quot;Expansion Plan.&quot;

BACKGROUND
</SPAN>
</P>
<P>
Platinum  and  palladium  were  discovered  in the  Stillwater  Complex  by
Manville  Corporation  geologists in the early 1970s.  In 1979,  Manville Mining
Company (&quot;Manville&quot;),  a wholly-owned subsidiary of Manville Corporation,  since
renamed  Schuller  Corporation  (&quot;Schuller&quot;),   entered  into  a  joint  venture
agreement with Chevron U.S.A. Inc. (&quot;Chevron&quot;) to develop PGMs discovered in the
Stillwater Complex,  forming the Stillwater PGM Resources  partnership (&quot;SPGMR&quot;)
which leased from Manville all its claims held in the Stillwater  area. In 1984,
Chevron and Manville  entered into the  Stillwater  Mining  Company  partnership
(&quot;SMC&quot;) with Anaconda Minerals, Inc. (&quot;Anaconda&quot;) covering a 30,000 foot section
traversing  the  Stillwater  Valley  towards the  eastern end of the  Stillwater
Complex. Each partner owned an undivided one-third interest in this partnership.
In 1986,  Anaconda  sold its  one-third  interest  in SMC to LAC  Minerals  Ltd.
(&quot;LAC&quot;),  and in late 1988,  LAC sold its interest back to Chevron and Manville,
each  company  taking half of LAC's  one-third  interest,  which  brought  their
respective ownership up to a 50% interest in both partnerships.
</P>
<P>
In 1992, the Company was incorporated as a Delaware  corporation,  and as of
October 1, 1993,  Chevron and  Manville  transferred  substantially  all assets,
liabilities and operations of SPGMR and SMC to the new Company.  The Company was
formed to continue the exploration,  development,  mining and production of PGMs
from the Stillwater Complex and to become an independently operated and financed
entity.  On  September  16,  1994,  the Company  redeemed  Chevron's  entire 50%
ownership  interest  for $44  million,  the  funding  for which was  raised in a
private  placement of 7,500,000  shares of common stock at $5.87 per share and a
$25 million subordinated credit facility with warrants.  The credit facility was
terminated  and the warrants were  exercised  upon the Company's  initial public
offering of common  stock  which  closed on December  22,  1994.  In the initial
public  offering,  the Company  received net proceeds of $53.7  million from the
sale of 4,500,000  shares of common stock at $13 per share.  Manville  also sold
2,112,500  shares  in  the  initial  public  offering,  reducing  its  ownership
percentage to approximately  27% of the issued and outstanding  common stock. On
August 23, 1995,  Manville sold its remaining  ownership interest in the Company
to a group of institutional  investors.  See Item 13, &quot;Certain Relationships and
Related Transactions.&quot;
</P>
<P>
On April  29,  1996 the  Company  sold $50  million  of its 7%  Convertible
Subordinated Notes Due 2003 (the &quot;Convertible Notes&quot;),  maturing on May 1, 2003.
On May 14, 1996, the initial purchaser  exercised its over-allotment  option and
purchased an additional  $1.45 million of  Convertible  Notes.  The  Convertible
Notes are unsecured,  subordinated  obligations.  As of December 31, 1996, $51.5
million is classified as long-term debt.

<HR CLASS="eolPageBreak">
<DIV CLASS="eolNewPage"></DIV>
<A NAME="eolPage5"></A>
<P>
The  Convertible  Notes  will be  redeemable,  in whole or in part,  at the
option of the Company  beginning on May 1, 1999. The  Convertible  Notes will be
convertible,  subject to prior redemption,  at the option of holders at any time
after 90 days  following  the date of original  issuance  and prior to maturity,
into shares of the  Company's  stock at a conversion  price of $26.80 per share,
subject to adjustment in certain events.
</P>
<P>
In connection with the offering of the Convertible  Notes,  the Company has
filed a shelf  registration  statement on Form S-3 under the  Securities  Act of
1933, as amended, relating to the resale of the Convertible Notes and the common
stock issuable upon conversion.  This registration was declared effective by the
Securities and Exchange Commission on December 19, 1996.

GEOLOGY OF THE STILLWATER COMPLEX
</SPAN>
</P>
<P>
The  Stillwater  Complex is located in the Beartooth  Mountains in southern
Montana.  It is situated along the northern edge of the Beartooth  Plateau which
rises to  elevations  of over 10,000  feet in places  within the  complex.  This
plateau is deeply  dissected by several rivers and their  tributaries  including
the  Stillwater  River  towards the  eastern end and the Boulder  River near the
western end of the complex. Both of these rivers have eroded their valley floors
resulting in deep valleys cut into the gently undulating elevated plateau.
</P>
<P>
Geologically,  the Stillwater Complex is composed of an assemblage of basic
and ultrabasic rocks derived from a single, large, buried magma body emplaced an
estimated 2.7 billion years ago. The molten rock was  sufficiently  fluid at the
time of emplacement to allow  individual  minerals to crystallize  sequentially,
the heavier,  more basic, darker minerals  crystallizing  first, sinking towards
the bottom, and leaving the lighter,  more siliceous  light-colored  minerals to
crystallize out later to produce bands of norite,  gabbro and anorthosite  which
can be traced  across most of the strike  length of the  complex.  Over time the
original  horizontal  orientation  of the complex was changed as the complex was
tilted at an angle of 50 to 90 degrees to the  north.  The upper  portion of the
complex was eroded away to produce the essentially lenticular-shaped exposure of
the  complex  evident  today  which  has  been  identified  for 28  miles  in an
east-southeasterly  direction  and has a maximum  width of nearly 4.5 miles near
the East Boulder valley.
</P>
<P>
The PGMs,  together  with small  amounts of  nickel,  copper and gold,  are
concentrated in one principal layer of the complex  referred to as the J-M Reef.
This reef appears to form a  continuous  layer which is exposed from the highest
ridges  over  9,500 feet above sea level to the  deepest  valleys  almost a mile
below. The zone of  mineralization  has also been intersected in a drill hole at
an elevation  of 3,020 feet above sea level  demonstrating  vertical  continuity
exceeding  6,000 feet.  Geological and  geophysical  evidence  suggests that the
complex and the enclosed J-M Reef extend downward beyond the limits of currently
available mining practice.  Geological  mapping and gravity surveys also suggest
that the dip of the  complex and the J-M Reef  flatten  gently and may extend 30
miles or more to the north.
</P>
<DIV CLASS="eolCenter">

</DIV>
<HR CLASS="eolPageBreak">
<DIV CLASS="eolNewPage"></DIV>
<A NAME="eolPage6"></A>
<P>
The Stillwater  Complex is similar to South Africa's Bushveld Complex which
contains the well-known  platiniferous Merensky Reef which is currently mined in
many localities.  The in situ PGM grade of the J-M Reef is significantly  higher
than that of the  Merensky  Reef and its  economically  recoverable  portion  is
significantly thicker, making the J-M Reef generally amenable to a wider variety
of gravity assisted,  mechanized mining methods. The Merensky Reef, however, has
a  substantially  longer  surface  strike  length  compared to the known 28-mile
strike length of the Stillwater Complex.
</P>
<P>
The Company  believes that the J-M Reef  constitutes  a qualifying  lode or
vein for purposes of the General  Mining Law of 1872,  as amended (the  &quot;General
Mining Law&quot;), but is not aware of any  administrative or legal  determination on
this point.  The Company is not relying  solely on down dip (or  &quot;extralateral&quot;)
rights to secure  possession of the J-M Reef, but also owns or has the rights to
mining  claims  vertically  overlying  the  portions of the down dip  extensions
needed for mining in the foreseeable future.
</P>
<P CLASS="eolCenter">
<SPAN STYLE="font-weight: bold">
MINING CLAIMS
</SPAN>
</P>
<P>
The Company now owns or has the rights to 995 claims covering approximately
16,000 acres. The Company believes that  approximately 130 of these claims cover
100% of the known apex of the J-M Reef.
</P>
<P>
Applications  for patents  covering 172 of these claims for a total area of
2,876.9  acres have been  submitted.  Patents to 34 claims  covering  an area of
574.8 acres have been granted;  138 claims covering 2,302.1 acres have had first
half final  certificates  issued.  The Company is currently in negotiations with
the U.S.  Forest  Service (USFS) to ensure the allocation of personnel and other
resources required for the USFS to complete the patent documentation  process on
the 138 claims  which have first half final  certificates  issued.  The  Company
expects that this process will take two years to complete. The patents will then
undergo  several  levels of review  within the U.S.  Department  of the Interior
before  submission to the Secretary for signature.  Another Company claim leased
from the Mouat family and acquired through the agreement with Anaconda Minerals,
Inc.   (&quot;Anaconda&quot;)  was  patented  many  years  ago.  The  Company's  remaining
controlled  claims  either  adjoin the apex of the J-M Reef or provide sites for
surface operations.
</P>
<P>
Of the  Company's  995  controlled  claims,  869 are subject to  royalties,
including 711 subject to a 5% net smelter  royalty  payable to Manville,  56 are
subject to a 0.35% net smelter royalty payable to the Mouat family,  and 102 are

<P>
The  following  table sets forth the  Company's  total  proven and probable
platinum and palladium ore reserves and platinum and gold equivalent reserves as
of  December  31, 1996 and 1995.  The  reserves  reflected  below are based on a
cut-off grade of 0.60 ounces of platinum and palladium per ton for  cut-and-fill
stopes and 0.40 ounces per ton for certain  sub-level  mining  areas and assumed
prices  per ounce of $376 and $125 for  platinum  and  palladium,  respectively.
Proven and probable  reserves  include an average mining dilution of 10% at zero
grade based on actual mining experience. The December 31, 1995 ore reserves were
affirmed  and  verified  by Behre  Dolbear &amp; Company,  Inc.  (&quot;Behre  Dolbear&quot;),
independent  consultants,  who are  experts in mining,  geology  and ore reserve
determination.  The Company has utilized the firm of Behre  Dolbear to carry out
independent  reviews and  inventories  of the  Company's  mineral  reserves  and
resources  since 1990.  The ore  reserves  are  affirmed  and  verified by Behre
Dolbear in alternating years. The December 31, 1996 proven and probable platinum
and palladium ore reserves, although not independently verified by Behre Dolbear
in 1996, were  determined by the same technical  methods and criteria which were
previously reviewed and verified by Behre Dolbear.

Mining reserve is that part of a mineral  deposit that can be  economically
and  legally  extracted  or  produced  at  the  time  of  determination  and  is
customarily  stated  in  terms of  &quot;ore&quot;  when  dealing  with  metals.  The term
&quot;economic&quot;   implies  that   profitable   extraction  or  production   has  been
established, analytically demonstrated or assumed with reasonable certainty. The
term need not signify that extraction facilities are in place and operative. The
mining reserve is determined  after the  application of a cut-off grade which is
derived from consideration of the method and cost of production, the recovery in
processing and the sales price of the resultant commodities.  To reflect varying
degrees of geologic  certainty,  mining  reserves are subdivided into proven and
probable.  The proven quantity is computed from dimensions  revealed in workings
or drill  holes;  grade or  quality is  computed  from the  results of  detailed
sampling.  The sites for  inspection,  sampling  and  measurement  are spaced at
intervals of 25 to 50 feet, and the geologic  character is so defined,  that the
size,  shape,  depth and mineral content of the reserve blocks are  established.
The probable quantity and grade or quality are computed from information similar
to that used for proven  reserves,  but the sites for  inspection,  sampling and
measurement  are  between 50 and 1,000  feet  apart.  The  degree of  assurance,
although  lower than that for proven  reserves,  is  sufficient  to predict  the
geological  regularity  of  the  reef  between  points  of  observation.  At the
Stillwater  Mine, the sites of  measurement  are laterally no greater than 1,000
feet apart,  and the reserve is  extended  vertically  to a maximum of twice the
depth of any particular data point. The  categorization  of probable reserves is
based on the  geologic  character of the deposit,  the apparent  regularity  and
overall general predictability of economic mineralization, and the demonstration
that  drilling  at  intervals  more  widely  spaced  than  those  used  for  the
determination  of proven  reserves  provides a reasonable  prediction  of mining
results.  See Item 7,  &quot;Factors  That May Affect  Future  Results and  Financial
Condition&quot; at pages 32-37.
</P>
<P>
Reserves are consumed during mining  operations and are generally  replaced
by development from mineralized material which has been identified  geologically
but not yet raised to the level of proven and probable mining reserves.  Because
of the expense of the close-spaced  drilling necessary to generate proven mining
reserve estimates,  the Company attempts to prove up only sufficient reserves to
support its mine development objective of approximately 18 months of production.

MINING
</SPAN>
</P>
<P>
The  Company's   current  mining   operations  are  confined  to  a  single
underground  mine located within the  Stillwater  Complex.  The Stillwater  Mine
accesses  only a small segment of the J-M Reef,  approximately  five miles long,
between the  elevations  of 6,700 and 3,100 feet above sea level.  Access to the
ore at the  Stillwater  Mine is by means of  horizontal  adits and drifts driven
parallel to the strike of the J-M Reef at vertical  intervals of about 200 feet.
</P>
<DIV CLASS="eolCenter">
6
</DIV>
<HR CLASS="eolPageBreak">
<DIV CLASS="eolNewPage"></DIV>
<A NAME="eolPage9"></A>
<P>
The  adits  have  been  driven  from the  surface  in the  Stillwater  Valley at
elevations  of 5,000  feet  above  sea  level or more.  Four  drifts  have  been
developed below the valley floor by ramping down from the 5,000 level to extract
ore  from  the  reef  down to the  4,200  foot  elevation.  As a  result  of the
commissioning of a 1,950-foot  vertical shaft in 1996,  development has begun on
two new  drifts at 3,200 and 3,800  feet  above sea  level.  In  addition,  deep
exploration  drill holes from the current  workings have confirmed the structure
and mineralization of the J-M Reef down at the 3,020-foot elevation.
</P>
<P>
Prior to 1994,  almost all of the  Company's  stoping  activities  utilized
&quot;cut-and-fill&quot;  extraction  methods  to remove  ore from the mine.  This  method
extracts  the ore body in a succession  of ten-foot  high  horizontal  slices or
cuts.  The open space created by the extraction of each cut is filled with waste
rock and coarse  concentrator  tailings and becomes the floor for the next level
of mining as the process moves upward.  Since 1994,  the Company has  introduced
two mechanized  mining methods called  &quot;sub-level&quot; and  &quot;ramp-and-fill&quot;  stoping
which  the  Company  believes  are  safer and less  expensive  than  traditional
&quot;cut-and-fill&quot; stoping.
</P>
<P>
Currently,  most of the  production  from  above  the  5,000-foot  level is
transferred  through various raise systems to the 5,000-foot level and hauled by
train to the surface.  Production from below the 5,000-foot level is transported
to the surface by 15-ton  underground  trucks.  Waste, which cannot be stored in
underground  excavations,  is hauled to the  surface  and used to  increase  the
height of the rock  embankment  of the  tailings  dam or is  destined  for other
surface  disposal.  During  1996,  development  on the  east  side  of the  mine
encountered  more  structurally  complex  conditions than had been  anticipated.
Accordingly,  development  was  switched  to the west  side of the mine to known
areas of high development yields.  However,  this concentration of mining on the
west side of the mine lead to hauling and ore/waste storage inefficiencies which
were reflected in third quarter 1996 head grade dilution.  In December 1996, the
Company commissioned a waste transfer raise between the 4,400-foot elevation and
the shaft loading station.  This raise allows waste which was previously trucked
to surface to be hoisted up the shaft. When the shaft ore/waste  handling system
is fully  commissioned,  presently scheduled for April 1997, all ore mined below
the  5,000-foot  elevation  on the west side of the  Stillwater  valley  will be
hoisted to the surface and  delivered  directly to the ore storage silo near the
concentrator.  West  side  ore  from  above  the  5,000-foot  elevation  will be
transported to the shaft system in late 1997. The Company  anticipates that this
new shaft system will improve  efficiency and reduce  operating  costs.  Ore and
waste from the east side of the mine will  continue  to be hauled to the surface
by 15-ton  trucks  until the east side is connected to the shaft by a horizontal
adit under the Stillwater River.
</P>
<P>
The Company has a large fleet of mobile mining  equipment,  the majority of
which was replaced in 1995 and 1996. In conjunction  with the acquisition of the
new  equipment  the  Company  undertook   several   initiatives  to  reduce  its
maintenance  costs,  including a reduction  in the variety of sizes and types of

formation of an additional  maintenance crew to permit maintenance activities to
be carried out on a 24 hour,  seven day per week  basis,  and  development  of a
computerized system for scheduled maintenance.
</P>
<P>
<SPAN STYLE="font-weight: bold">
CONCENTRATION
</SPAN>
</P>
<P>
The  Company  maintains  a  concentrator  plant  directly  adjacent  to the
Stillwater Mine which performs the initial processing of the ore that is removed
from the mine. Ore is fed into the concentrator,  mixed with water and ground to
a slurry in a mill circuit to liberate the PGM-bearing sulfide minerals from the
rock matrix.  Various  reagents are added to the slurry to separate the valuable
sulfides from the waste rock in a flotation  circuit.  In the flotation  circuit
the sulfide minerals are floated, recycled,  reground and refloated to produce a
concentrate suitable for further processing.  The flotation  concentrate,  which
represents  approximately 1% of the original ore weight, is filtered,  dried and
transported  in  trailers  approximately  46 miles to the  Company's  smelter in
Columbus.  Approximately  sixty percent of the residue from this process is used
for  backfill  in the  mine  with  the  balance  stored  in an  onsite  tailings
containment  area. The Company worked throughout 1996 to bring the new flotation
circuit  recovery  performance  up to an  acceptable  level.  These  efforts are
continuing during the first quarter of 1997 with significant assistance from the
flotation cell designer and manufacturer.
</P>
<P>
<SPAN STYLE="font-weight: bold">
SMELTING
</SPAN>
</P>
<P>
The  flotation  concentrate  is  fed  to a  15  megawatt  electric  furnace
(&quot;Furnace&quot;)  at the Company's  smelter  where it is melted and separated  into a
silica  oxide rich slag and a PGM rich  matte.  The slag is drained  through the
side of the  Furnace,  cooled and  provided  to outside  parties for use as road
base.
</P>
<P>
The Furnace  matte is remelted  in one of two top blown  rotary  converters
(&quot;TBRC&quot;)  which  separates  iron from the PGMs.  The converter  matte,  or white
metal,  is poured from the TBRC,  granulated and  transferred to the base metals
refinery  (&quot;BMR&quot;).  The white metal,  approximately  10% of the original smelter
feed weight, is primarily copper and nickel sulfides containing approximately 2%
PGMs.
</P>
<P>
The gases  released  from the  smelting  operations  are  routed  through a
gas/liquid  scrubbing system,  which removes  approximately  99.8% of the sulfur
dioxide.  Used scrubbing  solution is treated in a closed-loop  chemical process
that  converts  the sulfur  dioxide to gypsum and  regenerates  clean  scrubbing
solution. The gypsum is used by local farmers as a soil amendment.

In 1996,  the  Company  successfully  constructed  and  commissioned  a BMR
adjacent to the precious metals smelter in Columbus,  Montana.  The BMR utilizes
the patented  Sherritt  Process,  whereby  sulfuric acid is used to dissolve the
nickel and copper  from the smelter  white  metal.  This  process  upgrades  the

smelter  product over 25 times (from 2% Pt+Pd to 55% Pt+Pd).  The  resulting PGM
rich filter cake is shipped for toll refining by either Union Miniere  (&quot;UM&quot;) in
Belgium,  or Johnson  Matthey  (&quot;JM&quot;) in New Jersey.  The  dissolved  nickel and
copper is shipped, as a sulfate solution, and sold for its nickel value.
</P>
<P>
The BMR has a capacity equivalent to 4,000 tons per day of mine production.
The present  plant is operated  one shift per day,  five days per week.  As mine
production  is ramped up, the BMR will increase  throughput by adding  operating
shifts to achieve the most cost effective schedule.
</P>
<P>
<SPAN STYLE="font-weight: bold">
REFINING
</SPAN>
</P>
<P>
Since May 1996,  the  Company  has  contracted  with both UM and JM to toll
refine the filter cake from its BMR.  The filter cake is shipped via air freight
to Hoboken, Belgium and West Deptford, New Jersey and is returned to the account
of the Company 20 days (UM), or 35 days (JM),  after  receipt as 99.95%  sponge.
Currently,  the Company is shipping  approximately  90% of its filter cake to UM
and  approximately 10% to JM. These percentages are expected to change to 70% UM
and 30% JM in  July,  1997  and  should  remain  at  these  levels  through  the
expiration of the refining  contracts in 2001. The Company pays both UM and JM a
fixed  refining  charge  in  United  States  dollars  per  ounce of  payable  or
returnable   metal  for  the  toll  processing  of  the  BMR  filter  cake.  The
nickel/copper  solution  from  the  BMR is  shipped  via  truck  to the  Westaim
(formerly  Sherritt)  facilities in Fort Saskatchewan,  Alberta.  The Company is
paid for 97% of the nickel  content of the solution  with the  remaining  values
kept by Westaim as their processing fee.
</P>
<P>
<SPAN STYLE="font-weight: bold">
SECONDARY MATERIALS PROCESSING
</SPAN>
</P>
<P>
With the economics provided by the BMR and the new refining contracts,  the
Company  believes that it possesses a PGM processing  complex that could process
suitable spent automotive and industrial catalysts at terms competitive with any
other North American processor.
</P>
<P>
In the first  quarter of 1997,  the Company plans to have  constructed  and
commissioned a dedicated  secondary  materials sampling facility.  Current plans
call for the precious metals smelter to begin continuous processing of secondary
materials by the third  quarter of 1997.  At that time,  the Company  expects to
have  capacity  available  to  process  three to five tons per day of  secondary
materials.  The Company  experienced  some unplanned  buildup of platinum in the
smelter during the fourth quarter from processing secondary  materials,  but the
Company  believes that sampling  controls  will allow  corrective  actions to be
taken  to  alleviate  this  problem  in the  future.  However,  there  can be no
assurance that other problems from secondary  materials will not occur from time
to time.

Major  portions  of the J-M Reef have yet to be  exposed  to  drilling  and
development  sufficient to allow for the  delineation  of  additional  reserves.
However,  given the magnitude of its current proven and probable  reserves,  the
Company's exploration  activities in recent years have been limited. The Company
will continue to focus on developing  and bringing into  production  its current
PGM reserves  rather than  exploring  for or  attempting  to acquire  additional
developed  or  undeveloped  ore  reserves.  Consequently,  exploration  does not

<SPAN STYLE="font-weight: bold">
SALES AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES
</SPAN>
</P>
<P>
Platinum,  palladium,  rhodium and gold are sold to a number of dealers and
consumers with whom the Company has established trading  relationships.  Refined
PGMs of  99.95%  purity  in  sponge  form are  transferred  upon  sale  from the
Company's  account  at UM and JM to the  account  of the  purchaser.  By-product
metals are purchased at the average market price by the refiners.
</P>
<P>
The Company  employs a platinum and  palladium  hedging  strategy  with the
objective of mitigating the impact of downturns in PGM prices while  maintaining
the  potential  to benefit from price  upturns.  Hedging  activities  consist of
short-term spot deferred contracts for future deliveries of specific  quantities
of PGMs at specific  prices and the sale of call options and the purchase of put
options.  Most of the Company's  outstanding hedging contracts were satisfied or
expired at the end of 1996. During the first quarter of 1997, the Company placed
significant hedging positions, particularly in palladium, for both 1997 and 1998
sales.  Specifically,  at February 28, 1997,  the Company had 186,500  ounces of
palladium  sold  forward  under spot  deferred  contracts  at $135 per ounce and
37,900 ounces of platinum sold under spot deferred  contracts at $382 per ounce.

SAFETY

<P>
Underground mining can be, by its nature, a hazardous  occupation.  Current
mine operations extend over five miles  horizontally into the Stillwater Complex
and involve the use of heavy  machinery  and  drilling  and blasting in confined
spaces.  The Company's  recent safety  performance has been in line with that of
similar mines in terms of its Lost Time Accident  Rate;  however,  the number of
fatalities over the life of the Stillwater Mine has been unacceptably  high. Six
fatalities have occurred at the Company's mine since  operations  began in 1986,
the latest  occurring in August 1995.  The Company's  Lost Time Accident Rate in
1992 was 12.9.  The Company's  safety  program  resulted in a Lost Time Accident
Rate of 2.8 in 1996.  Management believes that continued  reductions in accident
frequency  are  achievable  and,  if  accomplished,  can  result in a safer work
environment for the Company's employees, as well as resulting in cost savings to
the Company.

contract agreement with the Company, which became effective on July 1, 1996. The
contract has a term of three years and  provides  for a  cumulative  increase in
wages  and  benefits  of 5.86%  over  the  contract  term.  This  agreement  was
negotiated  using an  interest-based  bargaining  approach  that has resulted in
cooperative  and  stable  labor  relations.  Management  believes  its  employee
relations are good and believes its wages,  benefits and working  conditions are
competitive with other mining operations in Montana.
</P>
<P>
The  Company  competes  for  individuals   skilled  in  the  operation  and
development of precious metals mining properties.  The number of such persons is
limited, and significant competition exists to obtain their skills. During 1996,
the Company added a net total of 107 hourly employees to the workforce. However,
additional skilled rockbreakers will be required during 1997 and the Company may
find it  difficult  to attract and retain  sufficient  numbers of these  skilled
individuals to achieve the anticipated production from the Expansion Plan.

of land,  reclamation of disturbed lands,  threatened or endangered  species and
other  environmental  matters.  In particular,  legislation  including,  but not
limited to, the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, the  Endangered  Species Act
and the National  Environmental  Policy Act,  requires  analyses  and/or imposes
effluent standards,  new source performance standards,  air quality and emission
standards and other design or operational  requirements  upon various aspects of
exploration,  mining and processing.  In addition, the Company's existing mining
operations may become subject to additional environmental control and mitigation
requirements  if  applicable  Federal,  state  and  local  laws and  regulations
governing environmental protection,  land use and species protection are amended
or  enforcement  policies  become more  stringent in the future.  The  Company's
activities  may  cause it to be  subject  to  liabilities  in the  future  under
provisions  of  the  Comprehensive  Environmental  Response,   Compensation  and
Liability Act of 1980, as amended (&quot;CERCLA&quot;), and analogous state law. Such laws
impose liability on certain  categories of potentially  responsible  parties for
releases or threatened  releases of hazardous  substances into the  environment,
which may result in the incurrence of cleanup costs.
</P>
<P>
Generally,  compliance with the above  regulations  requires the Company to
obtain permits issued by federal,  state and local regulatory agencies.  Certain
permits  require  periodic  renewal or review of their  conditions.  The Company
cannot predict whether it will be able to renew such permits or whether material
changes in permit  conditions  will be  imposed.  Non-renewal  of permits or the
imposition of additional  conditions could have a material adverse effect on the
Company's financial condition and results of operations.
</P>
<P>
The Company  believes  that its  operations  and  facilities  comply in all
material respects with current federal, state and local permits and regulations.
However,  compliance  with existing and future laws and  regulations may require
additional  control measures and expenditures  which cannot be estimated at this
time.  Compliance  requirements for new mines and mills may require  substantial
additional control measures that could materially affect proposed permitting and
construction  schedules  for  such  facilities.   Under  certain  circumstances,
facility  construction may be delayed pending regulatory  approval.  The cost of
complying  with existing and future laws and  regulations  may render  currently
operating or future  properties less  profitable and could adversely  affect the
level of the  Company's  reserves  and,  in the worst  case,  render  its mining
operations uneconomic.
</P>
<P>
PERMITTING  AND  RECLAMATION.  Operating  Permit  00118  issued  by the  Montana
Department of State Lands encompasses approximately 1,340 acres at the Company's
Stillwater  Mine.  This permit  delineates  lands that may be subject to surface
disturbance. At present, 117 acres have been disturbed, 54 of which are occupied
by the tailings impoundment.  The remaining acreage consists of buildings, roads
and portal sites. The Company employs concurrent  reclamation wherever feasible.
Reclaimed land is removed from the disturbed acreage inventory.

<P>
Reclamation  regulations affecting the Company's operations are promulgated
and enforced by the Hard Rock Bureau of the Montana  Department  of State Lands.
Additional  reclamation  requirements may be imposed by the United States Forest
Service during the permitting process. For regulatory purposes, reclamation does
not mean restoring the land to its pre-mining state. Rather, it is returning the
post-mining  land to a state  which has  stability  and  utility  comparable  to
pre-mining conditions. Reclamation concerns include stabilization and vegetation
of  disturbed  lands,  controlling  drainage  from portals and waste rock dumps,
removal of roads and structures,  neutralization or removal of process solutions
and visual  aesthetics.  See Item 7,  &quot;Management's  Discussion  and Analysis of
Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Environmental Obligations.&quot;
</P>
<P>
Permits  governing  air and water  quality are issued to the Company by the
Montana Department of Health and Environmental  Sciences.  These permits must be
reviewed  and renewed at periodic  intervals.  Operating  permits  issued to the
Company by the Montana  Department  of State Lands and the United  States Forest
Service do not have an expiration date but are subject to periodic reviews.  The
reviews evaluate bonding levels and monitor reclamation progress.
</P>
<P>
The Company believes,  but cannot assure, that it has successfully complied
with all permitting  requirements for the planned expansion of its production at
the Stillwater Mine to 2,000 tons per day (&quot;TPD&quot;).
</P>
<P>
As part of the  Company's  redemption  in 1994 of the common  stock held by
Chevron,  the Company  agreed to indemnify  each of Chevron and Manville for all
claims  related to  environmental  damage or hazards caused by or arising out of
any acts or omissions of any entity other than Chevron or Manville,  or any acts
or omissions of Chevron or Manville while acting on behalf of or for the benefit
of the Company,  subsequent to September 30, 1993. The Company is indemnified by
Chevron and Manville each for claims relating to environmental damage or hazards
that existed as of September  30, 1993 and which arose out of  activities of the
predecessor  partnerships based on certain  representations and warranties given
to the Company by each of Chevron and Manville,  although these  representations
and warranties expired on September 30, 1996. No claims were made by the Company
against these warranties as of September 30, 1996. As such, the Company is fully
responsible for all environmental liabilities.

<P>
POSSIBLE REFORM OF THE GENERAL MINING LAW. During the 1995 legislative  session,
the United  States  Congress  considered a number of proposed  amendments to the
General Mining Law, which governs the location and  maintenance of mining claims
and related  activities on Federal lands.  Among those amendments were proposals
which would have imposed a royalty on production  from certain mining claims and
increased the cost of holding such claims. None of these amendments were enacted
into law. It is likely that Congress will consider similar  proposed  amendments
in the future.  The potential impact on the Company as a result of congressional
action is difficult to predict, but could adversely affect the Company's ability
to  economically  develop  the J-M Reef,  virtually  all of which is on  Federal

EXPANSION PLAN
</SPAN>
</P>
<P>
The Company  believes its current  operations  are sub-scale in relation to
its major South  African  competitors  and in relation to the  magnitude  of its
current reserve base, which contributes  materially to the Company's  relatively
high operating costs. In addition,  vast portions of the J-M Reef have yet to be
exposed to drilling and  development  sufficient to allow for the delineation of
additional  proven and  probable  reserves.  The  relatively  small scale of the
Company's  operations  impedes  the  realization  of the full  potential  of its
mineral assets.  Consequently,  the Company has adopted a long-term  strategy of
expanding its operations to the extent that economics and permitting allow.
</P>
<P>
The Company has completed the first three years of its four-year  Expansion
Plan, which is intended to significantly  increase  production at the Stillwater
Mine and related processing facilities.  The Expansion Plan included the sinking
of a 1,950 foot vertical shaft,  underground  development on new levels accessed
by the shaft,  increasing  the  capacity  of the  concentrator,  adding a second
converter to the smelter,  constructing a base metals  refinery and  replacement
and  standardization  of the mine equipment  fleet.  Construction  work for this
expansion  began in May 1994 and the Company  has  substantially  completed  all
minesite   surface   facilities,   concentrator   and   smelter   modifications,
construction of a base metals refinery and the vertical shaft.
</P>
<P>
The principal step in the Expansion Plan yet to be completed is underground
development  on  new  levels  accessed  by  the  vertical   shaft.   Underground
development  on new  levels  began  in the  third  quarter  of  1996,  with  the
assistance of a contractor,  and production from these new levels is expected to
begin in early 1997.
</P>
<P>
The Company anticipates the Expansion Plan will be completed and production
capacity will have reached 2,000 TPD in the second half of 1997, a doubling from
1994  levels.   These  anticipated  results  assume,  among  other  things,  the
identification  of sufficient proven reserves in close proximity to the vertical
shaft and the hiring and retention of sufficient numbers of individuals  skilled
in underground mining. No assurance can be given that the Expansion Plan will be
completed  on a timely basis or that the  expanded  operations  will achieve the
anticipated  production  levels.  See Item 7,  &quot;Factors  That May Affect  Future
Results and Financial Condition.&quot;
</P>
<P>
In 1996, the Company began work on the initial access phase of the proposed
East Boulder mine, including site preparation,  construction of a power line and
procurement  of a tunnel boring  machine.  In October this activity was deferred
primarily due to a downturn in platinum and palladium prices. Re-commencing work
on the initial access phase is contingent  upon numerous  factors,  including an
improvement  in metals prices and successful  completion of the Expansion  Plan.
Upon  completion  of the  initial  access  phase,  the  Company  would  need  to
demonstrate  economic feasibility and arrange financing in order to proceed with
the East Boulder project.

MINE PLAN
</SPAN>
</P>
<P>
Underground  development  has been increased in the Stillwater  Mine on the
existing  levels and in 1996  development was initiated from new levels accessed
by a 1,950 foot vertical shaft which was sunk adjacent to the concentrator.  The
shaft provides access to down dip extensions of reef areas mined during the past
eight  years.  Levels  accessed by the  production  shaft are being driven using
rubber-tired jumbo drills and LHD vehicles.
</P>
<P>
As new levels are established from the shaft, raises are being developed to
allow transfer of ore and waste to selected  levels for transport by rail to the
shaft.  In 1997, the Company plans to have all ore and waste on the west side of
the Stillwater Valley  transferred  through raises to the shaft. Over the longer
term, ore and waste produced in the Company's operations on the east side of the
Stillwater  Valley will be transferred  underground to the shaft when a crossing
on the 4,400 foot level is completed.  During 1997,  ore and waste from the east
side of the mine will be hauled to the surface  through  the  current  system of
ramps and horizontal adits.
</P>
<P>
Additional  surface   facilities  have  been  completed   including  a  new
maintenance  shop and  warehouse  and  extension of the current site offices and
change house. Site services  including access,  employee parking,  and electric,
water  and  sewer   facilities   were  expanded  and  upgraded  and  appropriate
pre-investments in infrastructure have been made to accommodate future plans.

<SPAN STYLE="font-weight: bold">
CONCENTRATOR, SANDFILL AND TAILINGS
</SPAN>
</P>
<P>
The Company's existing concentrator was expanded by the addition of a large
ball mill grinding unit,  additional flotation capacity and ancillary equipment.
Sandfill for stoping areas will continue to be provided from coarse concentrator
tailings pumped underground using existing pumps and pipelines.  As the distance
to mining areas increases,  booster sandfill pumping stations are proposed to be
installed.
</P>
<P>
Tailings  will  continue to be  deposited in the current  impoundment  area
immediately  adjacent  to the  concentrator  through  the year  2003  under  the
Expansion Plan. Waste rock from the mine is currently being used to increase the
height of the impoundment embankment for tailings storage.
</P>
<P>
The Company has  submitted  an  application  to the Montana  Department  of
Environmental  Quality (&quot;DEQ&quot;)  requesting an amendment to its Operating Permit.
The Company's proposal  contemplates the construction of a large, lined tailings
impoundment on the Hertzler Ranch seven miles north of the existing impoundment.
A pipeline  will connect the current and  proposed  tailings  impoundments.  The
Hertzler Ranch site has a thirty year design life at a production level of 2,000
tons per day. In  addition,  the  Company  has asked the DEQ to analyze  impacts
associated with further  expanding mine  production.  While the Company believes
that  its  proposal  represents  a sound  environmental  solution  to  long-term
tailings  disposal,  there is no assurance  that the  necessary  permits will be
granted.

CAPITAL EXPENDITURES AND OPERATING COSTS
</SPAN>
</P>
<P>
The Company's total projected capital  expenditures for the Expansion Plan,
during  the years  1994  through  1997 were  revised  in 1996 and are  currently
estimated at approximately  $90 million,  of which $35.9 million was expended in
1996. These estimated  expenditures are higher than original  estimates due to a
change in the method of accounting  for certain mine  development  costs adopted
January 1, 1996, to the capitalization of interest on the Company's  Convertible
Notes  and to minor  scope  changes  and cost  overruns.  However,  the  current
estimate is less than last year's estimate of $101 million due to a reduction in
1997's  planned  underground  development  program.  See  Item 7,  &quot;Management's
Discussion    and   Analysis   of   Financial    Condition    and   Results   of
Operations-Liquidity  and Capital Resources&quot; and &quot;Factors That May Affect Future
Results and Financial Condition&quot; at pages 29-37.
</P>
<P>
The Company's  cash operating  costs per  returnable  ounce of platinum and
palladium  are  expected to be reduced  significantly  after  completion  of the
Expansion Plan. These cost savings are expected to be substantially derived from
economies of scale, improved mine infrastructure and operating  efficiencies and
changes in mining method from  cut-and-fill  to more mechanized  methods.  These
cost efficiencies began to appear in 1996 results,  with a 15% reduction in mine
maintenance cost per ounce and a 28% reduction in  refining/transportation  cost
per ounce,  as a result of the BMR being  operational by mid-1996.  No assurance
can be given that the  expected  operating  cost  reductions  will be  achieved.
During  the  second  half of 1996,  the  Company  made $7.8  million  in capital
investments  toward  developing  the East  Boulder  mine.  This  investment  was
primarily towards purchasing a tunnel boring machine and providing an electrical
power  supply to the mine  portal  site.  See Item 7,  &quot;Factors  That May Affect

Company's  revenues.  Although  the  Company  is  unaware  of any such  alloy or
material, there can be no assurance that none will be developed.
</P>
<P>
The  Company  competes  with  other  suppliers  of PGMs,  some of which are
significantly  larger  than the  Company  and have  access  to  greater  mineral
reserves and financial and commercial resources.  See &quot;Supply&quot; below. Additional
mines may open over the next several years, such as the Hartley Platinum project
on the Great Dyke in Zimbabwe resulting in increased production. Furthermore, in
certain industrialized  countries, an industry has developed for the recovery of
PGMs from scrap sources,  mostly from spent automotive and industrial catalysts.

DEMAND
</SPAN>
</P>
<P>
Platinum's  unique  physical  qualities  include:  (i) a high melting point
(3,215 degrees Fahrenheit);  (ii) superior  conductivity and ductility;  (iii) a
high level of  resistance to corrosion;  (iv) strength and  durability;  and (v)
strong catalytic  properties.  Approximately  one-half of current world platinum
production  is  used  for   industrial   and   manufacturing   processes,   most
significantly  for the  manufacture of catalytic  converters for the global auto
industry.  Autocatalyst  demand is dependent upon growth in new vehicle sales in
countries where legislation  requires specific exhaust emission  standards;  new
vehicle  sales are, in turn,  dependent  to a  significant  degree upon  general
economic conditions. The first autocatalysts were fitted to American cars in the
early 1970's following approval of the initial United States government-mandated
emission  standards.  Legislation  requiring  autocatalyst  usage has since been
enacted in many other markets, including Japan and Europe. In addition, emission
standards  in the United  States have  continued  to become more  stringent  and
comprehensive, requiring autocatalysts with higher PGM loadings.
</P>
<P>
In addition to catalytic  converters,  industrial uses of platinum  include
the production of data storage disks, glass,  paints,  nitric acid,  anti-cancer
drugs, fiber optic cables,  fertilizers,  unleaded and high octane gasolines and
fuel cells.  The balance of current  platinum  demand is for the  production  of

jewelry, such as gem settings for rings, and for investment/collector  coins. In
1996, Japan accounted for a substantial majority of platinum jewelry demand.
</P>
<P>
Palladium,  like platinum,  has numerous  industrial  applications and when
combined with silver,  provides an extremely conductive material.  Today, nearly
half of the  palladium  supply  is  consumed  in the  production  of  electronic
components for personal computers,  cellular telephones,  facsimile machines and
other devices.  The second largest and fastest growing application for palladium
is in the automotive  industry with the  commercialization  of a  palladium-only
catalytic  converter.  Demand for  palladium-based  catalysts has been so strong
that it has  retarded  the growth of platinum  consumption  in major  automobile
markets.  Dentistry  has  long  been  a  major  use  for  palladium  due  to the
substitution of palladium alloys for gold-based dental alloys.
</P>
<P>
<SPAN STYLE="font-weight: bold">
SUPPLY
</SPAN>
</P>
<P>
The primary  production sources of platinum and palladium are mines located
in the Republic of South Africa, which provided approximately  two-thirds of the
platinum and  one-fourth of the palladium  worldwide in 1996.  The principal PGM
mining  companies  in the  Republic  of South  Africa  are  Rustenburg  Platinum
Holdings, Ltd., Impala Platinum Holdings, Ltd.
and Western Platinum, Ltd.
</P>
<P>
The second  largest  source of  platinum  and  palladium  is Russia,  which
provided  approximately  two-thirds  of  the  palladium  and  one-fourth  of the
platinum  worldwide  in 1996.  Approximately  half of this supply is believed to
have come from  stockpiles.  Russian  PGM output is a  by-product  of nickel and
copper production from the Noril'sk complex in Northern Siberia.
</P>
<P>
Small amounts of platinum and palladium are produced in Canada  principally
as a by-product of nickel and copper mining.
</P>
<P>
It is possible to recover  PGMs from old  automotive  catalytic  converters
acquired  from  scrap  yards.  A  small  but  growing  industry  has  developed,
predominantly  in North  America,  in the  collection  and recovery of PGMs from
scrap  sources,  including  automotive  catalytic  converters and electronic and
communications  equipment,  which could  provide  additional  feedstock  for the
Company's metallurgical complex in Columbus, Montana. Recovered PGMs are sold to
industrial customers, in some cases the same parties who provided the scrap.

The Company's  principal mineral  properties are described in Item 1 above.
In  addition  to the  Company's  controlled  mining  claims  and the  plant  and
equipment  located  within the mine,  the  Company  owns and  maintains a 55,000
square foot building containing the concentrator plant,  changing facilities and
offices and a recently  constructed 29,200 square foot shop and warehouse,  both
located within its 1,340 acre operating  permit area at the Stillwater  Mine. In
Columbus,  Montana,  the Company owns and maintains a 23,200 square foot smelter
plant and a 17,000  square-foot base metals refinery on property leased from the
Town of Columbus.  None of these properties is currently subject to any mortgage
or other  encumbrance.  The  Company  also  leases a 10,100  square  foot office
building in Columbus from a third party.  The Company believes that its existing
facilities  are  adequate  to service  current  production  levels.  See Item 1,
&quot;Business-Expansion Plan.&quot;
</DIV>
<P>
The  Company  also  owns  six  parcels  of land  totaling  2,473  acres  in
Stillwater  County,  Montana.  Certain  of these  parcels  are  leased  to ranch
operators,  and one has been  subdivided  for the  lease or sale of  residential
lots.  About 60 acres of one property is within the Company's  operating  permit
boundaries. Some of these properties also include residential rental units. Each
of these properties is subject to a mortgage in favor of Chevron and Manville to
support the Company's indemnification  obligations to such parties. See Item 13,

PRODUCTION
</SPAN>
</P>
<P>
The  Company's  production  of  platinum  and  palladium  is  substantially
determined  by the  tonnage of ore mined and its head grade  (ounces  per ton of
ore).  Processing facilities have historically been able to handle all ore mined
in a timely manner with consistent recoveries.
</P>
<P>
Approximately  40  days  elapse  between  the  production  of  ore  at  the
Stillwater Mine and the release of the platinum and palladium  contained therein
by a  contract  refiner.  Because  of this  processing  cycle,  changes  in mine
production  may not result in  corresponding  changes  in sales in a  particular

<DIV CLASS="eolCenter">

<A NAME="eolPage27"></A>
<P>
accounting period.  The Company  calculates  production as the payable ounces in
concentrate shipped by the Company's  concentrator to its smelter, which usually
occurs within seven days of the ore being mined.
</P>
<P>
The Stillwater Mine is permitted to operate at 2,000 tons-per-day (TPD). In
1993 the mine  operated at 1,000 TPD for the first time.  Tonnage has  increased
steadily since then and in 1996,  446,000 tons of ore were processed through the
concentrator,  equivalent  to 1,219 TPD.  Increases  in ore tonnage are achieved
through  increasing the number and quality of developed stopes,  adding manpower
and improving stoping  productivities,  principally  through the introduction of
mechanized mining methods.
</P>
<P>
The grade of the ore mined by the Company in a given period  depends on the
particular areas of the J-M Reef from which the ore is extracted in that period.
The grade of ore mined  varies  considerably  from  stope to stope and the grade
realized during a particular period depends on the mix of production during that
period.  When the Expansion  Plan is completed,  the Company  intends to develop
more  stopes than are needed for current  mining  operations  in order to better
manage  the mix of stopes  it mines and the  resulting  grade  delivered  to the
concentrator (head grade).
</P>
<P>
The average head grade of ore processed  through the  concentrator  in 1996
was  0.67  ounces  per  ton,  which  was the  same as the  head  grade  in 1995.
Historically,   the  mill  head  grade  at  the  Stillwater  Mine  has  averaged
approximately  0.77 ounces per ton.  The  average  head grade for 1995 was lower
than the historical average because of the decision to process subgrade material
through the  concentrator  in the absence of  sufficient  quantities  of ore. In
1996, the introduction of additional mechanized stoping methods resulted in more
mine  dilution and a reduction in mining grade from  historical  averages.  Also
contributing  to lower head grades in 1996 were  material  handling  and hauling
constraints  which  developed in 1996 when a larger  percentage of ore had to be
extracted  and hauled from the west side of the mine after east side stopes were
unable to be developed as planned.  Stringent controls such as measuring the ore
face width both  before and after each  blast,  separating  underground  ore and
waste  storage  areas,   introducing  colored  markers  into  underground  waste
stockpiles,  and monitoring ore and waste haulage  resulted in improved grade in
the fourth  quarter of 1996. New  infrastructure  currently  under  development,
particularly infrastructure associated with the production shaft, is expected to
alleviate many of these material handling constraints in 1997.

<SPAN STYLE="font-weight: bold">
REVENUE
</SPAN>
</P>
<P>
The Company's  revenue depends entirely on the number of ounces of platinum
and palladium sold and the price per ounce realized.  Prior to the completion of
the  BMR,   ounces  of  metal  sold  were  generally  tied  to  mine  production
approximately  three months earlier.  The  commissioning  of the BMR reduced the
delay to approximately 40 days and accelerated the availability of nearly 40,000
additional  ounces for sale,  principally  in the third  quarter  of 1996,  from
in-process  inventories.  The Company's  revenue and earnings are  significantly

<P>
influenced  by  worldwide  prices of platinum  and  palladium,  which  fluctuate
continuously and over which the Company has no control. Sales to three customers
represented approximately 98%, 92% and 96% of total revenues for the years ended
December 31, 1996, 1995 and 1994, respectively.  The Company sells its metals to
a  small  number  of  customers  and  brokers;   however,  the  Company  is  not
economically  dependent upon these customers since platinum and palladium can be
readily sold in numerous markets throughout the world.
</P>
<P>
The Company currently uses a simple hedging program involving spot deferred
forward sales commitments. The use of forward sales may result in a reduction in
potential  revenue if the  contract  price is less than the market  price at the
time of sale, although the Company has the option to defer delivery against spot
deferred contracts and sell at the market price. The Company has also, from time
to time,  bought put  options  and sold call  options  in order to  improve  the
Company's  opportunities  to benefit from upward price movements  within certain
parameters while still protecting against downside price risk.
</P>
<P>
As of December 31, 1996,  the Company had entered into sales  contracts for
deliveries of future production through May 30, 1997 of 5,920 ounces of platinum
and 31,930  ounces of  palladium  at prices  averaging  $388.55  and $121.28 per
ounce,  respectively.  The London A.M. Fix prices for platinum and  palladium at
December 31, 1996 were $370.25 and $116.50 per ounce,  respectively.  During the
first quarter of 1997, the Company was able to purchase additional spot deferred
forward  sale  contracts  such that as of  February  28,  1997,  the Company had
entered into sales  contracts on 1997  production of 186,500 ounces of palladium
at $135 per ounce and 37,900  ounces of platinum at $382 per ounce.  See Item 1,
&quot;Business-Current Operations-Sales and Hedging Activities.&quot;

<SPAN STYLE="font-weight: bold">
COST STRUCTURE
</SPAN>
</P>
<P>
Management  believes the Company's  current and historical  operating costs
are higher than those of comparable  primary  platinum and palladium  producers.
Average annual cash costs per ounce since 1990 have ranged from a low of $165 in
1993 to a high of $215 in 1995.  The Company  attributes  its higher  costs to a
number of factors  including  (i) mining  wages and  benefits in the Republic of
South Africa that are about  one-eighth  of the United  States  level;  (ii) the
relatively small scale of its operations; (iii) inefficient overall mine design;
<BR>
(iv)  prior to 1996,  its  reliance  on mining by the  labor-intensive  overhand
cut-and-fill stoping; (v) prior to 1996, older mine haulage equipment;  and (vi)
prior to the BMR commissioning,  no refining capability. The Company's Expansion
Plan is  designed  to mitigate  most of these  factors  and lower the  Company's
operating  costs  to a more  competitive  level.  The  Expansion  Plan  began to
mitigate  some of the Company's  production  costs in 1996 as reflected by a 15%
reduction  in  mine   maintenance   cost  per  ounce  and  a  28%  reduction  in
refining/transportation costs per ounce as a result of the BMR being operational
by mid-1996.  The remainder of the cost  efficiencies  will be achieved  through
economies  of scale at 2,000 TPD  production  rates and  underground  production

efficiencies  from full utilization of the vertical shaft system and large scale
stope  production  near the shaft.  The first full year of these  Expansion Plan
efficiencies will be in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Since 1990, exploration expenses have declined because most of the ore body
near the surface has already been defined.

PGM PRODUCTION. Platinum and palladium production increased to 59,000 ounces and
196,000 ounces,  respectively,  for the year ended December 31, 1996 from 51,000
ounces and  169,000  ounces,  respectively,  in 1995.  PGM  production  for 1996
resulted from milling 446,000 tons with an average head grade of 0.67 ounces per
ton. In comparison,  PGM production for 1995 resulted from milling  398,000 tons
with an average head grade of 0.67 ounces per ton.
</P>
<P>
Average head grade in 1996,  although lower than the historical average for
the Stillwater  Mine, was the same as for 1995.  Average head grade for 1995 was
lower than the  historical  average  due to milling  large  volumes of low grade
development  material  throughout  the year  and  from  the  lack of  sufficient
quantities  of high grade ore in the second and third  quarters.  The head grade
for 1996 was lower than the average historical head grade due to mining dilution
resulting  from  additional   mechanized   mining  and  from  material  handling
constraints  which led to the introduction of some waste into ore stockpiles.  A
new mining width control  system reduced mining  dilution  significantly  in the
fourth quarter and a new waste tracking system  significantly  reduced ore/waste
mixing,  resulting in a 0.74 head grade in the fourth quarter of 1996.

<P>
REVENUE.  Revenues  were $56.2  million  for the year ended  December  31,  1996
compared to $51.3 million in 1995, an increase of 10%.

Platinum  sales  volumes  increased  from  54,000  ounces in 1995 to 62,000
ounces in 1996. Palladium sales volumes increased from 180,000 ounces in 1995 to
214,000 ounces in 1996. Combined sales volumes increased 18% from 234,000 ounces
in 1995 to 276,000 ounces in 1996 primarily due to increased  production in 1996
and the  commissioning  of the BMR,  which  reduced  the time  period  from mine
production  to refinery  return of metals by nearly two months and thereby  made
nearly two months' additional production available for sale during the year.
</P>
<P>
Average realized prices per ounce for both platinum and palladium decreased
in 1996 reflecting a decrease in the market prices for both metals.  The average
spot price of  platinum  decreased  from $424 in 1995 to $397 in 1996;  realized
prices  decreased  from $425 in 1995 to $410 in 1996.  The average spot price of
palladium decreased from $151 in 1995 to $128 in 1996; realized prices decreased
from $157 in 1995 to $144 in 1996.  Because spot prices for both metals  trended

down  during the year,  the  Company's  hedging  contracts  resulted in realized
prices that were higher than spot prices.  Average  realized prices for platinum
exceeded  average spot prices for platinum by 3% while average  realized  prices
for palladium exceeded average spot prices by 12%.

<P>
OPERATING INCOME. The Company incurred an operating loss of $5.2 million for the
year ended December 31, 1996,  compared to an operating loss of $2.3 million for
1995.  The higher loss resulted  from lower prices and was  partially  offset by
lower cost per  ounce.  The  decrease  in costs per ounce for the  current  year
resulted  primarily from a 16% increase in ounces  produced.  The lower cost per
ounce was also the result of the positive  effect from the change in  accounting
for  capitalized  underground  development  expense  which more than  offset the
impact of increased depreciation and amortization and the $772,000 write-down of
assets.
</P>
<P>
NET  INCOME.  The  Company  realized  net  income  of $11.1  million  after  the
cumulative  effect of the  accounting  change for 1996 compared to net income of
$68,000 for 1995.  The net loss before the  cumulative  effect of the accounting
change for 1996 was $2.8  million.  The greater  net loss before the  cumulative
effect of the accounting  change for the current period was almost  entirely the
result of the previously discussed greater operating loss for 1996, as well as a
reduction of $1.7 million in net interest earned in 1996 compared to 1995.

comparison,  PGM production  for 1994 resulted from milling  373,000 tons with a
head grade of 0.80 ounces per ton.
</P>
<P>
Head grade in 1995 was considerably  lower than the historical  average for
the Stillwater  Mine. This resulted  primarily from milling large volumes of low
grade  development  material  throughout  the year and from a lack of sufficient
quantities  of high grade ore in the second and third  quarters.  As  additional
high grade stopes were brought into  production in the third and fourth quarters
and tighter operating  controls were  implemented,  head grade recovered to 0.74

Average realized prices per ounce for both platinum and palladium increased
in 1995 reflecting an increase in the market prices of both metals.  The average
spot price of  platinum  increased  to $424 in 1995 from $406 in 1994;  realized
prices  increased  to $425  from  $399.  The  average  spot  price of  palladium
increased to $151 in 1995 from $144 in 1994;  realized prices  increased to $157
from $138.  Because spot prices for platinum and palladium were trending down in
the last half of 1995, the Company's use of forward sales contracts  resulted in
realized prices that were higher than spot prices.

OPERATING INCOME. The Company incurred an operating loss of $2.3 million for the
year ended December 31, 1995,  compared to operating  income of $2.9 million for
1994.  This was the result of lower sales  volume and higher  costs per ounce of
metals sold in 1995,  partially  offset by higher  realized  prices per ounce in
1995. The higher costs per ounce of metal sold are primarily attributable to the
lower head grade  experienced in 1995.  Costs per ton milled  decreased by 6% to
$139 in 1995 from $148 in 1994. The 6% decrease in costs per ton milled was more
than offset by the 16%  decrease in head grade and  resulted in higher costs per
ounce in 1995.
</P>
<P>
NET INCOME.  The Company  realized net income of $68,000 for 1995  compared with
$2.0  million for 1994.  The  decrease of $1.9 million is due to the decrease in
operating  income  partially  offset by interest  income received in 1995 on the
remaining  net proceeds from the Company's  initial  public  offering and by the
absence of the 1994 extraordinary loss in 1995. In addition, net income for 1994
includes a favorable non-recurring tax adjustment of $810,000.

Net cash  provided by operations  for the year ended  December 31, 1996 was
$14.5  million,  an increase of $8.5  million from 1995.  This  increase was due
primarily to an increase in current  liabilities of $4.2 million,  a decrease in
inventories of $4.9 million because of the reduction of the period of time metal
is held in inventory  resulting  from the  completion  of the BMR and  partially
offset by the net loss realized for 1996.  Net cash  provided by operations  for
the year ended  December 31, 1995 was $6.0  million,  a decrease of $3.2 million
from 1994. The decrease in 1995 was due primarily to a $2.5 million reduction in

The Company  currently  has no  significant  environmental  projects  under

operating  expenditures for environmental  compliance within the next 12 months.
In  1996,  the  Company's  environmental  expenses  were  $536,000  and  capital
expenditures  for  environmental  equipment were $461,000.  The Company incurred
$541,000 in  environmental-related  costs  during  1995,  of which  $495,000 was
expensed and $46,000 was for purchases of environmental equipment. The Company's
ongoing operating  expenditures for environmental  compliance are expected to be
approximately    $500,000    per   year.    See   Item   1,    &quot;Business-Current

The Company is  presently  required to post surety  bonds with the State of
Montana in the amount of $4.2 million,  which also represents the Company's best
estimate of mine  closure and  reclamation  costs for  current  operations.  The
Company  does not  believe  that  costs will  materially  exceed  this  estimate
subsequent to  implementation of the Expansion Plan. The Company is accruing for
reclamation  costs  over  the  life of the  Stillwater  Mine  based  on  current
production  levels and estimated proven and probable  reserves.  On December 31,
1996 and 1995,  the accrued  liability was $556,000 and $490,000,  respectively.

scope of the Expansion  Plan,  the level of production  after  completion of the
Expansion  Plan  and the  anticipated  reduction  in  operating  costs  from the

&quot;Management's  Discussion  and  Analysis of Financial  Condition  and Results of
Operations.&quot;  While  sometimes  presented  with  numerical   specificity,   such
forward-looking  statements are based upon a variety of assumptions  relating to
the  business of the  Company,  which,  although  considered  reasonable  by the
Company, may not be realized,  and are subject to significant  uncertainties and

METAL PRICE VOLATILITY
</SPAN>
</P>
<P>
Since  the  Company's  sole  source  of  revenue  is the sale of PGMs,  the
profitability  of the  Company's  operations  can be  significantly  affected by
changes in the market prices of PGMs. For 1991, 1992, 1995, and 1996, the market
prices of PGMs were  below  the  Company's  total  costs of  production  and the
Company  experienced  operating  losses.  PGM  prices  fluctuate  widely and are
influenced by numerous  factors  beyond the Company's  control,  including  such
factors as  expectations  for inflation,  global demand,  consumption  patterns,
speculative  activities,  international economic trends,  political and economic
conditions  and  production  amounts  and  costs  in  the  other  PGM  producing
countries,  including the Republic of South Africa and Russia. Since some of the
world supply of platinum and  palladium is a by-product  of the mining of nickel
and copper,  a portion of the worldwide  production of platinum and palladium is
unrelated to the demand for such metals; as a result,  ordinary market balancing
mechanisms  may be less  effective.  In  order  to  mitigate  some of the  risks
associated with  fluctuating PGM prices,  the Company has utilized various price
hedging  techniques  to lock in  forward  delivery  prices on a  portion  of its
production.  However,  there  are no  assurances  that the use of price  hedging
techniques will always benefit the Company.  There is the  possibility  that the
Company will lock in forward deliveries at prices lower than the market price at
the time of delivery.  The market  prices of PGMs could fall below the Company's
production costs and remain at such levels for a sustained  period,  causing the
Company to experience  operating losses and to curtail or suspend some or all of
its mining  activities.  See Item 7,  &quot;Management's  Discussion  and Analysis of

RESERVE ESTIMATES
</SPAN>
</P>
<P>
While the  Company's  December 31, 1996 ore reserves  increased  over 1995,
such increase has not been affirmed and verified by independent consultants. The
ore reserve  estimates  presented in this report for December 31, 1996 are based
on the Company's best estimates and are necessarily imprecise and depend to some
extent on  statistical  inferences  drawn from limited  drilling,  which may, on
occasion, prove unreliable.  Reserve estimates are expressions of judgment based
on knowledge,  experience and industry  practice.  Although the Company believes
its estimated ore reserves are well established,  there can be no assurance that
its estimated ore reserves are accurate,  and future production experience could
differ   materially   from  such   estimates.   Should  the  Company   encounter
mineralization  or  formations  at any of its mines or projects  different  from
those  predicted  by  drilling,  sampling  and  similar  examinations,   reserve
estimates  may have to be adjusted  and mining plans may have to be altered in a
way that might adversely affect the Company's operations. Declines in the market
prices  of PGMs  may  render  the  mining  of some or all of the  Company's  ore
reserves uneconomic. No assurance can be given that any particular level of PGMs
may  be  recovered  from  the  ore  reserves  and  the  grade  of ore  may  vary
significantly  from time to time.  Moreover,  short-term factors relating to the
ore reserves, such as the need for additional development of the ore body or the
processing of new or different grades,  may impair the profitability of the mine
in any particular accounting period.

EXPANSION PLAN RISK
</SPAN>
</P>
<P>
Although  the  Company   anticipates   that  the  Expansion  Plan  will  be
successfully  completed  and that  the  resulting  operations  will  reach  full
production  by late 1997,  no assurance  can be given that the  remainder of the
Expansion Plan will be completed on a timely basis, that the expanded operations
will achieve the anticipated  production capacity or that the expected operating
cost reductions will be achieved.  The anticipated timing and production results
of the Expansion  Plan assume,  among other things,  (i) the  identification  of
sufficient proven reserves in close proximity to the vertical shaft and (ii) the
recruitment  and  maintenance of sufficient  numbers of  individuals  skilled in
underground mining. See Item 1, &quot;Business, PGM Ore Reserves.&quot;
</P>
<P>
The  construction  of  expanded  mining  operations  involves  a number  of
uncertainties,  including  factors  beyond  the  Company's  control.  Failure to
complete the Expansion  Plan on a timely basis or unexpected  cost  increases or
sales price decreases could have a material  adverse effect on future results of
operations  and financial  condition.  If the capital  expenditures  required to
complete the Expansion Plan or to achieve the  anticipated  production  capacity
are significantly higher than expected, there is no assurance that the Company's
capital  resources  would be  sufficient to cover such costs or that the Company

<P>
<SPAN STYLE="font-weight: bold">
COMPETITION
</SPAN>
</P>
<P>
The  Company  competes  with  other  suppliers  of PGMs,  some of which are
significantly  larger  than the  Company  and have  access  to  greater  mineral
reserves  and  financial  and  commercial  resources.  These  suppliers  include
Rustenburg  Platinum Holdings,  Ltd., Impala Platinum  Holdings,  Ltd. and other
South African  producers who mine the Bushveld  Complex in the Republic of South
Africa, which is the world's principal source of PGMs. PGMs are also produced as
a by-product  of large nickel and copper  operations  in Russia and Canada.  The
vast majority of the world's 1995 supply of PGMs came from the Republic of South
Africa or Russia.  Additional  mines may open in the Republic of South Africa or
elsewhere over the next several years, including the Hartley Platinum and Mimosa
projects  on  the  Great  Dyke  in  Zimbabwe,   resulting  in  increased  global
production.  Furthermore,  in certain industrialized  countries, an industry has
developed  for the  recovery  of PGMs from  scrap  sources,  mostly  from  spent
automotive and industrial catalysts.  There can be no assurance that the Company
will be successful in competing  with these existing and emerging PGM producers.
Moreover,  there can be no assurance that a less expensive  alternative alloy or
synthetic  material  which  has the  same  characteristics  as PGMs  will not be
developed  to  replace  PGMs in a  number  of key  technological  or  industrial
applications.
</P>
<P>
<SPAN STYLE="font-weight: bold">
EXPLORATION AND DEVELOPMENT RISKS
</SPAN>
</P>
<P>
The degree of profitability of the Company's operations will be affected by
the costs and results of its continued exploration and development programs. The
Company  is  seeking  to  expand  its  reserves  only  through  exploration  and
development  within its  controlled  claims which are located in the  Stillwater
Complex. Mineral exploration, particularly for platinum and palladium, is highly
speculative in nature,  involves many risks,  and  frequently is  nonproductive.
There can be no assurance that the Company's mineral exploration efforts will be
successful.  Once  mineralization  is  discovered,  it usually takes a number of
years from the initial  phases of  exploration  until  production  is  possible,
during which time the economic feasibility of production may change. Substantial
expenditures  are  required to  establish  ore  reserves  through  drilling,  to
determine  metallurgical processes to extract the metal from the ore and, in the
case of new  properties,  to construct  mining and processing  facilities.  As a
result of these  uncertainties,  no  assurance  can be given that the  Company's
exploration  programs will result in the replacement of existing reserves,  some
of which are being depleted by current production.

<P>
Depending upon the success of the Expansion Plan, the Company will evaluate
further expansion of the Stillwater Mine by possibly extending mining operations
to depths below those currently contemplated. The Company began the East Boulder

expansion  project during the second quarter of 1996.  During the fourth quarter
of 1996,  primarily as a result of the lower platinum and palladium prices,  the
Company  decided to defer  further  work on the  project.  The Company made $7.8
million in capital  investments toward the East Boulder expansion project during
1996. During 1997,  environmental baseline studies,  construction  activities on
the power line to the  minesite,  and  completion  of  progress  payments on the
tunnel  boring  machine are  expected to require  approximately  $2.0 million of
additional capital expenditures.  Additional development projects,  such as East
Boulder,  have no operating  history upon which to base estimates of future cash
operating costs.  Particularly for development  projects,  estimates of reserves
and cash operating costs are, to a large extent,  based upon the  interpretation
of geologic data obtained from drill holes and other  sampling  techniques,  and
feasibility  studies which derive  estimates of cash operating  costs based upon
anticipated  tonnage  and  grades  of  ore  to  be  mined  and  processed,   the
configuration of the ore body, expected recovery rates of the PGMs from the ore,
comparable  facility  and  equipment  operating  costs,   anticipated   climatic
conditions  and other  factors.  As a result,  it is  possible  that actual cash
operating  costs and economic  returns on such  development  projects may differ
significantly  from those currently  estimated.  It is not unusual in new mining
operations to experience unexpected problems during the start-up phase.
</P>
<P>
There  are a  number  of  uncertainties  inherent  in any  PGM  development
program,  including  the location of an economic reef  package,  development  of
appropriate  metallurgical processes,  receipt of necessary governmental permits
and  the  construction  of  mining  and  processing  facilities.   In  addition,
substantial  expenditures may be required to pursue such development activities.
The Company has been accelerating its development  efforts with the objective of
establishing  a  developed  reserve  equivalent  to a  minimum  of 18  months of
production  at 2,000 tons per day  production  rates.  Currently,  reserves  are
developed and available to support production at the 2,000 tons per day rate for
approximately 15 months.

MINING RISKS AND INSURANCE

Underground mining and the Company's milling and smelter operations involve
a number of risks  and  hazards,  including  environmental  hazards,  industrial
accidents,  unusual and  unexpected  rock  formations,  cave-ins,  flooding  and
periodic interruptions due to inclement or hazardous weather conditions or other
acts of God. Such risks could result in damage to, or  destruction  of,  mineral
properties or production  facilities,  personal  injury or death,  environmental
damage, delays in mining, monetary losses and possible legal liability. The Mine
Safety and Health  Administration  completes  periodic safety inspections of the
Company.  Six fatalities  have occurred at the Company's  mine since  operations
began in 1986,  the latest  occurring in August 1995.  There can be no assurance

that this  insurance  will cover the risks  associated  with  mining or that the
Company will be able to maintain  insurance to cover these risks at economically
feasible  premiums.  The Company  might also  become  subject to  liability  for
pollution or other hazards which it cannot insure  against or which it may elect
not to insure against because of premium costs or other reasons.

ENVIRONMENTAL RISKS

The  Company's  business is subject to extensive  Federal,  state and local
controls and regulations related to the environment, including the regulation of
discharge of materials into the environment, disturbance of lands, threatened or
endangered species and other environmental matters.  Generally,  compliance with
these  regulations  requires  the Company to obtain  permits  issued by Federal,
state and local regulatory agencies. Certain permits require periodic renewal or
review of their  conditions.  The Company cannot predict whether it will be able
to renew such permits or whether material  changes in permit  conditions will be
imposed.  Nonrenewal of permits or the imposition of additional conditions could
have a material adverse effect on the Company's  financial  condition or results

complied in all material respects with all Federal, state and local requirements
for the current operations and planned expansion of its mining activities at the
Stillwater  Mine.  Compliance  with these and other laws and  regulations  could
require  significant  capital outlays.  New laws and regulations,  amendments to
existing laws and  regulations,  or more stringent  enforcement of existing laws

TITLE TO PROPERTIES
</SPAN>
</P>
<P>
The validity of unpatented mining claims on public lands,  which constitute
most of the property  holdings of the  Company,  is often  uncertain  and may be
contested and subject to title defects.  While the Company has obtained  various
reports,  opinions  and  certificates  of title  with  respect to certain of the
claims it owns or to which it has the rights in accordance with what the Company
believes is industry  practice,  there can be no assurance that the title to any
of  its  claims  may  not  be  defective.   See  &quot;Business-Mining   Claims&quot;  and
&quot;Business-Current Operations-Regulatory and Environmental Matters.&quot;

WORKERS' COMPENSATION
</SPAN>
</P>
<P>
The Company has been allowed by the  Employment  Relations  Division of the
Montana  Department of Labor and Industry to self-insure its  obligations  under
the Montana Workers' Compensation Act through July 31, 1997, by posting a letter
of credit in the amount of $1.5 million.  The Employment  Relations Division has
the  authority to grant,  deny or revoke  applications  to be  self-insured  for
workers'  compensation  obligations,  and  there  can be no  assurance  that the
company  will be allowed  to  maintain  its  self-insured  status  indefinitely.
Failure  to  maintain  its   self-insured   status  for  workers'   compensation
obligations would have a material adverse impact on the Company and could render
the Company's operations uneconomic.

REPORT OF MANAGEMENT

</P>
<P>
Management  is  responsible  for the  preparation  of the  accompanying
financial  statements and for other  financial and operating  information in the
annual  report.  Management  believes that its  accounting  systems and internal
accounting  controls,  together with other controls,  provide assurance that all
accounts and records are maintained by qualified  personnel in requisite detail,
and accurately and fairly reflect  transactions of Stillwater  Mining Company in
accordance with established policies and procedures.
</P>
<P>
The Board of Directors  has an Audit  Committee,  none of whose members
are officers or employees of the Company or its affiliates.  The Audit Committee
recommends independent  accountants to act as auditors for the Company;  reviews
the Company's  financial  statements;  confers with the independent  accountants
with respect to the scope and results of their audit of the Company's  financial
statements and their reports thereon; reviews the Company's accounting policies,
tax matters and internal controls;  and oversees  compliance by the Company with
the requirements of Federal regulatory  agencies.  Access to the Audit Committee

accountants.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS

</P>
<P>
To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of
Stillwater Mining Company
</P>
<P>
In our opinion,  the  accompanying  consolidated  balance sheet and the
related consolidated  statements of operations,  of cash flows and of changes in
stockholders'  equity  present  fairly in all material  respects,  the financial
position of Stillwater  Mining  Company and its  subsidiary at December 31, 1996
and 1995,  and the results of their  operations and their cash flows for each of
the three years in the period  ended  December  31,  1996,  in  conformity  with
generally accepted  accounting  principles.  These financial  statements are the
responsibility of the Company's management;  our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these  financial  statements  based on our audits.  We conducted  our
audits of these  statements  in  accordance  with  generally  accepted  auditing
standards which require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain  reasonable
assurance   about  whether  the  financial   statements  are  free  of  material
misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the  amounts  and  disclosures  in  the  financial  statements,   assessing  the
accounting  principles  used and significant  estimates made by management,  and
evaluating the overall  financial  statement  presentation.  We believe that our
audits provide a reasonable basis for the opinion expressed above.

<P>
As  discussed in Note 2, the Company  changed its method of  accounting
for mine development expenditures in 1996.

NOTE 1
<BR>
NATURE OF OPERATIONS
</SPAN>
</P>
<P>
Stillwater  Mining  Company (the  &quot;Company&quot;),  a Delaware  corporation,  is
engaged in the  exploration,  development,  mining and  production  of platinum,
palladium and  associated  minerals from  properties  located in Stillwater  and
Sweet Grass Counties, Montana.
</P>
<P>
Prior to  October 1, 1993,  the  Company  consisted  of  Stillwater  Mining
Company  (SMC) and  Stillwater  PGM  Resources  (SPGMR) which were both Colorado
general  partnerships  equally  owned by  Chevron  U.S.A.  Inc.  (&quot;Chevron&quot;),  a
subsidiary of Chevron Corporation,  and Manville Mining Company (&quot;Manville&quot;),  a
subsidiary of Manville  Corporation.  The partners  shared equally in all of the
Company's  profits,  losses and  funding.  In 1993,  the  partners  approved the
reorganization of SMC and SPGMR into a single  corporation  effective October 1,
1993.  The Company issued 6.75 million shares of common stock to SMC and 675,000
shares to SPGMR and all assets and liabilities of SMC and SPGMR were transferred
to the new corporation.  In addition,  Manville and Chevron contributed land and
other  property at  historical  cost of  $294,000 in return for the  issuance of
37,500  shares of common  stock  each to  Manville  and  Chevron.  SMC and SPGMR
subsequently  transferred all of their shares in the Company equally to Manville
and Chevron and were  dissolved.  The Company had previously  issued 7.5 million
shares of common stock to SMC upon incorporation in December 1992.
</P>
<P>
The  reorganization was accounted for as a reorganization of entities under
common  control,  using  historical  cost,  in a manner  similar to a pooling of
interests.  The Company restated all historical financial information to reflect
the reorganization. Earnings and losses prior to October 1, 1993 were treated as
constructive  distributions or capital returns to the partners and were included
in paid-in capital.
</P>
<P>
On September 16, 1994, the Company  redeemed  Chevron's entire 50% interest
for $44 million.  In December 1994,  Manville,  in connection with the Company's
initial  public  offering of common stock,  sold 2,112,500  shares  reducing its
ownership to  approximately  27%. In August 1995,  Manville  sold its  remaining
interest in the Company to a group of institutional investors.
</P>
<P>
The  Company's  operations  can be  significantly  impacted  by  risks  and
uncertainties  associated with the mining industry as well as those specifically
related  to its  operations.  The risks and  uncertainties  that can  impact the
Company include but are not limited to the following:  metals price  volatility,
dependence on a single mine,  expansion  plan  completion,  reserve  estimation,
exploration and development,  competition,  environmental  obligations,  limited
refining  sources,  governmental  regulations  and  ownership  of and  access to
mineral reserves.

<BR>
SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
</SPAN>
</P>
<P>
<SPAN STYLE="font-weight: bold">
PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION
</SPAN>
</P>
<P>
The accompanying  consolidated financial statements include the accounts of
Stillwater Mining Company and its wholly owned subsidiary (collectively referred
to as the  &quot;Company&quot;).  All  intercompany  transactions  and balances  have been
eliminated in  consolidation.  Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified
to conform with current year presentation.
</P>
<P>
<SPAN STYLE="font-weight: bold">
USE OF ESTIMATES
</SPAN>
</P>
<P>
The  preparation  of the  Company's  consolidated  financial  statements in
conformity with generally accepted accounting  principles requires management to
make  estimates  and  assumptions  that  affect the  amounts  reported  in these
consolidated  financial  statements and accompanying notes. The more significant
areas requiring the use of management's  estimates  relate to certain  inventory
quantities,   mineral  reserves,   reclamation  and  environmental  obligations,
valuation  allowance for deferred tax assets,  useful lives for depreciation and
amortization, and future cash flows from long-lived assets.
Actual results could differ from these estimates.
</P>
<P>
<SPAN STYLE="font-weight: bold">
CASH EQUIVALENTS
</SPAN>
</P>
<P>
The Company  considers  all highly  liquid  investments  purchased  with an
original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents.
</P>
<P>
<SPAN STYLE="font-weight: bold">
SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS
</SPAN>
</P>
<P>
Short-term  investments consist primarily of corporate bonds and commercial
paper with maturities of less than two years from the date of settlement.  Under
Statement of  Financial  Accounting  Standards  (SFAS) No. 115,  ACCOUNTING  FOR
CERTAIN INVESTMENTS IN DEBT AND EQUITY SECURITIES,  these securities are carried
at amortized cost, which approximates fair value, as the Company has the ability
and intent to hold to maturity.
</P>
<P>
<SPAN STYLE="font-weight: bold">
REVENUE RECOGNITION
</SPAN>
</P>
<P>
Revenue is recognized  when the product is delivered and title transfers to
the buyer.  Revenues  consist of the sales  revenue for platinum and  palladium,
including  any hedging gain or loss.  By-product  metals  revenue and  secondary
materials processing revenue are included as an offset to cost of metals sold.

<P>
<SPAN STYLE="font-weight: bold">
HEDGING PROGRAM
</SPAN>
</P>
<P>
The Company  enters into  forward  sale  contracts  and put and call option
contracts  from time to time to reduce the effect of price  changes in  platinum
and  palladium on the Company's  sales.  The results of these  transactions  are
included in sales revenue at the time the hedged production is sold.
</P>
<P>
<SPAN STYLE="font-weight: bold">
INVENTORIES
</SPAN>
</P>
<P>
Metals  inventories  are  valued  at  the  lower  of  average  cost  or net
realizable  value.  Production  costs  include  the cost of  direct  labor,  raw
materials,  depreciation and amortization,  as well as administrative  expenses.
Materials  and supplies  inventories  are valued at the lower of average cost or
replacement value.
</P>
<P>
<SPAN STYLE="font-weight: bold">
PROPERTY, PLANT, AND EQUIPMENT
</SPAN>
</P>
<P>
Property,  plant and equipment are stated at cost and depreciated using the
straight-line  method over estimated useful lives ranging from five to 20 years,
or for capital leases,  the term of the related leases.  Maintenance and repairs
are charged to expense as incurred.  Mine development  expenditures  incurred to
increase  existing  production,  develop  new ore  bodies,  or develop  property
substantially  in advance of production are  capitalized and amortized using the
units-of-production  method.  Interest is capitalized on expenditures related to
construction or development  projects actively being prepared for their intended
uses and amortized  using the same basis of  depreciation  as the related asset.
Capitalization  is discontinued  when the asset enters  commercial  operation or
development ceases. Exploration costs are expensed as incurred.
</P>
<P>
Effective January 1, 1996, the Company changed its method of accounting for
mine development  expenditures whereby certain direct and indirect costs related
to development  activities,  which were previously expensed as incurred, are now
capitalized.  This  change is  believed to better  present  current  income from
mining  activities  because it results in a better matching of expenses with the
revenue  generated as a result of those  expenses.  The effect of the accounting
change on 1996 was to increase net income by  approximately  $5.2 million ($0.25
per share).  Assuming the accounting change had been applied retroactively,  the
unaudited  pro forma  effect  would have been an  increase in net income of $3.0
million ($0.15 per share) in 1995.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, the Company adopted SFAS No. 121, ACCOUNTING FOR THE IMPAIRMENT OF
LONG-LIVED  ASSETS AND FOR  LONG-LIVED  ASSETS TO BE  DISPOSED  OF. SFAS No. 121
requires  that an  impairment  loss be  recognized  in the event  that facts and
circumstances  indicate the carrying  amount of an asset may not be recoverable,
and  estimated  undiscounted  future net cash  flows are less than the  carrying
amount of the asset. The effect of adopting SFAS No. 121 was not material.

Primary  earnings  per share are  determined  by dividing net income by the
weighted   average  number  of  common  shares  and  common  stock   equivalents
outstanding.  Fully  diluted  earnings per share are  determined by dividing net
income by the weighted average number of common shares, common stock equivalents
and other dilutive shares (non-common stock equivalents)  outstanding.  Earnings
per share has not been  presented  for 1994,  since the  Company  completed  its

compensation   cost  using  the  intrinsic  value  based  method  of  accounting
prescribed by APB Opinion No. 25, ACCOUNTING FOR STOCK ISSUED TO EMPLOYEES,  and

over the life of the mine  using the  units-of-production  method.  Expenditures
related to ongoing reclamation programs are expensed as incurred. As of December
31, 1996, the Company has posted $4.2 million in reclamation bonds for state and
federal  requirements,  which also  represents  the  Company's  best estimate of
future   reclamation  and  mine  closure  costs  under  existing   environmental
legislation and the current operations plan. The accrued  reclamation  liability

Shares issuable under the Stock Plan may be newly issued or shares  purchased on

Interpretations  in  accounting  for its  employee  stock  options  because,  as
discussed below,  the alternative fair value accounting  provided for under SFAS
Statement  No.  123,  &quot;Accounting  for  Stock-Based  Compensation,&quot;  (SFAS  123)
requires  use of option  valuation  models  that were not  developed  for use in
valuing employee stock options.  Under APB 25, because the exercise price of the
Company's employee stock options equals the market price of the underlying stock
on the date of grant, no compensation expense is recognized.

     Pro forma  information  regarding  net  income  and  earnings  per share is
required by SFAS 123, and has been  determined  as if the Company had  accounted
for its employee stock options under the fair value method of SFAS 123. The fair
value for these options was estimated at the date of grant using a Black-Scholes
option pricing model with the following weighted-average assumptions:

Option  valuation models require the input of highly  subjective  assumptions
including the expected stock price  volatility.  Because the Company's  employee
stock options have characteristics  significantly different from those of traded
options,  and because changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially
affect the fair value estimate,  in management's opinion, the existing models do
not  necessarily  provide a  reliable  single  measure  of the fair value of its
employee stock options.

In October  1995,  the Board of Directors  of the Company  adopted a Rights
Agreement under which Stillwater  stockholders of record as of November 15, 1995
received  a  dividend  in the  form of  Preferred  Stock  Purchase  Rights  (the
&quot;Rights&quot;).  The Rights  permit the holder to purchase  one  one-thousandth  of a
share (a unit) of Series A Preferred  Stock at an initial  exercise price of $80
per unit under certain circumstances. The purchase price, the number of units of
Preferred Stock and the type of securities  issuable upon exercise of the Rights
are subject to adjustment.  The Rights expire on October 26, 2005 unless earlier
redeemed or  exchanged.  Until a Right is exercised,  the holder  thereof has no
rights as a stockholder  of the Company,  including the right to vote or receive
dividends.  Subject to certain  conditions,  the Rights become  exercisable  ten
business days after a person or group acquires or commences a tender or exchange
offer  to  acquire  a  beneficial  ownership  of 15% or  more  of the  Company's
outstanding common stock.

REFINING AGREEMENTS

</P>
<P>
The Company has contracted with two separate  entities to refine its filter
cake  production.  These  contracts  contain  termination  clauses upon adequate
notice but may require a substantial  payment in the form of a cancellation fee.
The Company  currently has no plans to terminate these contracts within the next
twelve months.

ELECTRIC SERVICE AGREEMENT
</SPAN>
</P>
<P>
During  1996,   Montana  Power  Company  (&quot;MPC&quot;)   upgraded  the  Company's
transmission  line and  substation  facilities.  The cost of this upgrade to MPC
totaled  approximately  $2.9 million.  In a contract between MPC and the Company
dated June 1, 1996,  the Company agrees to reimburse MPC for these costs through
additional  electrical  revenues  produced from the Company's  increased load in
excess of 8,000 kilowatts.  At the completion of the five-year agreement,  or at
such earlier date if the Company terminates operations,  if the total additional
revenues,  as defined in the contract between MPC and the Company,  have not met
or exceeded MPC's  investment  cost, the Company will be required to pay MPC the
difference.

service; and
</P>
<P>
WHEREAS,  the parties desire to continue their  relationship  as seller
and buyer of electric energy under the terms of a new agreement;
</P>
<P>
NOW THEREFORE, the parties agree as follows:
</P>
<DIV CLASS="eolCenter">
1
</DIV>
<HR CLASS="eolPageBreak">
<DIV CLASS="eolNewPage"></DIV>
<A NAME="eolPage68"></A>
<DIV>
Section 1:   SERVICE TO BE PROVIDED
</DIV>
<P>
1.1 Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement,  the Company
will supply,  on a firm basis, and the Customer will take and pay for,  electric
power (demand and energy)  required for the  operation of Customer's  mining and
milling operation located near Nye, Montana (&quot;Electric Service&quot;).
</P>
<P>
1.2 The Company is not  obligated to provide,  and the Customer  agrees
not to take in excess of 15,000  kilowatts  of demand,  which then  becomes  the
effective  Contract  Demand.  Demand  measured in excess of the Contract  Demand
limitation, if served, will be billed and paid for at a rate equal to five times
the applicable demand rate.
</P>
<P>
1.3 Should  Customer desire to increase its Contract  Demand,  Customer
may request  such  increase in writing to the Company  specifying  the amount of
increase  requested,  the date Customer wishes the increase to become  effective
and its duration.  The Company  shall,  within 90 days of such written  request,
respond in writing to what extent  Company has the electric  power  available to
satisfy  the  requested  increase.  If such  request  is  authorized,  the newly
established demand shall become the Contract Demand specified in Subsection 1.2.
If Company is unable or does not agree to make such increase available, Customer
may acquire  such  electric  power from  another  provider,  and  Company  shall
negotiate  terms and  conditions  in good faith for  delivery of such power at a
reasonable price.
</P>
<P>
1.4 The Electric  Service  provided shall be three-phase,  sixty-hertz,
alternating  current at approximately  13.2 kilovolts,  four (4) wire,  grounded
center wye.

<DIV CLASS="eolCenter">
2
</DIV>
<HR CLASS="eolPageBreak">
<DIV CLASS="eolNewPage"></DIV>
<A NAME="eolPage69"></A>
<P>
1.5 The  point of  delivery  of the  electric  service  shall be at the
terminals of the Company's 13.2 kV disconnect switch in the substation.
</P>
<DIV>
Section 2:  INSTALLATION AND REMOVAL OF FACILITIES
</DIV>
<P>
2.1 The location of power lines and substations  shall be designated by
mutual  agreement of the  Customer  and the  Company,  with every effort made to
locate them outside the area of present or probable mining  operations and where
they will not be interfered  with or affected by the mining or other  activities
of the  Customer.  In the event the Company is  required  to alter,  relocate or
remove such electric lines, equipment or substations,  the Customer will pay 100
percent of the  removal  costs and new  installation  costs  incurred,  less the
salvage value of the electric plant removed, unless such alterations, relocation
or removal is made  necessary by the  negligence  of the Company,  its officers,
agents or employees,  in which case Company shall bear such costs.  However,  if
the Company,  for its own  purposes,  chooses to alter,  relocate or remove such
electric lines,  equipment or  substations,  the Company will pay 100 percent of
the costs incurred.
</P>
<DIV>
Section 3:  METERING FACILITIES
</DIV>
<P>
3.1 The  Electric  Service  shall be metered  for  billing  purposes by
equipment  recording  the  kilowatt-hours  consumed  and  the  maximum  combined
fifteen-minute  interval kilowatt demand at the delivery  voltage.  The metering
equipment will be installed at the point of delivery and owned and maintained by
the Company.
</P>
<DIV CLASS="eolCenter">

</DIV>
<HR CLASS="eolPageBreak">
<DIV CLASS="eolNewPage"></DIV>
<A NAME="eolPage70"></A>
<P>
3.2 METERING AND  MEASUREMENT.  Company will meter the electrical power
(demand and energy) delivered to Customer at the point of delivery. In addition,
the parties agree to the following testing and corrective procedures:
</P>
<P>
3.2.1 CUSTOMER'S METER - Customer may install,  operate
and  maintain,  at its  sole  expense,  equipment  for the  purpose  of
measuring the amount of electric energy  delivered over any measurement
period  (Customer  meter),  provided the equipment  shall not interfere
with such delivery or with the Company's metering  equipment.  Under no
circumstances  shall  Customer  be  allowed  access  to  the  Company's
secondary metering circuits.
</P>
<P>
3.2.2  ALTERNATIVE  MEANS OF MEASUREMENT - In the event
the  Company's  metering  equipment  is out  of  service  or  registers
inaccurately, measurement shall be determined in the following sequence
by:
</P>
<P>
a.  Using  back-up  metering  installed  by
Company, if installed; or
</P>
<P>
b.  Using  the  reading  of the  Customer's
meter,  if installed and  accurately  registering,  in which
case,  Customer will promptly provide data from its meter as
requested  by  Company.   Customer's   meter  shall  not  be
considered  accurate unless it has been tested in accordance
with the testing  intervals  and  procedures  in  Subsection
3.2.3; or
</P>
<P>
c. To the  extent  the  methods  described
above   cannot  be  utilized,   performing  a   mathematical
calculation   or   estimating  by  reference  to  Customer's
operating records for the period in question.
</P>
<DIV CLASS="eolCenter">

</DIV>
<HR CLASS="eolPageBreak">
<DIV CLASS="eolNewPage"></DIV>
<A NAME="eolPage71"></A>
<P>
3.2.3  TESTING - At no  greater  than  sixty (60) month
intervals, the Company's meters shall be replaced with meters that have
been recently  tested and  calibrated in the  Customer's  presence,  if
Customer so  desires.  These  meters  shall have an accuracy at time of
test of plus or minus 1/2 of 1 percent  (0.5%) at both 10 percent (10%)
and  100  percent  (100%)  of the  rated  Test  Amperes  (T.A.)  of the
Watt-hour  Meter at 100  percent  (100%) of  nameplate  voltage,  rated
frequency, and ambient temperature of 23(Degree)C +/- 5(Degree)C.  When
the replacement  meter is installed,  the meter being replaced shall be
tested  under  the same  procedure  as the new  meter.  If the meter is
inaccurate  by  more  than  plus  or  minus  1/2 of 1  percent  (0.5%),
adjustments to prior meter readings and resulting bills will be made as
outlined in Subsection  3.2.5  CORRECTIONS OF METERING  ERRORS.  In the
event that either  party  notifies  the other that it desires a test of
the accuracy of its own or of the other party's metering equipment, the
parties shall cooperate to secure a prompt verification of the accuracy
of  such  equipment.  Notice  shall  be  addressed  to  the  electrical
engineering  contact at Customer's  mining and milling  operation or to
Company's Manager of Industrial Services in Butte, Montana and shall be
in writing at least fourteen days in advance of said testing.
</P>
<P>
3.2.4 COST OF TESTING - Company  shall bear the cost of
normally scheduled testing and any required adjustment of the Company's
meter. In the event that Customer requests a testing of Company's meter
at other than  normal  intervals,  Customer  shall bear the cost of the
testing, including meter removal and replacement, unless such equipment
is found to be  inaccurate  by  greater  than 1/2 of 1  percent  (0.5%)
(either high or low).
</P>
<DIV CLASS="eolCenter">

</DIV>
<HR CLASS="eolPageBreak">
<DIV CLASS="eolNewPage"></DIV>
<A NAME="eolPage72"></A>
<P>
3.2.5   CORRECTIONS  OF  METERING  ERRORS  -  If,  upon
testing,  the  Company's  meter  removed  from  service  is found to be
inaccurate  by less  than or equal to 1/2 of 1 percent  (0.5%)  (either
high or low), previous recordings of such equipment shall be considered
accurate in computing  deliveries of electrical energy  hereunder.  If,
upon  testing,  Company's  meter  shall be found  to be  inaccurate  by
greater than 1/2 of 1 percent (0.5%) (either high or low), any previous
recordings by such Company  meter shall be corrected to zero error,  to
the extent  possible,  and Company  shall  promptly  send to Customer a
report based on such corrected  recordings.  If no reliable information
exists as to when the  Company  meter  became  inaccurate,  it shall be
assumed for correction purposes hereunder that such inaccuracy began at
the point in time midway between the testing date and the last previous
date on which the Company  meter was tested and found to be accurate or
adjusted to be accurate,  with the adjustment  period not to exceed six
<BR>
(6) months.
<BR>
a.  The   provisions   of   Subsection   1.2
pertaining  to billing  Customer  five times the  applicable
demand rate for demand  exceeding  the Contract  Demand will
not apply in the event that  metering  inaccuracies  prevent
Customer from having knowledge of such potential exposure.
</P>
<P>
3.2.6  MAINTENANCE - Each party shall have the right to
be present  whenever the other party  changes or tests its meter.  Each
party shall give timely  notice to the other party in advance of taking
any  such  actions.   Notice  shall  be  addressed  to  the  electrical
engineering  contact at Customer's  mining and milling  operation or to
Company's Manager of Industrial Services in Butte,  Montana. Each party
shall  give at  least 24  hours  notice  to the  other  party  prior to
undertaking the above described activity.

<DIV CLASS="eolNewPage"></DIV>
<A NAME="eolPage73"></A>
<P>
3.3   BILLING ADJUSTMENTS -
</P>
<P>
a. If meter tests as described above indicate that meter
has been more than 1/2 of 1 percent (0.5%) high,  correct  billing will
be determined  according to  Subsection  3.2.2 and the Customer will be
credited for the difference.
</P>
<P>
b. If meter  tests as  described  above  indicate  that
meter has been more than 1/2 of 1 percent (0.5%) low,  correct  billing
will be determined  according to Subsection 3.2.2 and the Customer will
be billed for the difference.
</P>
<DIV>
Section 4:   PAYMENT
</DIV>
<P>
4.1 The  Customer  shall pay the  Company for the  Electric  Service in
accordance  with the terms of the  applicable  rate schedule for such service in
effect from time to time. The applicable rate in effect at the time of execution
of this  Agreement is GS-2 which is attached as Exhibit A and by this  reference
made a part  hereof.  The  Company  will  propose to  implement  other  forms of
electric rates in the near future (i.e.,  Real Time Pricing,  Time Of Use) which
will be included in tariffs and will be  available  for the Customer if approved
by the Commission.
</P>
<P>
4.2 All rate  adjustments  to the  applicable  rate  schedule,  whether
temporary,  interim or final  authorized by the Commission or its successor with
respect to the Electric Service  rendered under this Agreement,  shall be deemed
amendments to this Agreement.
</P>
<P>
4.3  Statements  for amounts due under this Section 4 shall be rendered
monthly  and shall be due and  payable  in  immediately  available  funds at the
general  offices of the Company in Butte,  Montana  fifteen  (15) days after the
receipt of invoice.
</P>
<DIV CLASS="eolCenter">

</DIV>
<HR CLASS="eolPageBreak">
<DIV CLASS="eolNewPage"></DIV>
<A NAME="eolPage74"></A>
<P>
4.4 If  payments  are not made in full  within  the  fifteen  (15) days
following  the receipt of such  statements,  the Company may,  upon fifteen (15)
days  written  notice  and  without   incurring  any  liabilities  to  Customer,
discontinue in full, or in part,  Electric Service hereunder until such payments
are made in full,  unless the Customer  informs the Company in writing of a bona
fide dispute with respect to an amount due and pays the  undisputed  portion.  A
discontinuance  of service  under this section shall not be deemed a termination
of this  Agreement.  Amounts due but not paid hereunder shall bear interest from
the due date at an annual rate equal to the Prime Rate established by the Morgan
Guaranty  Trust Company of New York in effect at the time these  amounts  become
due and payable.
</P>
<DIV>
Section 5:  REGULATORY JURISDICTION
</DIV>
<P>
5.1   All Electric  Service  provided  by the Company is subject to the
jurisdiction  of the Commission or its successor.
</P>
<DIV>
Section 6:  AGREEMENT TERM, MINIMUM BILL AND EXIT FEES
</DIV>
<P>
6.1 This Agreement shall be effective for Electric  Service provided by
Company to  Customer  from and after its  Effective  Date and shall  continue in
effect for a period of five (5) years  unless  extended  for a specific  term by
mutual  agreement of the parties before the termination  date. No &quot;exit fees&quot; or
&quot;stranded costs&quot; are provided for by this Agreement;  however, the parties agree
that such exclusion should not be construed either to prohibit or to support the
imposition  of such fees by law.  Customer  shall have no obligation to take its
energy requirements from Company and Company shall have no obligation to provide
Customer its energy  requirements after termination of this Agreement,  provided
</P>
<DIV CLASS="eolCenter">
8
</DIV>
<HR CLASS="eolPageBreak">
<DIV CLASS="eolNewPage"></DIV>
<A NAME="eolPage75"></A>
<P>
both parties have acceptable options which are allowed by law. If the Company is
required to provide  Electric  Service at the end of the initial term because of
lack of market  access by the  Customer,  the  Company  shall  provide  Electric
Service to Customer at prices to then be  determined  by tariff or contract,  as
may be appropriate.
</P>
<P>
6.2 Customer and Company  recognize that significant  changes may occur
in the  availability and cost of electric power  generation,  in wholesale power
purchase opportunities, and in retail electric service caused by changes in fuel
costs, electric power markets, and transmission  regulation.  With the potential
for such  changes and their  impact on the  Agreement  and if a signed  offer as
specified in Section 6.2.1 below is presented,  the parties agree to renegotiate
this  Agreement  after  March 1,  1999,  not more  often  than once  during  any
consecutive twelve-month period.
</P>
<P>
6.2.1 To commence renegotiations after March 1, 1999, Customer
must  present to Company a signed  offer by a third  party  offering to
sell power and energy to  Customer  at  Customer's  mining and  milling
operation  at a total  delivered  price  equal to or less  than  ninety
percent  (90%) of the rates  contained in the  then-current  applicable
rate schedule,  presently  Electric  Tariff  Schedule No. GS-2 that was
approved by the  Commission  for service on and after March 1, 1996. If
Customer can provide a reasonable  demonstration that the offered power
and energy can be  delivered  at the price  offered  above by the third
party to the Customer's  mining and milling  operation,  Customer shall
inform  Company  thereof  and give  Company  an  opportunity  to make a
comparable price offer.
</P>
<P>
6.2.2 If  Company  does not meet  the  offered  prices  and if
existing  law  and/or   regulation  then  authorizes  the  wheeling  of
electricity  for retail  customers,  Company shall  negotiate terms and
conditions  in good faith for the delivery of such offered power to the

<DIV CLASS="eolNewPage"></DIV>
<A NAME="eolPage76"></A>
<P>
Customer's mining and milling operation.  The Company shall execute the
necessary wheeling agreements to enable electric energy to be delivered
to the  Customer's  operation at wheeling  rates,  terms and conditions
approved  by  the  Federal  Energy   Regulatory   Commission  or  other
appropriate regulatory body and the Agreement shall then be terminated.
</P>
<P>
6.2.3 If Company does not meet the third  party's offer within
thirty (30) business days of notification  by Customer,  the Customer's
mining  and  milling  operation  shall have no  further  obligation  to
purchase  its  Electric  Service from  Company.  If Customer  elects to
contract for  Electric  Service  from a third  party,  thereafter,  the
Company  shall  have no  further  obligation  to supply  such  Electric
Service,  and this  Agreement  shall be terminated.  However,  Customer
shall be obligated to pay the following costs:
</P>
<P>
a. A  payment of the balance of the Company's  actual
investment,   as   defined  in  Subsection   9.1,  less  Total
Additional  Revenue,  as  defined in  Subsection  9.2, and any
associated  surcharges  (see  Commission-authorized  Rule  No.
6-10) on that difference; and

Section 9:  CUSTOMER REVENUE OBLIGATION
</DIV>
<P>
9.1  Company  will  upgrade  its   transmission   line  and  substation
facilities to serve  Customer's  Stillwater  Mining  Complex.  Company's  actual
investment attributed to Customer (estimated to be $2,920,000) must be recovered
through Total  Additional  Revenues  produced from Customer's  increased load in
excess  of 8,000 kW.  Company  shall  advise  Customer  of its Total  Additional
Revenue obligation within three (3) months of the project's completion.

<A NAME="eolPage79"></A>
<P>
9.2 Company  shall  calculate  Total  Additional  Revenues by using the
demand  greater  than 8,000 kW and the  associated  energy  (kWh),  based on the
monthly load factor, at the effective GS-2 rates to determine additional monthly
revenues {i.e., If a particular month's load was 12,000 kW with a load factor of
80 percent for 720 hours, the associated energy would be 2,304,000 kWh (4,000 kW
<BR>
x 720 hours x .80) and the  associated  demand  would be 4,000 kW  (12,000  kW -
8,000 kW)}. If fifty percent (50%) of the accumulated Total Additional  Revenues
have not met or exceeded  Company's actual  investment after five years from the
Effective Date, or upon termination of operations by Customer,  whichever occurs
first,  Customer  shall pay Company the difference  between (1) Company's  total
investment  and  (2)  Total  Additional  Revenues,  along  with  any  associated
surcharges  (as  specified  by  Commission-authorized  Rule  No.  6-10)  on  the
difference  between (1) and (2), in accordance with  Subsection 4.3.  Customer's
obligation to the Company for Company's investment shall be relieved at any time
during the first five (5) years of this  Agreement  that fifty  percent (50%) of
the cumulative Total Additional Revenues exceed Company's actual investment.

6.1            Each sample prepared in accordance with this Section 6.0 shall be
               divided into four portions for analysis:

                   i)       One for Stillwater

6.2            Stillwater and  Westaim shall each analyze its portion for nickel
               plus cobalt using standard  commercial methods and shall exchange
               its analysis with the other by cross-mailing on a mutually agreed
               date.  If  Stillwater  and  Westaim's  analyses  are  within  the
               splitting  limit,  the average shall be used for settlement.  The
               splitting for nickel plus cobalt shall be 0.3 g/L.

6.3            If Stillwater and Westaim's analyses are not within the splitting
               limit  and  differences  are not  settled  in a  manner  mutually
               acceptable to Stillwater  and Westaim,  the parties may from time
               to time appoint an umpire to analyze the umpire sample portion.

7.0            PRICE AND PAYMENT TERMS

7.1            Subject  to the  terms  of  this  Agreement,  Westaim  shall  pay
               Stillwater  for  Accountable  Nickel  delivered  in any  month an
               amount equal to the Reference Price for Nickel for the applicable
               Quotational  Period  less US $0.84 per pound,  if such  Reference
               Price for Nickel is US $3.36 or less and if the  Reference  Price
               for Nickel is greater  than US $3.36 per pound an amount equal to
               75% for the Reference Price for Nickel.

7,3            Payments to Stillwater  shall be made by telegraphic  transfer in
               US currency  by the end of the month  following  the  Quotational
               Period.

7.3            No payment will be made for copper in the Product until such time
               as the US embargo on  materials  of Cuban  origin is removed.  At
               that time Westaim will reopen  discussions  with  Stillwater  for
               payment of the contained copper, subject to the terms under which
               Westaim is able to sell its copper sulphide by product to another
               party. For indicative  purposes,  the Accountable Copper would be
               90% of contained and the payment for Accountable  Copper would be
               at the  average  LME  Settlement  price for copper for the second
               month following delivery less US $0.50 per pound.

8.0            TERM

8.1            This Agreement shall be for a term commencing on June 1, 1995 and
               terminating on December 31, 1998.


9.0            FORCE MAJAURE

9.1            The term &quot;force  majeure&quot;,  as employed in this Agreement,  shall
               mean  an  Act  of  God,  strike,  interference  of  trade  union,
               industrial  dispute,  lockout,  act  of  the  public  enemy,  war
               (whether   declared   or  not),   blockade,   revolution,   riot,
               insurrection,   civil   commotion,   lightning,   storm,   flood,
               explosion,   fire,   breakdown   of   machinery   or   equipment,
               governmental restraint,  restriction, or other action, embargoes,
               unavailability of highway or railway freight facilities,  and any
               other cause, whether of the kind specifically enumerated above or
               otherwise,  which is not  reasonably  within  the  control of the
               effected  patty  and  which  is of  such a  nature  as to  delay,
               curtail,  or prevent timely action by the affected party.

9.2            If either  party is rendered  unable,  wholly or in part by force
               majeure, to carry out its obligations under this Agreement,  that
               party shall give to the other party prompt  written notice of the
               force  majeure,   with  reasonable  full   particulars   thereof,
               whereupon  the  obligations  of the  party  declaring  the  force
               majeure  shall be  suspended  during,  but no  longer  than,  the
               continuance of the force majeure.  The declaring  party shall use
               all  reasonable  diligence to remedy the force majeure as quickly
               as practicable.

9.3            No right of a party shall be affected for failure or delay of the
               party declaring to meet the conditions of this  Agreement,  which
               failure  is  caused by one of the  events  of the  force  majeure
               herein referred to.

9.4            The requirement that any force majeure shall be remedied with all
               reasonable diligence shall not require the settlement of strikes,
               lockouts,  or other labour  difficulty  by the affected  party on
               terms not  acceptable to it. How all such  difficulties  shall be
               handled is entirely within the discretion of the affected party.

9.5            This clause shall provide relief only as long as the condition of
               Force  Majeure shall  continue,  except that it shall not relieve
               Westaim  from  its  obligation  to  pay  Stillwater  for  Product
               delivered prior to the commencement of the Force majeure.
