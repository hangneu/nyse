	This Annual Report contains forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements provide our current expectations or forecasts of future
	events. Forward-looking statements include statements about our expectations, beliefs, plans, objectives, intentions, assumptions and other statements that are not historical facts. Words or phrases such as &#147;anticipate,&#148;
	&#147;believe,&#148; &#147;continue,&#148; &#147;estimate,&#148; &#147;expect,&#148; &#147;intend,&#148; &#147;may,&#148; &#147;ongoing,&#148; &#147;plan,&#148; &#147;potential,&#148; &#147;predict,&#148; &#147;project,&#148; &#147;will&#148; or
	similar words or phrases, or the negatives of those words or phrases, may identify forward-looking statements, but the absence of these words does not necessarily mean that a statement is not forward-looking. Examples of forward-looking statements
	in this Annual Report include, but are not limited to, statements regarding our disclosure concerning our operations, cash flows, financial position, dividend policy and likelihood of success in acquiring additional vessels to expand our business.

	Forward-looking statements appear in a number of places in this Annual Report including, without limitation, in the sections

<I>
	Forward-looking statements are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties and are based on potentially inaccurate assumptions
	that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expected or implied by the forward-looking statements. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in forward-looking statements for many reasons, including the
	factors described in &#147;Risk Factors&#148; in this Annual Report. The risks described under &#147;Risk Factors&#148; are not exhaustive. Other sections of this Annual Report describe additional factors that could adversely affect our results of
	operations, financial condition, liquidity and the development of the industries in which we operate. New risks can emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for us to predict all such risks, nor can we assess the impact of all such risks on
	our business or the extent to which any risks, or combination of risks and other factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements. Accordingly, you should not unduly rely on these
	forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date of this Annual Report. We undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statement to reflect circumstances or events after the date of this Annual Report or to
	reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events. You should, however, review the factors and risks we describe in the reports we will file from time to time with the Securities and Exchange Commission, or &#147;SEC,&#148; after the date of this
	Annual Report.

	On September&nbsp;30, 2015, we received notice of re-delivery for Ville d&#146;Aquarius, our oldest vessel built in 1996; the vessel was re-delivered on October&nbsp;29, 2015. Given our assessment of the vessel&#146;s
	re-chartering prospects in the then market environment and an imminent class mandated tail shaft survey, a sale of the vessel was completed on November&nbsp;5, 2015 for net proceeds of approximately $4.6 million. The vessel was written down as at
	September&nbsp;30, 2015 by $22.2 million to its estimated net realizable value, after deduction of estimated selling costs.

	re-delivered on December&nbsp;3, 2015 and similar to her sister vessel, Ville d&#146;Aquarius, a sale of the vessel was completed on December&nbsp;8, 2015 for net proceeds of approximately $4.7 million. An impairment charge of $22.5 million was

	On November&nbsp;8, 2010, we signed agreements with the sellers of two 4,231 TEU
	container vessels which terminated our purchase obligations totaling $154.8 million.&nbsp;Under the agreements we (i)&nbsp;released deposits, including accrued interest and totaling approximately $8.1 million per vessel (ii)&nbsp;made a further cash
	payment of approximately $6.2 million per vessel and (iii)&nbsp;transferred to the sellers certain supplies purchased for the vessels which were valued at approximately $0.4 million per vessel.&nbsp;The total value of these items was $29.4 million,
	or $14.7 million per vessel.&nbsp;In exchange, we acquired purchase options giving us the right, but not the obligation, to purchase each vessel on the first anniversary of its delivery by the builder to the seller, for a final payment of $61.25
	million per vessel.&nbsp;The purchase options were to be exercised by September&nbsp;16, 2011 for one vessel and October&nbsp;4, 2011 for the other vessel. Under U.S. GAAP, (i)&nbsp;the estimated fair value of the two purchase options was recorded
	as an intangible asset in the balance sheet of $13.6 million and (ii)&nbsp;the balance of the consideration paid in the transaction amounting to $17.1 million was expensed as an impairment charge in 2010. The purchase of these vessels was always
	predicated on achieving a strong return for shareholders by acquiring the vessels, which had time charters attached, at an attractive price and securing financing on favorable terms.&nbsp;As we were not able to obtain committed finance on acceptable
	terms, the intangible asset of $13.6 million was written off in 2011 and the purchase options were allowed to expire.

	facility were $599.1 million. The facility&#146;s floating interest rate was hedged with interest rate derivatives which gave rise to realized losses and unrealized gains or losses. The Company completed the issue of $420.0 million 10.000% First
	Priority Senior Secured Notes (the &#147;notes&#148;) on March&nbsp;19, 2014, the principal use of proceeds being to repay the amounts outstanding under the Previous Credit Facility of $366.6 million which was then terminated, and to settle and

	All but three of our 18 vessels are chartered to CMA CGM. CMA CGM&#146;s payments to
	us under these charters are our principal source of operating revenue. We are consequently highly dependent on the performance by CMA CGM of its obligations under these charters. The container shipping industry has been suffering an extended
	cyclical downturn since mid-2008, and many container shipping companies reported substantial losses. Financial performance of container shipping companies improved in 2012, 2013 and 2014. However, market conditions deteriorated in 2015 with lower
	than expected growth in the demand for container shipping services and higher than expected growth in the containership fleet from the delivery of new buildings. Freight rates, charter rates and asset values remain under pressure due to oversupply
	of container ship capacity. Further, CMA CGM has announced the proposed acquisition of Singapore-based container shipping company Neptune Orient Lines Limited for a total consideration of $2.4 billion in a debt and cash funded transaction. The
	acquisition, which is subject to anti-trust approvals, may weaken the CMA CGM group&#146;s liquidity at least until CMA CGM integrates Neptune Orient Lines Limited. We have experienced, from time to time, delays in receiving charterhire payments
	from CMA CGM, which under the charter contracts are due to be paid on the 1

	If CMA CGM ceases doing business or fails
	to perform its obligations under our charters, our business, financial position and results of operations would be materially adversely affected as it is probable that, even if we were able to find replacement charters, such replacement charters
	would be at significantly lower daily rates and for shorter durations. If such events occur, there would be significant uncertainty about our ability to continue as a going concern.

	Thirteen of our 18 vessels are managed by CMA Ships, a wholly owned subsidiary of CMA CGM, which, for an annual management fee of $123,000 per
	vessel, is responsible for all day-to-day ship management, including crewing, purchasing stores, lubricating oils and spare parts, paying wages, pensions and insurance for the crew, and organizing other vessel operating necessities, including the
	arrangement and management of drydocking. Our ship management agreements with CMA Ships may be terminated by either party on two months written notice. In the future, CMA Ships may demand a higher fee or other more favorable terms in consideration
	for its services or decide to terminate its agreements with us. The prices or terms of new ship management agreements with CMA Ships or an alternate provider may be significantly less favorable to us than the terms of our existing ship management
	agreements. Our five other vessels are managed by a ship manager based in Hong Kong on similar terms, which subjects us to similar risks.

	As at December&nbsp;31, 2015, CMA CGM owned approximately 44.4% of our outstanding common stock. Accordingly, CMA

	could have an adverse effect on the price of our common stock. In addition, CMA CGM may acquire additional shares of our common stock or initiate changes to our board of directors. In May 2014, we appointed two additional independent directors to
	our board with those seats filled by CMA CGM nominees. Under our bylaws, in order for the approval of contracts or transactions involving a related party not to be voidable (1)&nbsp;any interested director&#146;s relationship or interest as to the
	contract or transaction must be disclosed to the board of directors, and such contract or transaction must be authorized by a majority of the disinterested directors (or, in certain cases, all of the disinterested directors) or (2)&nbsp;the contract
	or transaction must be specifically approved in good faith by vote of the shareholders. Furthermore, our corporate governance guidelines require a director with a personal interest in a matter being approved by the board of directors to disclose the

	interests over our interests. These conflicts may have unfavorable consequences for us. Although our ship management agreements expressly prohibit CMA Ships from giving preferential treatment when performing any of its ship management services to
	any other vessel that is affiliated with it, or otherwise controlled by CMA CGM, conflicts of interest may arise between us, and CMA Ships as ship manager and CMA CGM as charterer. These risks may be exacerbated in the event that CMA CGM elects to
	exert more influence in the management of our business through its nominated board representation, acquiring additional shares of our common stock or otherwise.

	agreed with CMA CGM, with effect from February&nbsp;1, 2014, to extend by three years the charters on four other vessels at a lower on-going daily charter rate. Our agreements with CMA CGM may include terms that could not have been obtained from

	One of our objectives is to grow by acquiring additional vessels and chartering them out to container shipping companies potentially including
	CMA CGM. Our growth will generally depend on continued growth and renewal in world and regional demand for containership chartering. The ocean-going shipping container industry is both cyclical and volatile in terms of charter hire rates and
	profitability. Short-term containership charter rates have fluctuated significantly during the last few years, and are expected to continue to fluctuate in the future. Fluctuations in containership charter rates result from changes in the supply and
	demand for vessel capacity which are driven by global fleet capacity and utilization and changes in the supply and demand for the major products internationally transported by containerships. The factors affecting the supply and demand for
	containerships, and the nature, timing and degree of changes in industry conditions are unpredictable.

	Acquisition of vessels will be
	challenging as, inter alia, we may need to obtain additional financing in order to complete vessel purchases. Due to the continuing effects of the economic downturn and the severe cyclical downturn in the container shipping industry, financing for
	investment in containerships, whether newbuildings or existing vessels, is severely limited. Further, the cost of any available financing has increased significantly. In addition, in recent years, the number of lenders for shipping companies has
	decreased and lenders have generally lowered their loan-to-value advance ratios, shortened loan terms and accelerated repayment schedules. The actual or perceived credit quality of our charterers and proposed charterers, and any defaults by them,
	may materially affect our ability to obtain the additional capital resources that we will require to purchase additional vessels or may significantly increase our costs of obtaining such capital. These factors may hinder our ability to access
	financing and we may be unable to obtain adequate funding for growth.

	As of February&nbsp;1, 2016, newbuilding containerships with an aggregate capacity of 3.9&nbsp;million TEUs, representing
	approximately 19.6% of the total worldwide containership fleet capacity as of that date, were under construction. The size of the orderbook will result in the increase in the size of the world containership fleet over the next few years. An
	over-supply of containership capacity, combined with stability or any decline in the demand for containerships, may result in a reduction of charter hire rates, which is currently the case. The time charters for five of our 18 containerships can be
	terminated as early as dates between September&nbsp;11, 2017 and October&nbsp;28, 2017. The charters of an additional two vessels could terminate in March and September 2018. While we generally expect to be able to obtain new time charters for our
	vessels prior to their expiry, we cannot be assured that this will occur in any particular case, or at all. In addition, the supply/demand balance for containerships has been under pressure since late 2008 with, from time to time, a significant
	number of vessels idle and charter rates in the spot market depressed and we may not be able to secure charter rates at the same level as the current time charters. If we are unable to obtain new time charters for our containerships at favorable
	rates or are unable to secure new charters promptly, or at all, the vessels would be idle. We would continue to incur certain operating costs but earn no revenue, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financings, results of

	holder may enforce its lien by arresting a vessel through foreclosure proceedings. The arrest or attachment of one or more of our vessels, for valid or invalid reasons, could interrupt the charterer&#146;s or our cash flow and require the charterer

	the claimant&#146;s maritime lien and any &#147;associated&#148; vessel, which is any vessel owned or controlled by the same owner. Claimants could try to assert &#147;sister ship&#148; liability against one vessel in our fleet for claims relating

	In addition, as vessels grow older, they generally decline in value. Due to the cyclical nature of the container market, if for any reason we
	sell any of our owned vessels at a time when prices are depressed, we could incur a loss and our business, results of operations, cash flow and financial condition could be adversely affected. Additionally, under our current time charter agreements
	with CMA CGM, the charterer has a right of first refusal should we decide to sell the vessel during or at the end of the charter period. If they do not exercise this right, we are entitled to sell the vessel, subject to their prior approval, which
	cannot be unreasonably withheld. We may be forced to sell our vessels for a lesser amount because of these constraints. Moreover, if the book value of a vessel is impaired due to unfavorable market conditions, we may incur a loss that could

	new equipment and may restrict the type of activities in which our vessels may engage. We cannot assure you that, as our vessels age, market conditions will justify any such expenditures or expenditures to otherwise improve their operating
	characteristics, such as fuel efficiency to enable us to operate our vessels profitably during the remainder of their useful lives, which could adversely affect our results of operations. Our fleet of 18 vessels as at December&nbsp;31, 2015 had an

	Acquiring and renewing charters with leading liner companies depends on a number of factors, including our ability to man our containerships
	with suitably experienced, high quality masters, officers and crews. The limited supply of and increased demand for well-qualified crew, due to the increase in the size of the global shipping fleet, has from time to time created upward pressure on
	crewing costs, which we generally bear under our time charters. Increases in crew costs and other vessel operating costs such as insurance, repairs and maintenance, and lubricants may adversely affect our profitability. In addition, if we cannot
	retain a sufficient number of high quality onboard seafaring personnel, our fleet utilization will decrease, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

	The cost of fuel is a significant factor in negotiating charter rates and can affect us both directly and indirectly. The cost of fuel will be

	arrangements in the future, and to the extent we do so, an increase in the price of fuel beyond our expectations may adversely affect our profitability. We also bear the cost of fuel associated with dry-dockings and when a vessel is off-hire. Even

	Container shipping is a cyclical industry, with the demand for container shipping services and therefore the demand for container ships, driven
	by global trade.&nbsp;The global financial crisis, from late 2008, contributed to a contraction of demand for the first time in the history of containerization, with 2009 volumes falling by 9%.&nbsp;In 2010, demand rebounded, with volume growth of
	almost 13%.&nbsp;During 2011, macroeconomic sentiment softened and containerized trade growth slowed to approximately 7.0%. In 2012, 2013, and 2014, volume grew by 3.0%, 5.1% and 5.4%, respectively. Volume growth in 2015 is estimated to have been
	2.3%. In contrast, containership capacity grew by 5.9%, 5.5%, and 6.4% in 2012, 2013 and 2014, respectively, and it is estimated to have grown 8.0% in 2015.

	Global financial markets and economic conditions have been severely disrupted and volatile at
	times in recent years and remain subject to significant vulnerabilities, such as the deterioration of fiscal balances and the rapid accumulation of public debt, continued deleveraging in the banking sector and limited supply of credit. Credit
	markets and the debt and equity capital markets have been exceedingly distressed and volatile. The sovereign debt crisis in countries such as Cyprus and Greece, for example, and concerns over debt levels of certain other European Union member states
	and other countries around the world, as well as concerns about some international banks, has increased volatility in global credit and equity markets. These issues, along with the re-pricing of credit risk and the difficulties currently experienced
	by financial institutions have made, and will likely continue to make, it difficult to obtain financing. As a result of the disruptions in the credit markets, many lenders have increased margins, enacted tighter lending standards, required more
	restrictive terms (including higher collateral ratios for advances, shorter maturities and smaller loan amounts), or refused to refinance existing debt at all or on terms similar to our current debt. Furthermore, certain banks that have historically
	been significant lenders to the shipping industry have announced an intention to reduce or cease lending activities in the shipping industry. New banking regulations, including larger capital requirements and the resulting policies adopted by
	lenders, could reduce lending activities. We may experience difficulties obtaining financing commitments in the future if current or future lenders are unwilling to extend financing to us or unable to meet their funding obligations due to their own

	China exports considerably more goods than it imports. Our containerships are deployed on routes involving containerized trade in and out of
	emerging markets, and our charterers&#146; container shipping and business revenue may be derived from the shipment of goods from the Asia Pacific region to various overseas export markets including the United States and Europe. Any reduction in or
	hindrance to the output of China based exporters could have a material adverse effect on the growth rate of China&#146;s exports and on our charterers&#146; business. For instance, the government of China has implemented economic policies aimed at
	increasing domestic consumption of Chinese made goods. This may have the effect of reducing the supply of goods available for export and may, in turn, result in a decrease of demand for container shipping. Additionally, though in China there is an
	increasing level of autonomy and a gradual shift in emphasis to a &#147;market economy&#148; and enterprise reform, many of the reforms, particularly some limited price reforms that result in the prices for certain commodities being principally
	determined by market forces, are unprecedented or experimental and may be subject to revision, change or abolition. Furthermore, if China was to permit the Renminbi to float to a free market rate of exchange, it is widely anticipated that the
	Renminbi would appreciate significantly in value against the U.S. dollar. An increase in the value of the Renminbi may negatively impact the U.S.&#146; demand for imported goods, many of which are shipped in containerized form. The level of imports
	to and exports from China could be adversely affected by changes to these economic reforms by the Chinese government, as well as by changes in political, economic and social conditions or other relevant policies of the Chinese government.

	Piracy is an inherent risk in the operation of ocean-going vessels and particularly affects vessels operating in

	in loss of life, the kidnapping of crew or the theft, damage or destruction of vessels or of containers or cargo being transported thereon. In addition, while we believe the charterer remains liable for charter payments when a vessel is seized by

	all apply to the same covered persons or proscribe the same activities, and such sanctions and embargo laws and regulations may be amended or strengthened over time. In 2010, the United States enacted the Comprehensive Iran Sanctions Accountability

	investment, supply or export of refined petroleum or petroleum products. In 2012, President Obama signed Executive Order 13608 which prohibited U.S. persons from engaging in transactions or dealings with foreign individuals or entities that
	(1)&nbsp;have violated, attempted to violate, conspired to violate or caused a violation of certain Executive Orders related to Iran or Syria, (2)&nbsp;facilitated any deceptive transactions for or on behalf of any person subject to U.S. sanctions

	&#147;ITRA&#148;), which expanded the range of Iran-related activities that expose third parties to sanctions, created new sanctions and strengthened existing sanctions. Among other things, the ITRA intensified existing sanctions regarding the
	provision of goods, services, infrastructure or technology to Iran&#146;s petroleum or petrochemical sector. The ITRA also included a provision requiring the President of the United States to impose five or more sanctions from Section&nbsp;6(a) of
	the Iran Sanctions Act, as amended, on a person the President determines is a controlling beneficial owner of, or otherwise owns, operates, or controls or insures a vessel that was used to transport crude oil from Iran to another country and

	known the vessel was so used. The ITRA also included a requirement that issuers of securities must disclose to the SEC in their annual and quarterly reports filed after February&nbsp;6, 2013 if the issuer or &#147;any affiliate&#148; has
	&#147;knowingly&#148; engaged in certain activities involving Iran during the timeframe covered by the report. In January 2013, the United States enacted the Iran Freedom and Counter-Proliferation Act of 2012 (the &#147;IFCPA&#148;) which expanded
	the scope of U.S. sanctions on any person that participated in Iran&#146;s energy, shipping or shipbuilding sector and operators of ports in Iran, and imposes penalties on any person who facilitates or otherwise knowingly provides significant

	from lists of sanctioned persons, including those designated under Executive Order 13608. Thus, the United States has committed not to impose sanctions on non-U.S. persons for engaging in certain transactions or dealings in Iran involving finance

	related to the Republic of Cyprus in terms of ownership or ship management. Cypriot vessels will be allowed passage through the Turkish Straits (Bosphorus) with or without pilot but no other services or provisions will be given, including bunker

	disagrees with and will not acquiesce to the rental versus services distinction in the
<I>
	Tidewater
</I>
	decision, and in its discussion stated that the time charters at issue in
<I>
	Tidewater
</I>
	would be treated as producing services income for PFIC
	purposes. The IRS&#146;s statement with respect to
<I>
	Tidewater
</I>
	cannot be relied upon or otherwise cited as precedent by taxpayers. Further, the facts in
<I>
	Tidewater
</I>
	are not directly analogous to our facts.&nbsp;No assurance can be given
	that the IRS or a court of law would accept our position, and there is a risk that the IRS or a court of law could determine that the company is a PFIC.

	If the IRS were to determine that we are or have been a PFIC for any taxable year, our U.S. shareholders will face adverse U.S. tax
	consequences. Distributions paid by us with respect to our shares will not constitute qualified dividend income if we were a PFIC in the year we pay a dividend or in the prior taxable year and, hence, will not be eligible for the preferential rate
	of tax that applies to qualified dividend income. In addition, our U.S. shareholders (other than shareholders who have made a &#147;qualified electing fund&#148; or &#147;mark-to-market&#148; election) will be subject to special rules relating to
	the taxation of &#147;excess distributions&#148;&#151;with excess distributions being defined to include certain distributions we may make on our Class&nbsp;A common shares as well as gain recognized by a U.S. holder on a disposition of our
	Class&nbsp;A common shares. In general, the amount of any &#147;excess distribution&#148; will be allocated ratably to each day of the U.S. holder&#146;s holding period for our Class&nbsp;A common shares. The amount allocated to the current year and
	any taxable year prior to the first taxable year for which we were a PFIC will be included in the U.S. holder&#146;s gross income for the current year as ordinary income. With respect to amounts allocated to prior years for which we were a PFIC, the
	tax imposed for the current year will be increased by the &#147;deferred tax amount,&#148; which is an amount calculated with respect to each prior year by multiplying the amount allocated to such year by the highest rate of tax in effect for such
	year, together with an interest charge as though the amounts of tax were overdue. See Item&nbsp;10.E. &#147;Additional Information&#151;Taxation &#151;Tax Consequences of Holding Class&nbsp;A Common Shares&#151;Consequences of possible passive

	Our legal and commercial name is Global Ship Lease, Inc. We are a Republic of the Marshall
	Islands corporation that owns a fleet of containerships of a range of sizes. Our business is to charter out our fleet under long-term, fixed-rate charters to reputable container shipping companies to generate stable revenues and predictable cash
	flows.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	We were formed in 2007 to purchase and charter back containerships then owned or to be purchased by CMA CGM, the third largest
	containership operator in the world by number of vessels. We acquired our initial fleet of 17 containerships from CMA CGM between December 2007 and August 2009. All of the vessels were time chartered back to CMA CGM for terms between five and 17
	years. Two of the initial charters, relating to our 4,113 TEU vessels, Ville d&#146;Aquarius and Ville d&#146;Orion, expired in September 2012 and were renewed successively with CMA CGM until late April 2014 for Ville d&#146;Aquarius and late May
	2014 for Ville d&#146;Orion. New charters were agreed with another charterer, Sea Consortium, trading as X-Press Feeders, commencing May&nbsp;7, 2014 for Ville d&#146;Aquarius and July&nbsp;17, 2014 for Ville d&#146;Orion. These charters were
	successively renewed until the vessels&#146; redelivery to us late in 2015. The vessels were sold on November&nbsp;5, 2015 and December&nbsp;8, 2015, respectively. On October&nbsp;28, 2014, we took delivery of the 8,063 TEU OOCL Tianjin, having
	purchased it from Orient Overseas Container Lines Limited (&#147;OOCL&#148;). The vessel was immediately chartered back to OOCL for a period between 36 and 39 months. On March&nbsp;11, 2015, we took delivery of a second 8,063 TEU vessel, the OOCL
	Qingdao, also purchased from OOCL and, again, immediately chartered back for a period between 36 and 39 months. On September&nbsp;17, 2015, we took delivery of a third 8,063 TEU vessel, the OOCL Ningbo, also purchased from OOCL and, again,
	immediately chartered back for a period between 36 and 39 months. The TEU weighted average remaining term of our 18 charters was 4.8 years at December&nbsp;31, 2015 and TEU weighted average age for the fleet was 11.0&nbsp;years. Our management team
	undertakes all management of our fleet including the supervision of the day-to-day technical ship management of our vessels which as of December&nbsp;31, 2015 was provided for 13 of our 18 vessels by CMA Ships, a wholly owned subsidiary of CMA CGM,
	pursuant to ship management agreements, with an agreement to cap the reimbursement by us of expenses incurred on our behalf on the vessels they charter. A third party ship manager based in Hong Kong provides the day-to-day technical management of
	the other five vessels.

	Until March&nbsp;19, 2014, long-term debt comprised amounts outstanding under
	the Previous Credit Facility that was first drawn in December 2007. A total of $599.1 million was drawn under this facility. The floating interest rate was hedged with interest rate derivatives which gave rise to realized losses and unrealized gains
	or losses. The Previous Credit Facility was repaid by a quarterly cashflow sweep from November 2009. On March&nbsp;19, 2014, we completed the issue of $420.0 million 10.000% notes, the principal use of proceeds being to repay the then $366.6 million

	A time charter is a contract for the use of a vessel for a fixed period of time at a specified daily rate. Under a time charter, the vessel
	owner provides crew, lubricating oil, all maintenance and other services related to the vessel&#146;s operation, the cost of which is included in the daily rate. The vessel owner is also responsible for insuring its interests in the vessel and
	liabilities as owner arising from its use. The charterer is responsible for substantially all of the vessel&#146;s voyage costs, such as fuel (bunker) costs, canal fees, port expenses, extra war risk insurance costs if the vessel is deployed outside
	normal insurance limits and for entering areas which are specified by the insurance underwriters as being subject to additional premiums and cargo handling charges.

	Each of the

	expirations of our charters will reduce our exposure to rechartering risk upon expiration of our initial charters and may mitigate the impact of the cyclical nature of the container shipping industry. The charters on our initial 17 vessels had terms
	of five to 17 years (plus or minus 90 days at charterer&#146;s option). We agreed with CMA CGM, with effect from February&nbsp;1, 2014, to extend by three years the charters on four vessels at a lower on-going daily charter rate. As at

	Daily charter
	rate refers to the gross amount per day payable by the charterer to the owner for the use of the vessel. It may be reduced by chartering commission payable to a broker or other party. Under our time charters, hire is payable to us typically every 15
	days in advance and in U.S. dollars. The daily charter rate is a fixed daily amount that will remain the same for the duration of the charter, although the charter rate can be reduced in certain circumstances where there are added costs to the
	charterer due to vessel performance deficiencies in speed or fuel consumption. Hire can also be reduced, pro-rata for any cost savings that we may realize, if the vessel is laid up or idled at the charterers&#146; request. Our initial charters with
	CMA CGM provide for an increase in charter rate when we incur unavoidable capital expenditure above a specified threshold to comply, for example, with regulatory requirements introduced after the charters were agreed.

	.&nbsp;Also referred to as extended annual surveys, intermediate surveys are typically conducted two and one-half years after (a)&nbsp;commissioning the vessel and (b)&nbsp;after each class
	renewal. A drydocking is usually required during the intermediate survey for inspection of underwater parts and for repairs related to inspections. However, by increasing the resilience of the underwater coating and marking the vessel&#146;s hull to
	accommodate in-water inspection by divers, in-water inspections may be accepted by classification societies in lieu of drydockings at intermediate surveys. If any defects are found, the classification surveyor will issue a &#147;recommendation&#148;
	that must be rectified by the ship-owner within prescribed time limits. A drydocking would only be required if the in-water inspection showed urgent repairs that could only be carried out in drydock. In-water inspections are typically less expensive
	than drydocking inspections and we intend to conduct in-water inspections when that option is available to us.

	Class Renewal Surveys
</I>
	.&nbsp;Class renewal surveys, also known as special surveys, are carried out typically every five years on the ship&#146;s hull, machinery, including the electrical plant, and any special
	equipment classed, at the intervals indicated by the character of classification for the hull. Vessels are normally required to be inspected in a drydock as part of the special survey. However, with the classification society&#146;s approval, the
	vessel can be subject to an underwater inspection, in lieu of a drydocking. At the special survey, the vessel is thoroughly examined including audio-gauging to determine the thickness of the steel structures. Should the thickness be found to be less
	than class requirements, the classification society would prescribe steel renewals. Substantial expense may have to be incurred for steel renewals to pass a special survey if the vessel has experienced excessive wear and tear. As an alternate to
	carrying out all of the required inspections at the special survey every five years, a ship-owner has the option of arranging with the classification society for the vessel&#146;s hull or machinery to be on a continuous basis, in which every
	relevant part of the vessel would be surveyed on a five year cycle. A dry-docking or underwater inspection is required at the fifth year anniversary to inspect underwater parts. The process of continuous class renewal spreads out the required
	inspections and their associated cost, while the vessel is still in service, and reduces the amount of inspection required each fifth year.

	The IMO&#146;s International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution
	from Ships, or MARPOL, imposes environmental standards on the shipping industry relating to oil spills, management of garbage, the handling and disposal of noxious liquids, harmful substances in packaged forms, sewage and air emissions. Annex I
	specifies requirements for continuous monitoring of oily water discharges and establishes a number of special areas in which more stringent discharge standards are applicable. Carriage of chemicals in bulk is covered by regulations MARPOL Annex II.
	Annex III of MARPOL regulates the transportation of packaged dangerous goods (marine pollutants) and includes standards on packing, marking, labeling, documentation, stowage, quantity limitations and pollution prevention. These Annex III
	requirements have been expanded by the International Maritime Dangerous Goods Code, which imposes additional standards for all aspects of the transportation of dangerous goods and marine pollutants by sea. Annex IV contains a set of regulations
	regarding the discharge of sewage into the sea, the configuration and operation of ships&#146; equipment and systems for the control of sewage discharge, and requirements for survey and certification. Annex V totally prohibits the disposal of
	plastics anywhere into the sea, and severely restricts discharges of other garbage from ships into coastal waters and special areas. MARPOL&#146;s Annex VI sets limits on sulphur oxide, nitrogen oxide, carbon dioxide and particulate matter emissions
	from ship exhausts and prohibits deliberate emissions of ozone depleting substances, such as chlorofluorocarbons. Annex VI also includes a global cap on the sulphur content of fuel oil and allows for the creation of Emission Control Areas, or ECAs.
	Already established ECAs include the Baltic Sea, the North Sea, including the English Channel, the North American area and the U.S. Caribbean Sea area. Additional geographical areas may be designated as ECAs in the future. Annex VI calls for
	incremental reductions in sulphur in fuel between 2012 and 2020 (or 2015 in the case of ECAs), with the global sulphur cap reduced initially to 3.50% (from 4.50%), effective from January&nbsp;1, 2012, then progressively to 0.50%, effective from
	January&nbsp;1, 2020, subject to a feasibility review to be completed no later than 2018. Annex VI also calls for the use of advanced technology engines designed to reduce emissions of nitrogen oxide, with a &#147;Tier II&#148; emission limit for
	engines installed on or after January&nbsp;1, 2011 and a more stringent &#147;Tier III&#148; emission limit for engines installed on or after 2016 operating in nitrogen oxide ECAs.

	The operation of our vessels is also affected by the requirements set forth in the International Management Code for the Safe Operation of
	Ships and Pollution Prevention, or ISM Code, compliance with which is required under the International Convention of Safety of Life at Sea, or SOLAS. The ISM Code requires ship-owners or any other entity such as a manager or a bareboat charterer,
	who has assumed the responsibility for operating and managing the vessel, to develop and maintain a &#147;Safety Management System,&#148; which includes the requirements to assess all identified risks; adopt a safety and environmental protection
	policy achieving the ISM Code objectives; adopt instructions and procedures to ensure safe operation of ships and protection of the environment pursuant to international and flag state laws and regulations; define levels of authority and lines of
	communication between, and among, shore and shipboard personnel; implement procedures for reporting accidents and non-conformities with the provisions of the ISM Code and corrective action; implement procedures to prepare guidelines and respond to
	emergency situations; and implement procedures for regular internal audits and management reviews including evaluating effectiveness. The ISM Code requires that the vessel operator be issued a Document of Compliance and the vessels it operates be
	issued a Safety Management Certificate, evidencing compliance by the vessel&#146;s management with ISM Code requirements for a Safety Management System. The failure of a ship-owner or bareboat charterer to comply with the ISM Code may subject such
	party to increased liability, may decrease available insurance coverage for the affected vessels and may result in a denial of access to, or detention in, certain ports. As at December&nbsp;31, 2015, each of the vessels in our fleet, and the
	entities managing them, were certified pursuant to requirements of ISM Code. There can be no assurance that any certification will be maintained indefinitely. SOLAS itself specifies minimum standards for the construction, equipment and operation of
	ships, compatible with their safety. Flag states are responsible for ensuring that ships under their jurisdictions comply with these requirements, and require various certificates pursuant to SOLAS as proof of such compliance.

	In 2004, the IMO adopted an International Convention for the Control and Management of Ships&#146; Ballast Water and Sediments, or BWM
	Convention. The BWM Convention&#146;s implementing regulations call for the installation of ballast water treatment systems on newbuilding vessels for which the keel is laid after January&nbsp;1, 2012 and for existing vessels prior to their first
	intermediate or renewal survey after January&nbsp;1, 2016. However, a 2013 IMO Resolution provides that for ships constructed before the BWM Convention enters into force, compliance with the ballast water performance standard will not be required
	until their first renewal survey after entry into force. The BWM Convention will not enter into force, on a retroactive basis, until 12 months after it has been adopted by at least 30 IMO Member States, the combined merchant fleets of which
	represent not less than 35% of the gross tonnage of the world&#146;s merchant shipping. As of February&nbsp;10, 2016, the BWM Convention has been ratified by 47 states but those states constitute only 34.35% of gross tonnage and therefore the

	In 2001, the IMO adopted the International Convention on Civil Liability for Bunker Oil Pollution Damage, or the Bunker Convention, which

	including lubricating oil, used or intended to be used for the operation or propulsion of the ship, and any residues of such oil.&#148; The Bunker Convention also requires registered owners of ships over a certain size to maintain insurance for
	pollution damage in an amount equal to the limits of liability under the applicable national or international limitation regime (but not exceeding the amount calculated in accordance with the Convention on Limitation of Liability for Maritime Claims
	of 1976, as amended). The Bunker Convention took effect on November&nbsp;21, 2008.

	In the United States, the California Attorney General and a coalition of environmental groups
	petitioned the EPA in October 2007 to regulate greenhouse gas emissions from ocean-going ships under the Clean Air Act. Legislation has been introduced into the U.S. Congress to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the United States. In addition,
	EPA&#146;s December 2009 &#147;endangerment finding&#148; regarding greenhouse gases allows the EPA to begin regulating greenhouse gas emissions under existing provisions of the federal Clean Air Act. To date, rules proposed by EPA pursuant to this
	authority have not involved ocean-going vessels.

	In July 2011, parties to MARPOL Annex VI adopted mandatory measures to reduce emissions
	of greenhouse gases from international shipping. The amendments make the Energy Efficiency Design Index (EEDI) mandatory for new ships and the Ship Energy Efficiency Management Plan (SEEMP) is mandatory for all ships. With regard to greenhouse gas
	emissions, there have been discussions in the IMO for the adoption of a market-based mechanism for the reduction of carbon emissions from vessels, such as an emissions trading system or an international greenhouse gas contribution fund, with
	contributions being based on bunker fuel purchases.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The European Union (&#147;EU&#148;) recently adopted Regulation (EU) 2015/757
	concerning the monitoring, reporting and verification of carbon dioxide emissions from vessels, or the MRV Regulation, which was published in the Official Journal on May&nbsp;19, 2015 and went into effect on July&nbsp;1, 2015. The MRV Regulation
	applies to all vessels over 5,000 gross tonnage (except for a few types, including, but not limited to warships and fish catching or processing vessels), irrespective of flag, in respect of carbon dioxide emissions released during voyages within the
	EU as well as EU incoming and outgoing voyages. The first reporting period will commence on January&nbsp;1, 2018. The monitoring, reporting and verification system adopted by the MRV Regulation may be the precursor to a market-based mechanism to be
	adopted in the future.

	The IMO, EU, Canada, the United States and other individual countries, states and provinces continue to evaluate
	various measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from international shipping, which may include some combination of market-based instruments, a carbon tax or other mandatory reduction measures. For example, the United Nations COP21 Climate Change
	Conference in Paris in December 2015, called for reductions in greenhouse gas emissions, but did not include proposals specifically targeting shipping. Any passage of climate control legislation or other regulatory initiatives by the IMO, EU,
	Canada, the United States or other individual jurisdictions where we operate, that restrict emissions of greenhouse gases from vessels, could require us to make significant capital expenditures and may materially increase our operating costs.

	certain portions of the MTSA, the U.S. Coast Guard in July 2003 issued regulations requiring the implementation of certain security requirements aboard vessels operating in waters subject to the jurisdiction of the United States. Similarly, in
	December 2002, amendments to SOLAS created a new chapter of the convention dealing specifically with maritime security. The new chapter came into effect in July 2004 and imposes various detailed security obligations on vessels and port authorities,
	most of which are contained in the newly created International Ship and Port Facilities Security Code, or ISPS Code. Among the various requirements are:

	The cost of vessel security measures has also been affected by the escalation in recent years in the frequency and seriousness of acts of
	piracy against ships, notably off the coast of Somalia, including the Gulf of Aden and Arabian Sea area. Attacks of this kind have commonly resulted in vessels and their crews being detained for several months, and being released only on payment of
	large ransoms. Substantial loss of revenue and other costs may be incurred as a result of such detention. The risk remains of uninsured losses which could significantly affect our business. Costs are incurred in taking additional security measures
	in accordance with Best Management Practices to Deter Piracy, notably those contained in the BMP4 industry standard.

	The container shipping industry suffered a cyclical downturn in 2011 and many container shipping companies reported substantial losses.
	Financial performance of container shipping companies improved in 2012; however, the industry remains under pressure due to oversupply of container ship capacity. While charter payments have been received on a timely basis in 2014 and 2015, we have
	experienced, from time to time, delays in receiving charterhire payments from CMA CGM. For example, in the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2013, between one and three installments were outstanding at any one time, which under the charter contracts are
	due to be paid on the 1

	outstanding. As of December&nbsp;31, 2015, charterhire was up-to-date. If CMA CGM is unable to make charter payments to us, our results of operations and financial condition will be materially adversely affected. If our existing charters with CMA
	CGM were terminated and we were required to recharter at lower rates or if we were unable to find new charters due to market conditions, our results of operations and financial condition would be materially adversely affected.

	Although we
	currently intend to continue to hold and operate all of our vessels, the following table presents information with respect to the carrying value of our vessels and indicates whether their estimated market values based on charter attached valuations
	as at December&nbsp;31, 2015 prepared by an independent ship broking firm are below their carrying values as at December&nbsp;31, 2015. The carrying value of each of the vessels does not necessarily represent its fair market value or the amount that
	could be obtained if the vessel were sold. We would not record an impairment for any of the vessels for which the market value based on charter attached valuations is below its carrying value unless and until we either determine to sell the vessel
	for a loss or determine that the vessel&#146;s carrying amount is not recoverable. We believe that the undiscounted cash flows over the estimated remaining useful lives for those vessels that show estimated market values below their carrying values
	exceed such vessels&#146; carrying values as at December&nbsp;31, 2015, and accordingly have not recorded an impairment charge.

	If time
	charter rates do not improve materially in the near term from current spot market rates, we expect that our average estimated daily time charter rates used in future impairment analyses will decline, resulting in reduced estimated undiscounted
	future net cash flows to an amount which is less than the carrying value of certain vessels. In accordance with our accounting policy, if this occurs, we will be required to recognize a non-cash impairment charge equal to the excess of the impacted
	vessels&#146; carrying value over their fair value. Sensitivity analysis as at December&nbsp;31, 2015 suggests that an impairment charge of approximately $81 million would be triggered by a reduction of 10.0% in the charter rates assumed after
	expiry of the existing charter contracts (and impairment of approximately $39 million for a 5% reduction) under the current methodology. The amount, if any, and timing of any impairment charges we may recognize in the future will depend upon then
	current and expected future charter rates and vessel values, which may differ materially from those used in our estimates at December&nbsp;31, 2015. In addition, vessel values are highly volatile; as such, the estimated market values may not be
	indicative of the current or future market value of our vessels or prices that we could achieve if we were to sell them, with or without charters attached.

	the quoted stock price on the date of grant, as adjusted for estimated dividends forgone until the restricted stock units vest. Compensation expense is recognized based on a graded expense model over the expected vesting period.

	In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (&#147;FASB&#148;) issued an accounting standards update in respect of revenue from
	contracts with customers (Topic 606). The update was originally effective for annual periods beginning after December&nbsp;15, 2016 and early application was not permitted. In August 2015, the FASB issued a further update to defer the effective date
	by one year to annual periods beginning after December&nbsp;15, 2017. We are currently reviewing the impact of adopting this update on our revenue recognition.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	In June 2015, FASB issued an update in respect of Stock Compensation (Topic 718). The amendment requires that a performance target that
	affects vesting and that could be achieved after the requisite service period be treated as a performance condition. The performance condition should not be reflected in estimating the grant-date fair value of the award and the compensation cost
	should be recognized in the period in which it becomes probable that the performance target will be achieved and should represent the compensation cost attributable to the periods for which the requisite service has already been rendered. The
	amendment is effective for annual periods beginning after December&nbsp;15, 2015 and early adoption is permitted. The adoption of this amendment is not expected to lead to any changes to our financial statements.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	In February 2016, FASB issued an accounting standards update in respect of leases (Topic 842). The update makes significant changes to the
	accounting requirements for lessees, who will be required to recognize right-of-use assets with a corresponding lease liability for all but short-term leases. The standard is to be adopted using a modified retrospective transition. The accounting
	requirements for lessors remain largely unchanged. The update is effective for annual periods beginning after December&nbsp;15, 2018 although early application is permitted. We are currently assessing the impact of adopting this update on our
	financial statements.

	$26.3 million, or 19.0%, from operating revenues of $138.6 million for 2014. The increase in operating revenues is mainly due to a 11.7% increase in operating days from 6,146 in 2014 to 6,864 in 2015, the addition of two vessels in March and
	September 2015 and the full year effect of the vessel acquired in October 2014 together with reduced offhire due to fewer drydockings in 2015 and reduced idle time for vessels between charter fixtures. The charter rates on the additional vessels are
	$34,500 per day, significantly higher than the average rate per day of $22,105 earned in 2014. There were 6,893 ownership days in the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2015 with 16 days offhire (including nine days for drydockings) and 13 idle days

	Vessel operating expenses, which relate to the operation of the vessels themselves, were $50.1&nbsp;million for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2015 (or 30% of operating revenues)
	compared to $48.8&nbsp;million for 2014 (or 35% of operating revenues). The average cost per ownership day was $7,269, down $509, or 6.6%, from $7,778 for 2014. The reduction is mainly due to lower crew costs, lower insurance costs on renewal and
	higher costs in 2014 from the cost of bunkers consumed when the two 4,113 TEU vessels were idle between charters, and for repositioning for the commencement of the new charters; $0.7 million (or $104 per day).

	two 4,113 TEU vessels pending re-deployment on new charters, a reduced daily rate on Julie Delmas for 155 days during a period of reduced capability due to a damaged crane and increased offhire, offset by the contribution from OOCL Tianjin from

	Our net cash flow from operating activities derives from revenue received under our charter contracts, which varies directly with
	the number of vessels under charter, days on-hire and charter rates, less operating expenses including crew costs, lubricating oil costs, costs of repairs and maintenance, insurance premiums, general and administrative expenses, interest and other
	financing costs including where appropriate the settlement of interest rate derivatives. In addition, each of our vessels is subject to a drydock every five years. The average cost of the 18 drydockings completed between April 2011 and January 2015
	was $1.3 million with an average loss of revenue of $0.3 million while the relevant vessel was offhire. One vessel completed its scheduled drydocking in 2015. Two vessels were drydocked in each of 2014 and 2013. In addition, CMA CGM Thalassa was
	dry-docked in 2014 on a discretionary basis mainly to modify the bulbous bow to improve fuel efficiency at slow speeds. We have included a schedule of the next anticipated drydocking date for each of our vessels in &#147;Business&#151;Inspection by
	Classification Societies.&#148;

	of each month for vessels on charter to CMA CGM and every two weeks based on the start
	date of the charter in the case of our other charterers. The main factors affecting quarter end cash are the timing of the payment of interest on the notes, which is due to be paid semi-annually on April&nbsp;1 and October&nbsp;1 each year since
	October&nbsp;1, 2014, and the result of the Excess Cash Flow offer up to a maximum of $20 million per annum commencing in 2015, which we are required to make within 120 days of the year end. In April and May 2015, we conducted an Excess Cash Flow
	offer to purchase up to $20.0 million aggregate amount of our notes at a purchase price of 102% of their aggregate principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but not including, the purchase date. The principal amount of notes tendered and
	accepted was $350,000. Beginning on March&nbsp;11, 2015, we are required to make interest payments on the $40.0 million under the revolving credit facility. Assuming LIBOR to be 0.5%, quarterly interest on the fully drawn revolving credit facility
	would amount to approximately $0.4 million. Beginning on September&nbsp;10, 2015, we are required to make interest payments on the $35.0 million drawn under the secured term loan. Assuming LIBOR to be 0.5%, quarterly interest on the fully drawn
	secured term loan would amount to approximately $0.3 million. Further, the secured term loan is repayable in 20 equal quarterly installments of $1.75 million, commencing three months after drawdown on September&nbsp;15, 2015. The secured term loan
	agreement also requires an additional amount of $1.4 million to be repaid in eight equal quarterly installments of $0.175 million beginning on the same day as the 20 equal quarterly installments to provide a reserve for potential enhancement

	chartering arrangements will be sufficient to cover our ship management costs and fees, interest payments under the notes, our revolving credit facility and our secured term loan, including amortization, insurance premiums, vessel taxes, general and
	administrative expenses, dividends on our Series B preferred shares and other costs and any other working capital requirements for the short and medium term and planned drydocking expenses.

	We estimate that the average cost of the 18 drydockings completed between April 2011 and January 2015 was approximately $1.3 million, with an
	average loss of revenue of $0.3 million from offhire. We have included a schedule of the next anticipated drydocking date for each of our vessels in the section of this Annual Report entitled Item&nbsp;4.B. &#147;Information on the
	Company&#151;Business Overview&#151;Inspection by Classification Societies.&#148;

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Our other liquidity requirements include an annual
	Excess Cash Flow offer of up to $20.0 million on our notes and repaying the remaining principal balance of the notes at the stated maturity date on&nbsp;April&nbsp;1, 2019, if they have not been repaid or redeemed earlier. Further, the maturity date
	of the revolving credit facility is October&nbsp;1, 2018. Finally, the secured term loan is repayable in 20 equal quarterly installments of $1.75 million, commencing December&nbsp;10, 2015. The loan agreement requires an additional $175,000 to be
	repaid with each of the first eight quarterly installments to provide a reserve for potential enhancement expenditure on the secured vessel ahead of the expiry of the initial charter to OOCL. These additional installments reduce the debt balance and
	can be redrawn to fund the enhancement work or utilized to permanently reduce the quarterly installments for the remainder of the term of the loan if no such work is required. The secured term loan matures on September&nbsp;10, 2020, five years
	after drawdown, with early repayment, inter alia, if the 2019 Notes are not refinanced by November&nbsp;30, 2018, or if the secured vessel (OOCL Tianjin) ceases to be employed on a charter for a period in excess of 90 days or is sold or is a total
	loss. In addition to funds generated by the business, we may require new borrowings, issuances of equity or other securities, or a combination of the former and the latter to purchase additional vessels and will likely require such further funding
	to meet all of our repayment obligations under the notes.

	The container shipping industry is cyclical, with the demand for container shipping services and therefore
	the demand for container ships, driven by global trade. Between 1997 and 2007, containerized trade exhibited compound annual growth of approximately 10%, with a period of super-cyclical growth from 2002 to mid-2008 fueled partly by significant
	increases in exports from China. The global financial crisis, from late 2008, contributed to a contraction of demand for the first time in the history of containerization, with 2009 volumes falling by 9%. In 2010, demand rebounded, with volume
	growth of almost 13%. During 2011, macroeconomic sentiment softened and containerized trade growth slowed to approximately 7.0%. In 2012, 2013 and 2014, containerized trade grew, year-on-year, by 3.0%, 5.1% and 5.4%, respectively. In 2015,
	containerized trade growth is estimated to have grown approximately 2.3%. In contrast, containership capacity grew by 5.9%, 5.5% and 6.4% in 2012, 2013 and 2014, respectively, and is estimated to have grown by 8.0% in 2015.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The period of super-cyclical growth, combined with operators seeking economies of scale achievable with ever larger vessels, led to a
	significant orderbook of new containerships. In December 2008, the orderbook was estimated to represent over 60% of existing global capacity measured in TEU. Since then, however, the industry has been recalibrating to a lower demand growth paradigm.
	In February 2016, the orderbook-to-fleet ratio stood at just under 20%. Furthermore, scrapping activity reached record levels of over 450,000 TEU in 2013, with another 400,000 TEU scrapped in 2014. Scrapping in 2015 was initially at lower levels,
	but accelerated as the year progressed; almost 25% of the year&#146;s scrapping activity took place in December.

	Vessel newbuilding prices, second hand values and charter rates have tended to be closely
	correlated and are all strongly influenced by the dynamics of supply and demand. From 2005 through 2014, the average newbuilding price for a theoretical 3,500 &#150; 3,600 TEU containership was around $49 million, with average prices ranging between
	$36 million (2009)&nbsp;and $67 million (2008). During the same period, secondhand values for a 10-year old vessel of similar size averaged $29 million and ranged between $10 million (2014)&nbsp;and $52 million (2005). Meantime, spot market charter
	rates for such tonnage averaged about $17,800 per day and ranged between $5,500 (2009)&nbsp;and $44,000 (2005). In February 2016, prevailing spot market charter rates were around $6,000 per day, with newbuilding prices at approximately $38 million
	and second hand values at about $10 million.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Liner companies&#146; results are also highly sensitive to the dynamics of supply and
	demand. Results were adversely affected in 2009, recovered significantly in 2010 and declined again in 2011. Commencing March 2012, operators successfully implemented a series of General Rate Increases (&#147;GRI&#148;s) in a number of trades in
	order to improve financial performance. GRI initiatives continued to be implemented through 2013, 2014 and 2015 to positive, but generally short-lived, effect. Freight rates have remained volatile on most tradelanes and have come under strong
	downward pressure in late 2015 and early 2016.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	In February 2016, the industry was facing significant headwinds in the near term: over 7%
	of the global containership fleet was idle and the macroeconomic backdrop fragile and uncertain. However, with ongoing scrapping, and a comparatively modest orderbook-to-fleet ratio (especially for mid-size and smaller vessels), medium term
	prospects are expected to be better.

	initial shareholders have the right to demand up to two registrations. These shareholders also have the right to request that we file a shelf registration statement with respect to their common shares as soon as the applicable transfer restrictions
	under the shareholders agreement expire. In addition, these shareholders also have piggyback registration rights allowing them to participate in offerings by us and in demand registrations of the other shareholders. We are obligated to pay all

	Class&nbsp;A common shares and Class B common shares as security for a new facility agreement. The amendment provides that if we have received a notice of pledge in respect of these shares, then we may not file a registration statement in respect of

	For foreign
	corporations not engaged in a U.S. trade or business, the United States imposes a 4% U.S. federal income tax (without allowance of any deductions) on the corporation&#146;s U.S. source gross transportation income. For this purpose, transportation
	income includes income from the use, hiring or leasing of a vessel, or the performance of services directly related to the use of a vessel (and thus includes time charter and bareboat charter income). The U.S. source portion of transportation income
	includes 50% of the income attributable to voyages that begin or end (but not both) in the United States. Generally, no amount of the income from voyages that begin and end outside the United States is treated as U.S. source, and consequently none
	of the transportation income attributable to such voyages is subject to this 4% tax. Although the entire amount of transportation income from voyages that begin and end in the United States would be U.S. source, we do not expect to have any
	transportation income from voyages that begin and end in the United States.

	such class that are traded during that year on established securities markets in any other single country. Our Class&nbsp;A common shares are listed on the NYSE and are not listed on any other securities exchange. Therefore, our Class&nbsp;A common

</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The Section&nbsp;883 Regulations also generally provide that stock will be considered to be &#147;regularly traded&#148; on an established
	securities market if one or more classes of stock in the corporation representing in the aggregate more than 50% of the total combined voting power and value of all classes of stock of the corporation are listed on an established securities market
	during the taxable year. However, even if a class of shares is so listed, it is not treated as regularly traded under the Section&nbsp;883 Regulations unless (1)&nbsp;trades are made in the shares on the established securities market, other than in
	minimal quantities, on at least 60 days during the taxable year (or 1/6 of the days in a short taxable year); and (2)&nbsp;the aggregate number of shares traded on the established securities market during the taxable year is at least 10% of the
	average number of outstanding shares of that class during that year (as appropriately adjusted in the case of a short taxable year). Even if these trading frequency and trading volume tests are not satisfied with respect to the Class&nbsp;A common
	shares, however, the Section&nbsp;883 Regulations provide that such tests will be deemed satisfied if the Class&nbsp;A common shares are regularly quoted by dealers making a market in such Class&nbsp;A common shares. While we anticipate that these
	trading frequency and trading volume tests will be satisfied each year, satisfaction of these requirements is outside of our control and, hence, no assurances can be provided that we will satisfy the Publicly Traded Test each year.

	In addition, even if the &#147;primarily and regularly traded&#148; tests described above are satisfied, a class of stock will not be treated

	stock, or 5% Shareholders, own, in the aggregate, 50% or more of the vote and value of that class of stock. This is referred to as the 5% Override Rule. In performing the analysis, we are entitled to rely on current Schedule 13D and 13G filings with
	the SEC to identify our 5% Shareholders, without having to make any independent investigation to determine the identity of the 5% Shareholder. In the event the 5% Override Rule is triggered, the Section&nbsp;883 Regulations provide that the 5%
	Override Rule will nevertheless not apply if the company can establish that among the closely-held group of 5% Shareholders, sufficient shares are owned by 5% Shareholders that are considered to be &#147;qualified shareholders,&#148; as defined

	In order to avoid the application of the PFIC rules discussed above with

	holder that makes a valid QEF election will, in very general terms, be required to include its pro rata share of our ordinary income and net capital gains, unreduced by any prior year losses, in income for each taxable year (as ordinary income and
	long-term capital gain, respectively) and to pay tax thereon, even if the amount of that income is not the same as the distributions paid on the Class&nbsp;A common shares during the year. If we later distribute the income or gain on which the U.S.
	holder has already paid taxes under the QEF rules, the amounts so distributed will not again be subject to tax in the hands of the U.S. holder. A U.S. holder&#146;s tax basis in any Class&nbsp;A common shares as to which a QEF election has been
	validly made will be increased by the amount included in such U.S. holder&#146;s income as a result of the QEF election and decreased by the amount of nontaxable distributions received by the U.S. holder. On the disposition of a common share, a U.S.
	holder making the QEF election generally will recognize capital gain or loss equal to the difference, if any, between the amount realized upon such disposition and its adjusted tax basis in the common share. In general, a QEF election should be made
	on or before the due date for filing a U.S. holder&#146;s federal income tax return for the first taxable year for which we are a PFIC or, if later, the first taxable year for which the U.S. holder held common stock. In this regard, a QEF election
	is effective only if certain required information is made available by the PFIC. Subsequent to the date that we first determine that we are a PFIC, we will use commercially reasonable efforts to provide any U.S. holder of Class&nbsp;A common shares,
	upon request, with the information necessary for such U.S. holder to make the QEF election. If we do not believe that we are a PFIC for a particular year but it is ultimately determined that we were a PFIC, it may not be possible for a holder to

	(1)&nbsp;include as ordinary income the excess, if any, of the fair market value of the Class&nbsp;A common shares at the end of the taxable year over such U.S. holder&#146;s adjusted tax basis in the Class&nbsp;A common shares, and (2)&nbsp;be

	potential market interest rate changes on our financial condition and results of operations. The following sensitivity analysis may have limited use as a benchmark and should not be viewed as a forecast as it does not include a variety of other

	Based on maximum borrowings of $40.0 million

	Internal control over financial reporting cannot provide absolute assurance of achieving financial reporting objectives because of its
	inherent limitations. Internal control over financial reporting is a process that involves human diligence and compliance and is subject to lapses in judgment and breakdowns resulting from human failures. Internal control over financial reporting
	also can be circumvented by collusion or improper override. Because of such limitations, there is a risk that material misstatements may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis by internal control over financial reporting. However, these
	inherent limitations are known features of the financial reporting process, and it is possible to design into the process safeguards to reduce, though not eliminate, this risk. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods
	are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

	To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Global Ship Lease, Inc.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and the related consolidated statements of income, of changes in stockholders&#146; equity and
	cash flows present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Global Ship Lease, Inc. and its subsidiaries (&#147;the Company&#148;) at December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, and the results of their operations and their cash
	flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2015 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective
	internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2015, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). The
	Company&#146;s management is responsible for these financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the
	section entitled &#147;Management&#146;s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting&#148; under Item 15 of Form 20-F. Our responsibility is to express opinions on these financial statements and on the Company&#146;s internal control
	over financial reporting based on our integrated audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain
	reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the financial statements included
	examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement
	presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and
	operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our
	opinions.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	As discussed in Note 2 (b) to the consolidated financial statements, the Company has entered into significant contracts with CMA CGM, a related
	party and the main source of the Company&#146;s operating revenue and consequently the Company is highly dependent on the performance by CMA CGM of its obligations under those contracts which will in turn depend partly on CMA CGM&#146;s financial
	situation.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	A company&#146;s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of
	financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company&#146;s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that
	(i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to
	permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the
	company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company&#146;s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of
	effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

	Most of the Company&#146;s revenues are derived from charters to CMA CGM. The Company is consequently highly dependent on the performance by
	CMA CGM of its obligations under these charters. The container shipping industry is volatile and is currently experiencing a sustained cyclical downturn. Many container shipping companies have reported losses.

	The assumptions used involve a considerable degree of estimation. Actual conditions may

	determination of expected cash flows are (i)&nbsp;charter rates on expiry of existing charters, which are based on a reversion to the historical mean for each category of vessel, adjusted to reflect current and expected market conditions
	(ii)&nbsp;off-hire days, which are based on actual off-hire statistics for the Company&#146;s fleet (iii)&nbsp;operating costs, based on current levels escalated over time based on long term trends (iv)&nbsp;dry docking frequency, duration and cost

	net deferred tax asset will not be realized. At December&nbsp;31, 2015 a deferred tax liability of $20 (2014: $34) was recognized relating to stock based compensation costs charged to the Consolidated Statements of Income in respect of unvested

	In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board

	permitted. In August 2015, the FASB issued a further update to defer the effective date by one year to annual periods beginning after December&nbsp;15, 2017. The Company is currently reviewing the impact of adopting this update on its revenue

	In June 2015, FASB issued an update in respect of Stock Compensation (Topic 718). The amendment requires that a performance
	target that affects vesting and that could be achieved after the requisite service period be treated as a performance condition. The performance condition should not be reflected in estimating the grant-date fair value of the award and the
	compensation cost should be recognized in the period in which it becomes probable that the performance target will be achieved and should represent the compensation cost attributable to the periods for which the requisite service has already been
	rendered. The amendment is effective for annual periods beginning after December&nbsp;15, 2015 and early adoption is permitted. The adoption of this amendment is not expected to lead to any changes to the Company&#146;s financial statements.

	In February 2016, FASB issued an accounting standards update in respect of leases (Topic 842). The update makes significant changes to the
	accounting requirements for lessees, who will be required to recognize right-of-use assets with a corresponding lease liability for all but short-term leases. The standard is to be adopted using a modified retrospective transition. The accounting
	requirements for lessors remain largely unchanged. The update is effective for annual periods beginning after December&nbsp;15, 2018 although early application is permitted. The Company is currently assessing the impact of adopting this update on

	Intangible liabilities relate to management&#146;s estimate of the fair value of below-market charters on
	August&nbsp;14, 2008, the date of the merger (see note 1). The intangible liabilities are being amortized for each vessel over the remaining life of the associated charter. The fair value was estimated by management based on its experience with
	regard to availability of similar vessels, costs to build new vessels and current market demand. The contracted lease rates were compared to the estimated market lease rates for similar vessels. The intangible liabilities were determined by
	discounting the difference in the projected lease cash flows using a discount rate of 8.0% and the remaining length of the charter as the relevant time period.

	Amortization of the intangible liabilities for the 12 initial vessels began on the date following the merger and for the remaining five vessels
	delivered to the Company after the merger, amortization commenced upon delivery. These intangible liabilities are amortized as an increase of time charter revenue over the remaining term of the relevant charter.

	On July&nbsp;29, 2015, the Company entered into a $35,000 secured

	The Secured Term Loan is repayable in 20 equal quarterly instalments, commencing three months after drawdown. $35,000 was drawn

	of the expiry of the initial charter to OOCL. These additional instalments reduce the debt balance and can be redrawn to fund the enhancement work, or utilized to permanently reduce the quarterly instalments for the remainder of the term of the loan

	At December&nbsp;31, 2015, the Company outsourced day to day technical management of 13 of its vessels to CMA Ships Limited (&#147;CMA
	Ships&#148;), a wholly owned subsidiary of CMA CGM. The Company pays CMA Ships an annual management fee of $123 per vessel (2014: $123, 2013: $114) and reimburses costs incurred by CMA Ships on its behalf, mainly being for the provision of crew,
	lubricating oils and routine maintenance. Such reimbursement is subject to a cap per day per vessel, depending on the vessel. The impact of the cap is determined annually on a vessel by vessel basis for so long as the initial charters remain in
	place; no claims have been made under the cap agreement. Ship management fees expensed for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2015 amounted to $1,866 (2014: $2,091, 2013: $1,938).

	Prior to the issue of the 2019 Notes (see note 7(b)) the Company had been exposed to the impact of changes to interest rates
	on the floating rate debt drawn under the previous credit facility (see note 7(a)) which also required the Company to hedge at least 50% of any drawings. Accordingly, the Company entered into interest rate swap agreements to manage the exposure.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; MARGIN-LEFT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	On March&nbsp;19, 2014 the secured credit facility was fully repaid and was replaced with the 2019 Notes, which have a fixed interest
	rate. The $277,000 nominal amount of outstanding interest rate swaps which had hedged the Company&#146;s interest rate risk were terminated accordingly. The cost of the termination included an element of unsettled payments due under the swap
	agreements up to March&nbsp;19, 2014 amounting to $307. This amount is included in the Consolidated Statements of Income as a realised loss on derivative instruments.

	During the periods when the interest rate swaps were outstanding, they were &#147;marked to market&#148; at each reporting date end and
	recorded at their fair values. This generated unrealized gains and losses. The unrealized gain on interest rate derivatives for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2014 was $1,944 (2013: $14,302).

	None of the Company&#146;s interest rate agreements qualified for hedge accounting and therefore the net changes in the fair value of the
	interest rate derivative assets and liabilities at each reporting period were reflected in the current period operations as unrealized gains and losses on derivatives. Cash flows related to interest rate derivatives (initial payments for the
	derivatives, periodic cash settlements and termination payments) are included within cash flows from investing activities in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.

	Restricted stock units granted to four members of management on September&nbsp;2, 2011 were to vest
	over two years; half during September and October 2012 and the remaining half during September and October 2013. In March 2012, these grants were amended and restated to provide that vesting would occur only when the individual leaves employment,
	for whatever reason, provided that this was after September&nbsp;30, 2012 in respect of half of the grant and after September&nbsp;30, 2013 for the other half of the grant. Restricted stock units granted to management on March&nbsp;13, 2012 are
	expected to vest when the individual leaves employment, provided that this is after September&nbsp;30, 2014 and is not as a result of resignation or termination for cause. Restricted stock units granted to management on March&nbsp;7, 2013 are

	Using the graded vesting method of expensing the restricted stock unit grants, the weighted average fair value of the stock units is recognized
	as compensation costs in the consolidated statement of income over the vesting period. The fair value of the restricted stock units for this purpose is calculated by multiplying the number of stock units by the fair value of the shares at the grant
	date, which is discounted for dividends forfeited over the vesting period. The Company has not factored any anticipated forfeiture into these calculations based on the limited number of participants.

	For the grants issued on March&nbsp;13, 2012 and March&nbsp;7, 2013, the fair value at the grant date was the closing price for the common
	stock on that date. The share value has not been discounted as no dividends were expected to be paid on the common stock at that time.
