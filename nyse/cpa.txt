	EBITDA represents net income plus the sum of interest expense, income taxes, depreciation, amortization and impairment minus the sum of interest capitalized and interest income. EBITDA is presented as supplemental
	information because we believe it is a useful indicator of our operating performance and is useful in comparing our operating performance with other companies in the airline industry. However, EBITDA should not be considered in isolation, as a
	substitute for net income prepared in accordance with IFRS or as a measure of a company&#146;s profitability. In addition, our calculation of EBITDA may not be comparable to other companies&#146; similarly titled measures. The following table
	presents a reconciliation of our net income to EBITDA for the specified periods: Aircraft rentals represent a significant operating expense of our business. Because we leased several of our aircraft during the periods presented, we believe that when
	assessing our EBITDA you should also consider the impact of our aircraft rentals.

	substantial amount of cash to fund. We also periodically run special promotional fare campaigns, particularly in connection with the opening of new routes. Promotional fares can have the effect of increasing load factors while reducing our yield on
	such routes during the period that they are in effect. The number of markets we serve and flight frequencies depend on our ability to identify the appropriate geographic markets upon which to focus and to gain suitable airport access and route
	approval in these markets. There can be no assurance that the new markets we enter will yield passenger traffic that is sufficient to make our operations in those new markets profitable. Any condition that would prevent or delay our access to key
	airports or routes, including limitations on the ability to process more passengers, the imposition of flight capacity restrictions, the inability to secure additional route rights under bilateral agreements or the inability to maintain our existing
	slots and banks and obtain additional slots and flight banks, could constrain the expansion of our operations.

	The structure of our flight operations follows what is known in the airline industry as a &#147;hub-and-spoke&#148; model. This
	model aggregates passengers by operating flights from a number of &#147;spoke&#148; origins to a central hub through which they are transported to their final destinations. In recent years, many traditional hub-and-spoke operators have faced
	significant and increasing competitive pressure from low-cost, point-to-point carriers on routes with sufficient demand to sustain point-to-point service. A point-to-point structure enables airlines to focus on the most profitable, high-demand
	routes and to offer greater convenience and, in many instances, lower fares. As demand for air travel in Latin America increases, some of our competitors have initiated non-stop service between destinations that we currently serve through our hub in
	Panama. Non-stop service, which bypasses our hub in Panama, is more convenient and possibly less expensive than our connecting service and could significantly decrease demand for our service to those destinations. We believe that competition from
	point-to-point carriers will be directed towards the largest markets that we serve and is likely to continue at this level or intensify in the future. As a result, the effect of competition on us could be significant and could have a material

	On November&nbsp;25, 2005, the Executive Branch of the Government of Panama promulgated a decree stating that the &#147;substantial

	decree has the force of law for so long as it remains in effect, it does not supersede the Aviation Act, and it can be modified or superseded at any time by a future Executive Branch decree. Additionally, the decree has no binding effect on
	regulatory authorities of other countries whose bilateral agreements impose Panamanian ownership and control limitations on us. We cannot ensure that the decree will not be challenged, modified or superseded in the future, that CIASA will continue
	to own a majority of the Class B shares, or that record ownership of a majority of our Class B shares by Panamanian entities will be sufficient to satisfy the &#147;substantial ownership&#148; requirement of the Aviation Act and the decree. A change

	ownership should be determined on the basis of our direct and indirect ownership, could cause us to lose our license to operate our airline in Panama. Likewise, if a foreign regulatory authority were to determine that our direct or indirect

	The FAA periodically audits the aviation regulatory authorities of other

	Our business is heavily dependent on our operations at our hub at Panama City&#146;s Tocumen International Airport. Substantially all of our
	Copa flights either depart from or arrive at our hub. Our operations and growth strategy is therefore highly dependent on its facilities and infrastructure, including the success of its multi-phase expansion projects, certain of which have been
	completed and others that are underway and are expected to be completed in 2017. Due to the magnitude of the construction required for a proposed new south terminal, we may experience logistical issues and/or be subject to increased passenger taxes

	In addition, the hub-and-spoke structure of our operations is
	particularly dependent on the on-time arrival of tightly coordinated groupings of flights (or banks) to ensure that passengers can make timely connections to continuing flights. Like other airlines, we are subject to delays caused by factors beyond
	our control, including air traffic congestion at airports, adverse weather conditions and increased security measures. Delays inconvenience passengers, reduce aircraft utilization and increase costs, all of which in turn negatively affect our
	profitability. In addition, at its current utilization level, Tocumen International Airport has limited fuel storage capacity. In the event there is a disruption in the transport of fuel to the airport, we may be forced to suspend flights until the
	fuel tanks can be refueled. A significant interruption or disruption in service or fuel at Tocumen International Airport could have a serious impact on our business, financial condition and operating results.

	Tocumen International Airport is operated by a corporation that is owned and controlled by the government of the Republic of Panama. We depend

	operations and future plans for expansion. The corporation that operates Tocumen International Airport does not enter into any formal, written leases or other agreements with airlines to govern rights to use the airport&#146;s jet ways or aircraft
	parking spaces. Therefore, we would not have contractual recourse if the airport authority assigned new capacity to competing airlines, reassigned our resources to other aircraft operators, raised fees or discontinued investments in the

	If there is objective evidence

	The airline industry is by nature cyclical and seasonal, and our operating results may vary from quarter to quarter. In general,
	demand for air travel is higher in the third and fourth quarters, particularly in international markets, because of the increase in vacation travel during these periods relative to the remainder of the year. We tend to experience the highest levels
	of traffic and revenue in July and August, with a smaller peak in traffic in December and January. We generally experience our lowest levels of passenger traffic in April and May. Given our high proportion of fixed costs, seasonality can affect our
	profitability from quarter to quarter. Demand for air travel is also affected by factors such as economic conditions, war or the threat of war, fare levels and weather conditions.

	During the last five years, the Venezuelan government has implemented several fixed exchange rates which resulted in significant devaluations

	preferential rate of 6.3 bolivars per dollar, because none of the regulations instituting the new rates expressly applied to airlines&#146; past balances, and due to the status of negotiations between the Panamanian and Venezuelan governments
	regarding the timing and exchange rate applicable to the repatriation of funds held in local currency not only for the airline industry but also for other affected Panamanian industries.&nbsp;After determining that we may not be able to repatriate
	those funds at the preferential official exchange rate due to the high degree of political and economic uncertainty, we recognized $430.2 million as a foreign currency translation loss as of December&nbsp;31, 2015 using the &#147;Sistema
	Complementario Flotante&#148; rate of 198.69 bolivars per U.S. dollar, mostly related to sales in 2013. We classified our remaining $13.4 million as cash and cash equivalents, which we expect to use over the next months as part of our normal

	consolidations characterize the airline industry and tend to intensify competition. In 2011, the LAN Group acquired Aires, a low-cost Colombian air carrier, which is now operated as LAN Colombia. In 2012, the LAN Group acquired the Brazilian TAM
	Airlines, which resulted in the creation of the LATAM Airlines Group (LATAM). In addition, several other air carriers have reorganized in recent years, including certain of our competitors, such as Avianca-Taca and Delta, and have benefited from

	In addition, since
	2008, the airline industry has experienced increased consolidation and changes in international alliances, both of which have altered and will continue to alter the competitive landscape in the industry by resulting in the formation of airlines and
	alliances with increased financial resources, more extensive global networks and altered cost structures. For example, Grupo Viva is a new and expanding low-cost competitor created by Irelandia Aviation and Grupo IAMSA, which operates flights in
	Colombia and Mexico. Although we intend to compete vigorously and maintain our strong competitive position in the industry, Avianca-Taca and LAN Colombia represent a significant portion of the domestic market in Colombia and have access to greater
	resources as a result of their recent combinations. Therefore, Copa faces stronger competition than in recent years, and its prior results may not be indicative of its future performance. In addition, both we and Avianca-Taca joined Star Alliance on

	We must constantly react to changes in prices and services offered by our competitors to remain competitive. The airline industry is highly
	susceptible to price discounting, particularly because airlines incur very low marginal costs for providing service to passengers occupying otherwise unsold seats. Carriers use discount fares to stimulate traffic during periods of lower demand to
	generate cash flow and to increase market share. Any lower fares offered by one airline are often matched by competing airlines, which often results in lower industry yields with little or no increase in traffic levels. Price competition among
	airlines in the future could lead to lower fares or passenger traffic on some or all of our routes, which could negatively impact our profitability. We cannot be certain that any of our competitors will not undercut our fares in the future or
	increase capacity on routes in an effort to increase their respective market share. Although we intend to compete vigorously and to assert our rights against any predatory conduct, such activity by other airlines could reduce the level of fares or
	passenger traffic on our routes to the point where profitable levels of operations could not be maintained. Due to our smaller size and financial resources compared to several of our competitors, we may be less able to withstand aggressive marketing
	tactics or fare wars engaged in by our competitors should such events occur.

	class service and fewer in-flight amenities. As evidenced by the operations of Gol Intelligent Airlines or Gol, which continues to grow both in Brazil as well as in other South American countries; Grupo Viva, which is growing in domestic and

	Fuel costs constitute a significant portion of our total operating expenses,
	representing approximately 30.4% of operating expenses in 2015, 37.6% in 2014 and 37.5% in 2013. Jet fuel costs have been subject to wide fluctuations as a result of increases in demand, sudden disruptions in and other concerns about global supply,
	as well as market speculation. Fuel prices reached record levels during the middle of 2008, decreased substantially in 2009, and have fluctuated up and down for the following years, reaching a new low in 2015. Both the cost and availability of fuel
	are subject to many economic, political, weather, environmental and other factors and events occurring throughout the world that we can neither control nor accurately predict, including international political and economic circumstances such as the
	political instability in major oil-exporting countries in Latin America, Africa and Asia. If a future fuel supply shortage were to arise as a result of production curtailments by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, or OPEC, a
	disruption of oil imports, supply disruptions resulting from severe weather or natural disasters, the continued unrest in the Middle East or otherwise, higher fuel prices or further reductions of scheduled airline services could result. We cannot

	We routinely enter into derivative
	contracts for a portion of our fuel needs to protect against rising fuel costs, although in recent periods, we have entered into such arrangements on a much more selective basis. These agreements provide only limited protection against increases in
	the price of fuel or our counterparties&#146; inability to perform under the agreement, can be less effective during volatile market conditions and may be unavailable to us in the event of a deterioration in our financial condition. Because of the
	large volume of jet fuel that we consume in our business, entering into derivative contracts for any substantial portion of our future projected fuel requirements is costly. Fuel prices are likely to increase above their current levels and may do so
	in the near future, which could materially and negatively affect our operating results. Conversely, declines in fuel prices may increase the costs associated with our fuel hedging arrangements to the extent we have entered into swaps or collars.
	Swaps and put options sold as part of a collar obligate us to make payments to the counterparty upon settlement of the contracts if the price of the commodity hedged falls below the agreed upon amount. Historically, declining crude oil prices have
	resulted in our being required to post significant amounts of collateral to cover potential amounts owed with respect to swap and collar contracts that have not yet settled. Additionally, lower fuel prices may result in lower fares through the
	reduction or elimination of fuel surcharges.

	Different countries calculate income in different ways, but they are typically derived from sales in the applicable country multiplied by our

	operations to that particular country. The methodology for multinational transportation company sourcing of revenues and expenses is not always specifically prescribed in the relevant tax regulations, and therefore is subject to interpretation by

	In 2010, the Panamanian tax code for
	the airline industry was amended to make taxes based on net income earned for traffic whose origin or final destination is the Republic of Panama. The applicable tax rate for 2010 was 27.5%. For 2011 and going forward, the applicable tax rate has
	been established at 25.0%. On December&nbsp;30, 2013, the Panamanian National Assembly approved amendments to the tax code that would have changed Panama&#146;s tax system from a territoriality regime to a global tax regime, subject to certain
	exceptions. Although these amendments were repealed on January&nbsp;10, 2014 by the Assembly, the Panamanian tax code could be subject to further change in the future, which could materially increase our effective tax rate.

	While geographic diversity helps reduce our
	exposure to risks in any one country, we operate primarily within Latin America and are subject to a full range of risks associated with our international operations. These risks may include unstable political or economic conditions, lack of
	well-established or reliable legal systems, exchange controls and other limits on our ability to repatriate earnings and changeable legal and regulatory requirements. In Venezuela and Argentina, for example, we and other airlines and foreign
	companies may only repatriate cash through specific governmental programs, which may effectively preclude us from repatriating cash for periods of time. Each of Venezuela and Argentina have also experienced difficult political conditions and
	declines in the rate of economic growth in recent periods as well as governmental actions that have adversely impacted businesses that conduct operations in those countries. Recently, presidential elections occurred in Argentina, which resulted in
	Mr.&nbsp;Mauricio Macri being elected president of Argentina. The Macri administration has announced and begun to implement several significant economic and policy reforms since taking office in December 2015, but the impact of these measures and
	any future measures taken by the new administration on the Argentine economy as a whole and the financial sector in particular cannot be predicted. In addition, there is uncertainty as to which measures announced during Macri presidential campaign
	will be taken and what the timing will be for any of those measures. Political parties opposed to the Macri administration retained a majority of the seats in the Argentina Congress in the recent elections, which will require the Macri
	administration to seek political support from the opposition for its economic proposals and creates further uncertainty in the ability of the Macri administration to pass any measures which it may expect to implement. Inflation, any decline in GDP
	or other future economic, social and political developments in Argentina may adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations. For the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2015 sales in local currency in Venezuela and Argentina represented
	0.05% and 6.3% of our total sales, respectively. See &#147;Our substantial cash balances in Venezuelan bolivars are subject to unfavorable exchange controls, and our Venezuelan operations could be adversely affected by conditions in Venezuela or by

	Under Panamanian law, the protections afforded to minority shareholders are different from, and much more limited than, those in the United
	States and some other Latin American countries. For example, the legal framework with respect to shareholder disputes is less developed under Panamanian law than under U.S. law and there are different procedural requirements for bringing shareholder
	lawsuits, including shareholder derivative suits. As a result, it may be more difficult for our minority shareholders to enforce their rights against us or our directors or controlling shareholder than it would be for shareholders of a U.S. company.
	In addition, Panamanian law does not afford minority shareholders as many protections for investors through corporate governance mechanisms as in the United States and provides no mandatory tender offer or similar protective mechanisms for minority
	shareholders in the event of a change in control. While our Articles of Incorporation provide limited rights to holders of our Class&nbsp;A shares to sell their shares at the same price as CIASA in the event that a sale of Class B shares by CIASA

	Copa was

	B. Business Overview
</B>
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:8%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	We
	are a leading Latin American provider of airline passenger and cargo service through our two principal operating subsidiaries, Copa Airlines and Copa Colombia. Copa Airlines operates from its strategically-located position in the Republic of Panama,
	and Copa Colombia provides service within Colombia and international flights from various cities in Colombia to Panama, Venezuela, Ecuador, Mexico, Cuba, Guatemala and Costa Rica. We currently operate a fleet of 100 aircraft, 77 Boeing 737-Next
	Generation aircraft and 23 Embraer 190 aircraft to meet our growing capacity requirements. As of December&nbsp;31, 2015 the Company has two purchase contracts with Boeing: the first contract entails eleven firm orders of Boeing 737 Next Generation
	aircraft, which will be delivered between 2016 and 2018, the second contract entails 65 firm orders of Boeing 737 MAX aircraft, which will be delivered between 2018 and 2025.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:8%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Copa currently offers approximately 360 daily scheduled flights among 73 destinations in 31 countries in North, Central and South America and
	the Caribbean from its Panama City hub. Copa provides passengers with access to flights to more than 200 other destinations through codeshare arrangements with UAL and other airlines pursuant to which each airline places its name and flight
	designation code on the other&#146;s flights. Through its Panama City hub, Copa is able to consolidate passenger traffic from multiple points to serve each destination effectively.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:8%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Copa began its strategic alliance with Continental in 1998. Since then, it has conducted joint marketing and codesharing arrangements. On
	October&nbsp;1, 2010, Continental merged with United Airlines. The combined carrier took the United Airlines name but uses the former Continental&#146;s livery and logo. All of the service and alliance agreements we had in place with Continental
	have been transferred to the combined UAL entity. We believe that Copa&#146;s co-branding and joint marketing activities, which continue with UAL, have enhanced its brand in Latin America, and that the relationship with UAL has afforded it
	cost-related benefits, such as improved purchasing power in negotiations with aircraft vendors and insurers. We are currently advanced in mutually beneficial negotiations with UAL and expect to extend the term, and continue with, an updated Alliance
	agreement from May 2016 forward. Due to the long-standing alliance relationship with Continental, and in order to ensure Copa remained fully aligned with Continental on a number of important joint initiatives, Copa officially joined Star Alliance on
	June&nbsp;21, 2012, which Continental had joined at the end of 2009.

	Since January 2001, we have grown significantly and have established
	a track record of consistent profitability, with the one exception of 2015. Although in 2015 our revenues and margins have decreased as compared to 2014, our total operating revenues have increased from $0.3 billion in 2001 to $2.3 billion in 2015
	while our operating margins have also increased from 8.6% to 11.8% over the same period.

	Our &#147;Hub of the Americas&#148; airport is strategically located.
</I>
	We believe that Copa&#146;s base of operations at the geographically central location of Tocumen International Airport in Panama City, Panama
	provides convenient connections to our principal markets in North, Central and South America and the Caribbean, enabling us to consolidate traffic to serve several destinations that do not generate enough demand to justify point-to-point service.
	Flights from Panama operate with few service disruptions due to weather, contributing to high completion factors and on-time performance. Tocumen International Airport&#146;s sea-level altitude allows our aircraft to operate without the performance
	restrictions they would be subject to at higher-altitude airports. We believe that Copa&#146;s hub in Panama allows us to benefit from Panama City&#146;s status as a center for financial services, shipping and commerce and from Panama&#146;s stable,
	dollar-based economy, free-trade zone and growing tourism.

	approximately 72% of total real GDP in Panama, a higher percentage of GDP than the service sector represents in most other Latin American countries. The IMF currently estimates Panama&#146;s population to be approximately 3.8&nbsp;million in 2015,
	with the majority of the population concentrated in Panama City, where our hub at Tocumen International Airport is located. We believe the combination of a stable, service-oriented economy and steady population growth has helped drive our domestic
	origin and destination passenger traffic.

	Domestic travel within Panama primarily consists of individuals visiting families as well as
	domestic and foreign tourists visiting the countryside. Most of this travel is done via ground transportation, and its main flow is to and from Panama City, where most of the economic activity and population is concentrated. Demand for domestic air
	travel is growing and relates primarily to leisure travel from foreign and local tourists. Since January 2015, Copa has operated three daily flights to the second-largest city in Panama, David in Chiriqui. The remaining market is served primarily by
	one local airline, Air Panama, which operates a fleet primarily consisting of turbo prop aircraft generally with less than 50 seats. This airline offers limited international service and operates in the domestic terminal of Panama City, which is
	located 30 minutes by car from Tocumen International Airport.

	Colombia is the third largest country in Latin America in terms of
	population, with a population of approximately 48.6&nbsp;million in 2015 according to the IMF, and has a land area of approximately 440,000 square miles. Colombia&#146;s GDP is estimated to be $274 billion for 2015, and per capita income was
	approximately $5.7 thousand (current prices) according to the International Monetary Fund. Colombia&#146;s geography is marked by the Andean mountains and an inadequate road and rail infrastructure, making air travel a convenient and attractive
	transportation alternative. Colombia shares a border with Panama, and for historic, cultural and business reasons it represents a significant market for many Panamanian businesses.

	As of December&nbsp;31, 2015, Copa provided regularly-scheduled flights to 73 cities in North, Central and South America and the Caribbean. The
	majority of Copa flights operate through our hub in Panama City which allows us to transport passengers and cargo among a large number of destinations with service that is more frequent than if each route were served directly.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:8%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	We believe our hub-and-spoke model is the most efficient way for us to operate our business since most of the origination/destination city
	pairs we serve do not generate sufficient traffic to justify a point-to-point service. Also, since we serve many countries, it would be very difficult to obtain the bilateral route rights necessary to operate a competitive point-to-point system.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:8%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Copa schedules its hub flights using a &#147;connecting bank&#148; structure, where flights arrive at the hub at approximately the same
	time and depart a short time later. In June 2011, we increased our banks of flights from four to six a day. This allowed us to increase efficiency in the use of hub infrastructure in addition to providing more time of day choices to passengers.

	As a part of our strategic relationship with UAL, Copa provides flights through codesharing arrangements to over 200 other destinations. In
	addition to codeshares provided with our Star Alliance partners, Copa also has codesharing arrangements in place with several other carriers, including KLM, Gol, and Aeromexico.

	In addition to increasing the frequencies to destinations we already serve, Copa&#146;s business strategy is also focused on adding new
	destinations across Latin America, the Caribbean and North America in order to increase the attractiveness of our Hub of the Americas at Tocumen International Airport hub for intra-American traffic. We currently plan to introduce new destinations
	and to increase frequencies to many of the destinations that Copa currently serves. Our Embraer 190 aircraft, together with the Boeing 737-Next Generation aircraft, allow us to improve our service by increasing frequencies and service to new
	destinations with the right-sized aircraft.

	initially signed for a period of ten years. In November 2005, Copa and Continental amended and restated these agreements and extended their term through the year 2016. Currently both carriers are working together to renew and extend the duration of
	these agreements.

	Copa Holdings is also a party to a supplemental agreement with CIASA and Continental entered into in connection with
	Continental&#146;s May 2008 offering of our shares. The supplemental agreement terminates the shareholders&#146; agreement between the Company, CIASA and Continental that existed prior to Continental&#146;s exit and further amends the amended and
	restated registration rights agreement between the parties. Pursuant to the supplemental agreement, Continental received the right to appoint a member of its senior management to our Board of Directors during the term of our alliance agreement with
	Continental.

	On October&nbsp;1, 2010, Continental merged with United Airlines and became a wholly-owned subsidiary of UAL. All the
	benefits from our previous alliance with Continental have been recognized by UAL. Our alliance relationship with Continental enjoyed a grant of antitrust immunity from the U.S. Department of Transportation, or DOT. The DOT has issued a &#147;route
	transfer order&#148; document after Continental merged with UAL, whereby the existing antitrust immunity grant between Continental and Copa Airlines is now in effect between UAL and Copa Airlines.

	As a result of our alliance, we have benefited from Continental&#146;s and now UAL&#146;s expertise and experience over the past decade. For
	example, prior to July 2015 when we launched our own frequent flyer program, ConnectMiles we adopted Continental&#146;s OnePass (now UAL&#146;s MileagePlus) frequent flyer program and rolled out a co-branded joint product in much of Latin America,
	which enabled Copa to develop brand loyalty among travelers. The co-branding of the OnePass (now MileagePlus) loyalty programs helped to leverage the brand recognition that Continental already enjoyed across Latin America and has enabled Copa to
	compete more effectively against regional competitors such as Avianca-Taca and the Oneworld alliance represented by American Airlines and LAN Airlines. We also share UAL&#146;s Sceptre inventory management software, which allows Copa to pool spare
	parts with the larger airline and to rely on UAL to provide engineering support for maintenance projects. We have also been able to take advantage of UAL&#146;s purchasing power and negotiate more competitive rates for spare parts and third-party
	maintenance work. In addition to the Sceptre system, we have adopted several important information technology systems, such as the &#147;SHARES&#148; computer reservation system in an effort to maintain commonality with UAL.

	In 2007, Copa joined the SkyTeam global alliance as an Associate Member, in part due to the support and sponsorship of
	Continental.&nbsp;Continental left the SkyTeam Alliance and joined the Star Alliance effective the fourth quarter of 2009. Due to the long-standing alliance relationship with Continental, and in order to ensure Copa remained fully aligned with
	Continental on a number of important joint initiatives, Copa also exited the SkyTeam Alliance during the fourth quarter of 2009 and officially joined Star Alliance on June&nbsp;21, 2012.

	Our alliance with UAL is governed by several interrelated agreements. Each of the agreements, as amended and restated, will expire three years
	after one of the parties has given written notice to the other. In May 2013, UAL provided us with such notice. We are currently advanced in mutually beneficial negotiations with UAL and expect to extend the term, and continue with, an updated

	Under our current alliance agreement with UAL, both entities agree
	to continue their codesharing relationship with extensions as they feel appropriate and to work to maintain our antitrust immunity with the DOT. In order to support the codesharing relationship, the alliance agreement also contains provisions
	mandating a continued frequent flyer relationship between the airlines, setting minimum levels of quality of service for the airlines and encouraging cooperation in marketing and other operational initiatives. Under the alliance agreement, UAL and
	Copa are prohibited from entering into commercial agreements with certain classes of competing airlines, and the agreement requires both parties to include each other, as practicable, in their commercial relationships with other airlines. Other than
	by expiration as described above, the agreement is also terminable by either airline in

	. Approximately 66.0% of sales during 2015 were completed through travel agents, including
	OTAs, and other airlines while approximately 34.0% were direct sales via our city ticket offices (&#147;CTO&#148;s), call centers, airport counters or website. Travel agents receive base commissions, not including back-end incentive payments,
	ranging from 0% to 6% depending on the country. The weighted average rate for these commissions during 2015 was 2.09%. In recent years, base commissions have decreased significantly in most markets as more efficient back-end incentive programs have

	Travel agents obtain airline travel information and

	participates actively in all major international GDSs, including SABRE, Amadeus, Galileo and Worldspan. In return for access to these systems, Copa pays transaction fees that are generally based on the number of reservations booked through each
	system.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:8%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Copa has a sales and marketing network consisting of 71 domestic and international ticket offices, including airport and city
	ticket offices located in Panama and Colombia. During the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2015, approximately 12.7% and 3.0% of its sales were booked through our ticket counters and call center, respectively.

	The call center that operates Copa&#146;s reservations and sales services handles calls from Panama as well as most other countries to which

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:8%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	We face considerable competition throughout our route network. Overall airline industry profit margins are low and industry earnings are
	volatile. Airlines compete in the areas of pricing, scheduling (frequency and flight times), on-time performance, frequent flyer programs and other services. Strategic alliances, bankruptcy restructurings and industry consolidations characterize the
	airline industry and tend to intensify competition.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:8%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Copa competes with a number of other airlines that currently serve the routes on
	which we operate, including Avianca, American Airlines, Delta Airlines, AeroMexico, LATAM Group and Viva Colombia, among others. In order to remain competitive, we must constantly react to changes in prices and services offered by our competitors.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:8%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	In 2011, the LAN Group acquired Aires, a low-cost Colombian air carrier, which is now operated as LAN Colombia. In 2012, the LAN Group
	acquired the Brazilian TAM Airlines, which resulted in the creation of the LATAM Airlines Group (LATAM). In addition, several other air carriers have reorganized in recent years, including certain of our competitors, such as Avianca-Taca and Delta,
	and have benefited from lower operating costs and fare discounting in order to maintain cash flows and to enhance continued customer loyalty. For example, Grupo Viva is a new and expanding low-cost competitor created by Irelandia Aviation and Grupo
	IAMSA.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:8%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	In addition, since 2008, the airline industry has experienced increased consolidation and changes in international alliances, both
	of which have altered and will continue to alter the competitive landscape in the industry by resulting in the formation of airlines and alliances with increased financial resources, more extensive global networks and altered cost structures.
	Although we intend to compete vigorously and maintain our strong competitive position in the industry, Avianca-Taca and LAN Colombia represent a significant portion of the domestic market in Colombia and have access to greater resources as a result
	of their recent combinations.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:8%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The airline industry is highly susceptible to price discounting, particularly because airlines incur very
	low marginal costs for providing service to passengers occupying otherwise unsold seats. Carriers use discount fares to stimulate traffic during periods of lower demand to generate cash flow and to increase market share. Any lower fares offered by
	one airline are often matched by competing airlines, which frequently results in lower industry yields with little or no increase in traffic levels. Price competition among airlines in the future could lead to lower fares or passenger traffic on
	some or all of our routes, which could negatively impact our profitability. We cannot assure you that any of our competitors will not undercut our fares in the future or increase capacity on routes in an effort to increase their respective market
	share. Although we intend to compete vigorously and to assert our rights against any predatory conduct, such activity by other airlines could reduce the level of fares or passenger traffic on our routes to the point where profitable levels of
	operations could not be maintained. Due to our smaller size and financial resources compared to several of our competitors, we may be less able to withstand aggressive marketing tactics or fare wars engaged in by our competitors should such events
	occur.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:8%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	In addition, Copa officially joined Star Alliance on June&nbsp;21, 2012. One of our main competitors, Avianca, also joined Star
	Alliance in 2012. Although we believe that the benefits associated with participating in Star Alliance outweigh the risk of sharing an alliance with Avianca, we cannot predict the extent to which participating in the same global alliance as one of
	our direct competitors may impact our revenues, our ability for future growth, or any additional implications to our current operations.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:8%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Airlines based in other countries may also receive subsidies, tax incentives or other state aid from their respective governments, which are
	not provided by the Panamanian government. The commencement of, or increase in, service on the routes we serve by existing or new carriers could negatively impact our operating results. Likewise, competitors&#146; service on routes that we are
	targeting for expansion may make those expansion plans less attractive. We must constantly react to changes in prices and services offered by our competitors to remain competitive.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:8%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Traditional hub-and-spoke carriers in the United States and Europe have in recent years faced substantial and increasing competitive pressure
	from low-cost carriers offering discounted fares. The low-cost carriers&#146; operations are typically characterized by point-to-point route networks focusing on the highest demand city pairs, high aircraft utilization, single class service and
	fewer in-flight amenities. As evidenced by the operations of competitors in Brazil and other South American countries and several new low-cost carriers which have recently launched service, the &#147;low-cost carrier&#148; business model appears to
	be gaining acceptance in the Latin American aviation industry, and we may face new and substantial competition from low-cost carriers in the future.

	Our focus on profitable
	operations means that we periodically review our fleet composition. As a result, our fleet composition changes over time when we conclude that adding other types of aircraft will help us achieve this goal. The introduction of any new type of
	aircraft to our fleet is only done if, after careful consideration, we determine that such a step will improve our profitability. In line with this philosophy, after conducting a careful cost-benefit analysis, we added the Embraer 190 aircraft
	because its combination of smaller size and highly efficient operating characteristics made it the ideal aircraft to serve new mid-sized markets and to increase frequency to existing destinations. The Embraer 190 incorporates advanced design
	features, such as integrated avionics, fly-by-wire flight controls, and CF34-10 engines made by General Electric. The Embraer E190 has a range of approximately 2,000 nautical miles, enabling it to fly to a wide range of destinations from short-haul
	to certain medium-haul destinations. We have configured Copa&#146;s Embraer aircraft with a business class section similar to the business class section we have on our Boeing 737-Next Generation aircraft. Following our growth strategy, we have
	placed an order of 65 Boeing 737-MAX 8 and 9 aircraft. The 737-MAX will provide additional benefits to the current fleet such as fuel efficiency, longer range and additional capacity compared to the current Copa seat configuration.

	The
	maintenance performed on our aircraft can be divided into two general categories: line and heavy maintenance. Line maintenance consists of routine, scheduled maintenance checks on our aircraft, including pre-flight, daily and overnight checks,
	&#147;A-checks&#148; and any diagnostics and routine repairs. Copa&#146;s line maintenance is performed by Copa&#146;s own technicians at our base in Panama and at stations outside Panama by Copa Airlines, Copa Colombia employees or third-party
	contractors. Heavy maintenance consists of more complex inspections and overhauls, including &#147;C-checks,&#148; and servicing of the aircraft that cannot be accomplished during an overnight visit. Maintenance checks are performed intermittently
	as determined by the aircraft manufacturer. These checks are based on the number of hours or calendar months flown. Historically we have contracted with certified outside maintenance providers, such as COOPESA, which is certified as an authorized
	repair station by the FAA and the AAC, for all heavy aircraft maintenance services. In October of 2010, Copa decided to begin performing a portion of the heavy maintenance works in-house, and the hiring, training, facility and tooling setup, as well
	as enhancing certain support shops, were completed during a ten-month period. Copa acquired the required certifications by the local authorities in August 2011 in connection with its first in-house C-check and performed its second C-check in October
	of the same year. In 2015, 19 of the 33 heavy maintenance checks were successfully performed in-house.

	Copa Airlines and Copa Colombia employ, system-wide, over 518 maintenance professionals, including engineers, supervisors,
	technicians and mechanics, who perform maintenance in accordance with maintenance programs that are established by the manufacturer and approved and certified by international aviation authorities. Every mechanic is trained in factory procedures and
	goes through our own rigorous in-house training program. Every mechanic is licensed by the AAC and approximately 34 of our mechanics are also licensed by the FAA. Our safety and maintenance procedures are reviewed and periodically audited by the
	aircraft manufacturer, the AAC, the FAA, IATA and, to a lesser extent, every foreign country to which we fly. Copa Airlines&#146; maintenance facility at Tocumen International Airport has been certified by the FAA as an approved repair station, and
	twice a year the FAA inspects its facilities to validate and renew the certification. Copa&#146;s aircraft are initially covered by warranties that have a term of four years, resulting in lower maintenance expenses during the period of coverage. All

	Our SMS provides operational leaders with reactive, proactive, and predictive data analyses that are delivered on a frequent and recurring
	basis. This program also uses a three-tiered meeting structure to ensure the safety risk of all identified hazards are assessed and corrective actions (if required) are implemented. At the lowest meeting level, the Operational Leaders review the
	risk assessments, assign actions, and monitor progress. At the middle meeting level, the Chief Operations Officer meets with the Operational Leaders to ensure all cross-divisional issues are properly addressed and funded. At the highest meeting
	level, the Chief Executive Officer monitors the performance of the SMS program and ensures the safety risk is being properly managed.

	conducted by properly qualified and trained internal safety professionals. Our audit program consists of three major components. The first serves as the aircraft maintenance quality assurance program and is supported by six dedicated maintenance
	professionals. The second team consists of an internal team dedicated to conducting standardized audits of airport, flight operations, and associated functions. The third component of our audit program is a biennial audit of all operational
	components by the internationally recognized standard&#151;IATA Operational Safety Audit (IOSA). We are happy to report that in 2015 both certificates (Copa Airlines&#151;Panama and Copa Airlines&#151;Colombia) successfully completed the IOSA

	Fuel costs are extremely volatile, as they are subject to many global economic, geopolitical, weather, environmental and other factors that we
	can neither control nor accurately predict. Due to its inherent volatility, aircraft fuel has historically been our most unpredictable unit cost. In the past, rapid increases in prices have come from increased demand for oil coupled with limited
	refinery capacity and instability in oil-exporting countries. Recently, prices have decreased due to the strong U.S. dollar, declining demand and rising crude oil inventories.

	From 2009 to 2015, the average price of West Texas Intermediate (&#147;WTI&#148;) crude oil, a benchmark
	widely used for crude oil prices that is measured in barrels and quoted in U.S. dollars, decreased by 20.8% from $61.7 per barrel to $48.8 per barrel. During 2015, fuel prices experienced a continuous decrease, with WTI crude prices reaching the
	price of approximately $37.4 per barrel for the month of December. In 2015, we hedged 28% of our requirements through the use of jet fuel swap and zero cost collars contracts. While prices have significantly decreased since their peak in 2008, we
	believe that fuel prices are likely to increase in the future. We have hedged approximately 33% and 6% of our anticipated fuel needs for 2016 and 2017, respectively. We will continue to evaluate various hedging strategies, and we may enter into
	additional hedging agreements in the future. Any prolonged increase in the price of jet fuel will likely materially and negatively affect our business, financial condition and results of operation. In the past, we have managed to offset some of the
	increases in fuel prices with higher load factors, fuel surcharges and fare increases. In addition, our relatively young, winglet-equipped fleet also helps us mitigate the impact of higher fuel prices.

	things, gas emissions into the atmosphere, disposal of solid waste and aqueous effluents, aircraft noise, and other activities that result from the operation of aircraft and our aircraft comply with all environmental standards applicable to their
	operations as described in this annual report. In 2010, we were recognized by GreenHorizon Aviation with the &#147;World&#146;s Most Sustainable Airline&#148; Environmental Award. In 2009, we conducted, through a consulting firm, a voluntary
	environmental audit of our hangar and support facilities at the Tocumen International Airport to determine what, if any, measures we needed to implement in order to satisfy the Panamanian General Environmental Law and regulations at those
	facilities. In 2013, the Panamanian National Environmental Authority (&#147;ANAM&#148;) approved the Environmental Management and Adequacy Program (&#147;PAMA&#148;) we submitted, which incorporates the adequacy and compliance actions to be
	implemented following the 2013 ANAM&acute;s approval, actions like a recycling program, better use of natural resources, electric energy consumption reduction plan, among many others. We currently comply with the General Environmental Law, and we
	are in the process of final adequacy of our wastewater treatment plant (PTAR) at our on-board services facilities (AAB). Once the PTAR is in compliance with all parameters required by COPANIT 35-2000 then we will apply for its operation permission
	to ANAM, and the PAMA final report will be presented to ANAM in order to get final resolution and establish its annual following-up assessments. Copa Airlines is an active signatory company of the Global Compact of the United Nations and its local
	chapter of the Global Compact Network Panama, and have, thus, published our Communication on Progress (COP) since October 2001. This Global Compact agreement required us to implement some measures like maintaining a young fleet, incorporating new
	navigation technologies such as RNAV to reduce fuel consumption, installation of winglets in our planes to reduce fuel consumption, CO2 emission compensation programs for our passengers, and recycling, among many others During 2015 we collected a
	total of 194 tons of recycling materials in Panama&acute;s COPA facilities, which represents a total approximately $23,300 in savings resulting from not sending this waste to the landfill. Our recycling programs also include the burned oil from
	vehicles and contaminated fuel drained from aircrafts. We outsourced the collection of 5,385 gallons of hydrocarbons in 2015 and its subsequent conversion into industrial boiler fuel. We also outsourced the collection of 120,212 gallons of oily
	water from aircraft cleaning operations and the subsequent treatment of 96,170 gallons which were then returned to nature.

	Antitrust Regulations.
</I>
	In 1996, the Republic of Panama enacted antitrust legislation, which regulates
	industry concentration and vertical anticompetitive practices and prohibits horizontal collusion. The Consumer Protection and Free Trade Authority is in charge of enforcement and may impose fines only after a competent court renders an adverse
	judgment. The law also provides for direct action by any affected market participant or consumer, independently or through class actions. The law does not provide for the granting of antitrust immunity, as is the case in the United States. In
	February 2006, the antitrust legislation was amended to increase the maximum fines that may be assessed for violations to $1,000,000 for violations and $250,000 for minor infractions of antitrust law. In October 2007, the antitrust legislation was
	amended again to include new regulations.

	noise-abatement provisions of ICAO, through Book XIV of the Panamanian Civil Aviation Regulations (&#147;RAC&#148;). Thus, articles 227-229 of Book XIV of the RAC require aircraft registered in Panama to comply with at least Stage 2 noise
	requirements, and all aircraft registered for the first time with the Panamanian Civil Aviation Authority after January&nbsp;1, 2003, to comply with Stage 3 noise restrictions. Currently, all the airplanes we operate or have on order meet the most

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:8%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Colombia has expanded its open-skies agreements with several countries in the last years. In addition to Aruba and the Andean Pact nations of
	Bolivia, Ecuador and Peru, open-skies agreements have been negotiated with Costa Rica, El Salvador, Panama, Dominican Republic and Ecuador. In the framework of liberalization between Colombia and Panama, any airline has the right to operate
	unlimited frequencies between any city pair of the two countries. As a result, Copa offers scheduled services between nine main cities in Colombia and Panama. In November 2010, Colombia signed an open-skies agreement with the United States, which
	took effect in January 2013. With respect to domestic aviation, airlines must present feasibility studies to secure specific route rights, and no airline may serve the city pairs with the most traffic unless that airline has at least five aircraft
	with valid airworthiness certificates. While Aeronautica Civil has historically regulated the competition on domestic routes, in December 2012 it revoked a restriction requiring a maximum number of competing airlines on each domestic route.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:8%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	In October 2011, Aeronautica Civil announced its decision to liberalize air fares in Colombia starting April&nbsp;1, 2012, including the
	elimination of fuel surcharges. However, airlines are required to charge an administrative fee (tarifa administrativa) for each ticket sold through an airline&#146;s direct channels. Passengers in Colombia are also entitled by law to compensation in
	the event of delays in excess of four hours, over-bookings and cancellations. Currently, the San Andr&eacute;s, Bogot&aacute;, Pereira, Cali, Cartagena, Medellin, Bucaramanga, C&uacute;cuta, and Santa Marta airports, among others, are under private

	Copa Airlines&#146; operations in the United States are also subject to regulation by the FAA with respect to aviation safety matters,
	including aircraft maintenance and operations, equipment, aircraft noise, ground facilities, dispatch, communications, personnel, training, weather observation, air traffic control and other matters affecting air safety. The FAA requires each
	foreign air carrier serving the United States to obtain operational specifications pursuant to 14 CFR Part 129 of its regulations and to meet operational criteria associated with operating specified equipment on approved international routes. We
	believe that we are in compliance in all material respects with all requirements necessary to maintain in good standing our operations specifications issued by the FAA. The FAA can amend, suspend, revoke or terminate those specifications, or can
	temporarily suspend or permanently revoke our authority if we fail to comply with the regulations, and can assess civil penalties for such failure. A modification, suspension or revocation of any of our DOT authorizations or FAA operating
	specifications could have a material adverse effect on our business. The FAA also conducts safety audits and has the power to impose fines and other sanctions for violations of airline safety regulations. We have not incurred any material fines
	related to operations. The FAA also conducts safety International Aviation Safety Assessment (&#147;IASA&#148;) as to Panama&#146;s compliance with International Civil Aviation Organization (&#147;ICAO&#148;) safety standards. Panama is currently
	considered a Category 1 country that complies with ICAO international safety standards. As a Category 1 country, no limitations are placed upon our operating rights to the Unites States. If the FAA should determine that Panama does not meet the ICAO

	Security
</I>
	. On
	November&nbsp;19, 2001, the U.S. Congress passed, and the President signed into law, the Aviation and Transportation Security Act (the &#147;Aviation Security Act&#148;). This law federalized substantially all aspects of civil aviation security and
	created the TSA, an agency of the Department of Homeland Security, to which the security responsibilities previously held by the FAA were transitioned. The Aviation Security Act requires, among other things, the implementation of certain security
	measures by airlines and airports, such as the requirement that all passengers, their bags and all cargo be screened for explosives and other security related contraband. Funding for airline and airport security required under the Aviation Security
	Act is provided in part by a $2.50 per segment passenger security fees for flights departing from the United States, subject to a $10 per roundtrip cap; however, airlines are responsible for costs incurred to meet security requirements beyond those
	provided by the TSA. The United States government is considering increases to this fee as the TSA&#146;s costs exceed the revenue it receives from these fees. Implementation of the requirements of the Aviation Security Act has resulted in increased
	costs for airlines and their passengers. Since the events of September&nbsp;11, 2001, the U.S. Congress has mandated and the TSA has implemented numerous security procedures and requirements that have imposed and will continue to impose burdens on
	airlines, passengers and shippers.

	Fuel cost is
	our single largest operating expense and, as a result, our results of operations are likely to continue to be materially affected by the cost of fuel as compared with prior periods. From 2009 to 2015, the average price of West Texas Intermediate
	(&#147;WTI&#148;) crude oil, a benchmark widely used for crude oil prices that is measured in barrels and quoted in U.S. dollars, decreased by 20.8% from $61.7 per barrel to $48.8 per barrel. During 2015, fuel prices experienced a continuous
	decrease, with WTI crude prices reaching the price of approximately $37.4 per barrel for the month of December. In 2015, we hedged 28% of our requirements through the use of jet fuel swap and zero cost collars contracts. While prices have
	significantly decreased since their peak in 2008, we believe that fuel prices are likely to increase in the future. We have hedged approximately 33% and 6% of our anticipated fuel needs for 2016 and 2017, respectively. We will continue to evaluate
	various hedging strategies, and we may enter into additional hedging agreements in the future. Any prolonged increase in the price of jet fuel will likely materially and negatively affect our business, financial condition and results of operation.
	In the past, we have managed to offset some of the increases in fuel prices with higher load factors, fuel surcharges and fare increases. In addition, our relatively young, winglet-equipped fleet also helps us mitigate the impact of higher fuel
	prices.

	amount that one passenger pays to fly one mile. We use a combination of approaches, taking into account yields, flight load factors and effects on load factors of connecting traffic, depending on the characteristics of the markets served, to arrive
	at a strategy for achieving the best possible revenue per available seat mile, balancing the average fare charged against the corresponding effect on our load factors.

	Generally, our revenues from and the profitability of our flights peak during the northern hemisphere&#146;s summer season in July and August

	The main components of our operating expenses are aircraft fuel, salaries and benefits, passenger servicing, commissions, aircraft maintenance,
	reservations and sales, depreciation and amortization and aircraft rent. A common measure of per unit costs in the airline industry is cost per available seat mile (&#147;CASM&#148;), which is generally defined as operating expenses divided by ASMs.

<I>
	Aircraft fuel.
</I>
	The price we pay for aircraft fuel varies significantly from country to country primarily due to local taxes. While
	we purchase aircraft fuel at all the airports to which we fly, we attempt to negotiate fueling contracts with companies that have a multinational presence in order to benefit from volume purchases. During 2015, as a result of the location of its
	hub, Copa purchased 55% of its aircraft fuel in Panama. Copa has 21 suppliers of aircraft fuel across its network. In some cases, we tanker fuel in order to minimize our cost by fueling in airports where fuel prices are lowest. Our aircraft fuel
	expenses are variable and fluctuate based on global oil prices. From 2009 to 2015, the average price of West Texas Intermediate (&#147;WTI&#148;) crude oil, a benchmark widely used for crude oil prices that is measured in barrels and quoted in U.S.
	dollars, decreased by 20.8% from $61.7 per barrel to $48.8 per barrel. While prices have significantly decreased since their peak in 2008, we believe that fuel prices are likely to increase in the future. In the past, we have managed to offset some
	of the increases in fuel prices with higher load factors, fuel surcharges and fare increases. In addition, our relatively young, winglet-equipped fleet also helps us mitigate the impact of higher fuel prices. Historically, we have not hedged a
	significant portion of our fuel costs. We have hedged 33% and 6% of our anticipated fuel needs for 2016 and 2017, respectively.

	Commissions.
</I>
	Commission expenses are driven mainly by passenger revenues, indirect channel
	penetration performance, and agreed commission rates, as opposed to ASM growth. Our commission expenses consist primarily of payments for ticket sales made by travel agents and commissions paid to credit card companies. Travel agents receive base
	commissions, not including back-end incentive programs, ranging from 0% to 6% depending on the country. During the last few years we have reduced our commission expense per available seat mile as a result of an industry-wide trend of paying lower
	commissions to travel agencies and by increasing the proportion of our sales made through direct channels. We expect this trend to continue as more of our customers become accustomed to purchasing through call centers and through the internet. While
	increasing direct sales may increase the commissions we pay to credit card companies, we expect that the savings from the corresponding reduction in travel agency commissions will more than offset this increase. In recent years, base commissions
	paid to travel agents have decreased significantly. At the same time, we have encouraged travel agencies to move from standard base commissions to incentive compensation based on sales volume and fare types.

<I>
	Maintenance, material and repair expenses.
</I>
	Our maintenance, material and repair expenses consist of aircraft repair and charges related
	to line maintenance of our aircraft, including maintenance materials, and aircraft return costs. As the age of our fleet increases and our warranties expire, our maintenance expenses will increase. We conduct line maintenance internally and
	outsource most heavy maintenance to independent third party contractors. In 2003, we negotiated with GE Engine Services a maintenance cost per hour program for the repair and maintenance of our CFM-56 engines which power our Boeing 737 Next
	Generation fleet. Our engine maintenance costs are also aided by the sea-level elevation of our hub and the use of winglets which allow us to operate the engines on our Boeing 737 Next Generation aircraft with lower thrust, thus putting less strain
	on the engines. In 2011 and 2012, we negotiated a maintenance agreement with GE Engine Services for the repair and maintenance of our CF-34 and CFM-56 engines.

	Aircraft rent.
</I>
	Our aircraft rental expenses are generally fixed by the terms of our operating lease agreements. We currently have 33
	operating leases, 28 of which are operating leases with fixed rates not subject to fluctuations in interest rates; the remaining 5 operating leases are tied to LIBOR. Our aircraft rent expense also includes rental payments related to any wet-leasing
	of freighter aircraft to supplement our cargo operations.

	Reservations and sales expenses.
</I>
	The main variable involved in driving
	reservations and sales expenses is the number of bookings made through our global distribution channels, as opposed to ASM. Our reservations and sales expenses arise primarily from payments to these global distribution systems, such as Amadeus and
	Sabre, which list our flight offerings on reservation systems around the world. These reservation systems tend to raise their rates periodically, but we expect that if we are successful in encouraging our customers to purchase tickets through our
	direct sales channels, these costs will decrease as a percentage of our operating costs. A portion of our reservations and sales expenses is also comprised of our licensing payments for the SHARES reservation and check-in management software we use,
	which is not expected to change significantly from period to period.

	The Panamanian Fiscal Code for the airline industry states that tax is based on net income earned for traffic whose origin or final
	destination is the Republic of Panama. The applicable tax rate is currently 25%. Dividends from our Panamanian subsidiaries, including Copa, are separately subject to a 10% percent withholding tax on the portion attributable to Panamanian sourced
	income and a 5% withholding tax on the portion attributable to foreign sourced income. Additionally, a 7% value added tax is levied on tickets issued in Panama for travel commencing in Panama and going abroad, irrespective of where such tickets were
	ordered.

	We are also subject to local tax regulations in each of the other jurisdictions where we operate, the great majority of which
	are related to the taxation of our income. In some of the countries to which we fly, we do not pay any income taxes because we do not generate income under the laws of those countries either because they do not have income taxes or due to treaties
	or other arrangements those countries have with Panama. In the remaining countries, we pay income tax at rates ranging from 22% to 34% of our income attributable to those countries. Different countries calculate our income in different ways, but
	they are typically derived from our sales in the applicable country multiplied by our net margin or by a presumed net margin set by the relevant tax legislation.

	The determination of our taxable income in several countries is based on a combination of
	revenues sourced to each particular country and the allocation of expenses to that particular country. The methodology for multinational transportation company sourcing of revenue and expense is not always specifically prescribed in the relevant tax
	regulations, and therefore is subject to interpretation by both ourselves and the respective tax authorities. Additionally, in some countries, the applicability of certain regulations governing non-income taxes and the determination of our filing
	status are also subject to interpretation. We cannot estimate the amount, if any, of the potential tax liabilities that might result if the allocations, interpretations and filing positions we use in preparing our income tax returns were challenged
	by the tax authorities of one or more countries. If taxes were to increase, our financial performance and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. Due to the competitive revenue environment, many increases in fees and taxes
	have been absorbed by the airline industry rather than being passed on to the passenger. Any such increases in our fees and taxes may reduce demand for air travel and thus our revenues.

	The preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with IFRS as issued by the IASB requires our management to adopt
	accounting policies and make estimates and judgments to develop amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and related notes. We strive to maintain a process to review the application of our accounting policies and to evaluate the
	appropriateness of the estimates required for the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. We believe that our estimates and judgments are reasonable; however, actual results and the timing of recognition of such amounts could differ
	from those estimates. In addition, estimates routinely require adjustments based on changing circumstances and the receipt of new or better information.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:8%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Our critical accounting policies are described below and estimates are defined as those that are reflective of significant judgments and

	Goodwill and Intangible Assets.
</I>
	&nbsp;We have allocated goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives acquired through business
	combinations for the purposes of impairment testing to two cash-generating units, one for the intangible assets and two for the goodwill.&nbsp;Goodwill is tested for impairment annually, or when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the
	carrying amount may not be recoverable, by comparing the carrying amount to the recoverable amount of the two cash-generating units that have been measured on the basis of its value-in-use, by applying cash flow projections in the functional
	currency based on the Company&#146;s approved business plan covering a five-year period followed by the a long-term growth rate.&nbsp;Considerable judgment is necessary to evaluate the impact of operating and macroeconomic changes to estimate future
	cash flows and to measure the recoverable amount.&nbsp;Assumptions in the Company&#146;s impairment evaluations are consistent with internal projections and operating plans.

	In particular, the AeroRepublica trade name and routes were acquired as part of the AeroRepublica acquisition and were capitalized at fair
	value at that date.&nbsp;When acquired the brand name and routes were considered to have an indefinite useful life (and were not amortized) due to several factors and considerations, including the brand awareness and market position, customer
	recognition and loyalty.&nbsp;The carrying values of the routes were reviewed for impairment annually or when events or changes in circumstances indicated that carrying values may not have been recoverable.&nbsp;The Company assessed at each
	statement of financial position date whether intangibles assets with indefinite useful lives were impaired using discounted cash flow analyses.&nbsp;In the third quarter of 2010, the Company changed the commercial name of AeroRepublica and began to
	operate under the brand Copa Colombia. As a result, we recognized an impairment to the value of the brand name of $1.5 million during 2010. The remaining balance of this intangible asset was amortized over five years. During 2013, we recognized
	intangible write-off charges and an impairment charge of $21.1 million and $10.1 million, respectively, as a result of the change in the operational plan for Copa Colombia in connection with shifting Copa Colombia&#146;s capacity from the domestic
	to the international market.

	Lease accounting.
</I>
	Aircraft lease agreements can be accounted as either operating or finance leases. When the risks and benefits of the
	asset under lease are transferred to us, as lessee, the lease is classified as a finance lease. Finance leases are accounted for as an acquisition obtained through a financing, with the aircraft recorded as a fixed asset and a corresponding
	liability recorded as a loan. Finance lease assets are recorded based on the lesser of the fair value of the aircraft or the present value of the minimum lease payments, discounted at an implicit interest rate, when it is clearly identified in the
	lease agreement, or our incremental borrowing rate. The aircraft is depreciated through the lesser of its useful life or the lease term. Interest expense is recognized through the effective interest rate method, based on the implicit interest rate
	of the lease. Lease agreements that do not transfer the risks and benefits to us are classified as operating leases. Operating leases are accounted as a rental, and the minimum lease expense is recognized through the straight line method.

	Our consolidated net loss in 2015 totaled $225.0 million, a 162.2% decrease from net income of $361.7 million in 2014. This decrease was
	primarily because we recognized a Venezuelan currency translation and transactional loss of $432.5 million, and due to operating revenue decreasing by 16.8%. In addition, we had consolidated operating income of $266.1 million in 2015, a 48.9%
	decrease over operating income of $521.1 million in 2014. Our consolidated operating margin in 2015 was 11.8%, a decrease of 7.4 percentage points versus 2014.

	. Passenger revenue totaled $2.2 billion in 2015, a 17.3% decrease over

</I>
	. Aircraft fuel totaled $602.8 million in 2015, a 26.6&nbsp;% decrease from aircraft fuel of $820.7 million in 2014. This
	decrease was primarily a result of 3.2% higher fuel consumption due to 3% more block hours offset by a 28.9% decrease in the all-in average fuel price per gallon of jet fuel ($2.18 in 2015 compared to $3.06 in 2014), and is net of a realized fuel

	.
	Salaries and benefits totaled $289.5 million in 2015, a 3.2% decrease over salaries and benefits of $299.2 million in 2014. This was primarily a result of decreases in variable compensation and positive effects on foreign exchange rates partly
	offset by full year effects of inflation adjustments and a 0.4% increase in headcount to support additional capacity.

</I>
	. Passenger servicing totaled $258.3 million in 2015 compared to $268.8 million in 2014. This represented a 3.9% decrease driven mainly by efficiencies related to meals, beverages and supplies, on board and airport handling at stations,
	and a positive effect due to exchange rate depreciation on non-USD denominated costs; offset by a 1.7% increase in the number of passengers transported during 2015 compared to 2014, and a 1.1% growth in departures.

<I>
	Commissions
</I>
	. Commissions totaled $88.6 million in 2015, a 10.7% decrease from commissions of $99.1 million in 2014. This decrease was
	due to a lower base of passengers in countries with high commission rates. Commissions represented 3.9% of our operating revenue in 2015 and 3.7% in 2014.

	Reservations and sales
</I>
	. Reservations and sales totaled $88.1 million in 2015, a 6.1% decrease compared to $93.8 million in 2014. This
	decrease was primarily because of lower sales taxes due to fewer sales, especially in Venezuela. Reservations and sales represented 3.9% and 3.5% of our operating revenue in 2015 and 2014.

	Maintenance, materials and repairs totaled $111.2 million in 2015, a 9.6% increase over

</I>
	. Depreciation totaled $134.9 million in 2015, a 17.1% increase over $115.1 million in 2014,
	mainly because of the full-year effect of additional aircraft and maintenance events from 2014, additional 2015 aircraft deliveries, and the accelerated depreciation of maintenance events related to leased aircraft returns scheduled for later this

</I>
	Flight operations amounted to $130.9 million in 2015, a 0.9% decrease compared to $132.2

	. Landing fees and other rentals amounted to $56.7 million in 2015, a 5.5% increase compared to $53.7

	Aircraft rentals
</I>
	. Aircraft rental expense amounted to $122.2 million in 2015, a 9.0% increase from $112.1 million reported in 2014.
	This increase is attributable to the addition of three leased Boeing 737NG aircraft in 2015 and the full-year effect of four leased aircraft in 2014. At December&nbsp;31, 2015 we had leased a total of 33 operational aircraft, comprised of both

	unrestricted cash balance. To comply with the first ratio, our EBITDA plus aircraft rent expense, or EBITDAR, for the prior year must be at least 2.0 times our fixed-charge expenses (including interest, commission, fees, discounts and other finance
	payments) for that year. To comply with the second ratio, our long-term obligations must be no more than six times EBITDAR. Third, our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investment balance should be at least $50 million. We also pay a commitment

	In February 2011, participants from the member states of the Organization for Economic
	Co-operation and Development (&#147;OECD&#148;), including the Export-Import Bank of the United States, agreed to a new common approach with respect to aircraft purchase financing (the &#147;2011 Aircraft Sector Understanding&#148;). The 2011

	loan agreement we are required to comply with certain financial covenants. The first covenant requires our EBITDAR for the prior year to be at least 2.5 times our fixed-charge expenses (including interest, commission, fees, discounts and other
	finance payments) for that year. The second covenant requires a total liability plus operating leases minus operating cash to tangible net worth ratio of less than 5.5 to 1. The third covenant requires our tangible net worth to be at least $160
	million. The last covenant requires us to maintain a minimum of $75 million in available cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments.

	Our maintenance expenses are dependent on a large number of factors, some of which can be estimated, such as aircraft usage, aircraft
	destination and overhaul events, while many others result from unforeseen events.&nbsp;In 2015, our maintenance expenses increased by 9.6%, primarily a result of an increase in repairs and materials driven by our capacity growth and fleet age. In
	2016, we estimate that our maintenance expenses will increase by 12.2%, mainly driven by an estimated 3.8% increase in flight hours and by an increase in aircraft return provisions due to the full-year effect of three new leased aircraft in 2015 and
	lease return expenses. We expect jet fuel prices will continue to be volatile in 2016 and expect to continue evaluating fuel hedging programs to help protect us against short-term movements in crude oil prices. We expect our operating capacity to
	increase approximately 2.8&nbsp;% in 2016, primarily as a result of 2015 growth full-year effect.

	In March 2007, the Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors granted, for the first time, 35,657 equity
	stock options to certain named executive officers, which vest over three years in yearly installments equal to one-third of the awarded stock on each of the three anniversaries of the grant date. The exercise price of the options is $53.14, which
	was the market price of the Company&#146;s stock at the grant date. The stock options have a contractual term of 10 years.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:8%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The
	weighted-average fair value of the stock options at the grant date was $22.3, and was estimated using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model assuming an expected dividend yield of 0.58%, expected volatility of approximately 37.8% based on historical
	volatility, weighted average risk-free interest rate of 4.59%, and an expected term of 6 years calculated under the simplified method.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:8%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The Compensation Committee plans to make additional equity-based awards under the plan from time to time, including additional non-vested
	stock and stock option awards. While the Compensation Committee will retain discretion to vary the exact terms of future awards, we anticipate that future employee non-vested stock and stock option awards granted pursuant to the plan will generally
	vest over a three-year period and the stock options will carry a ten year term.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:8%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The total compensation cost recognized for non-vested
	stock and option awards was $4.0 million, $4.7 million, $6.0 million, $7.0 million, $7.7 million and $4.0 million in 2015, 2014, 2013, 2012, and 2011, respectively, and was recorded as a component of &#147;Salaries and benefits&#148; within

	During the first quarter of 2016, the Compensation Committee of the Company&#146;s Board of Directors approved and
	granted four awards.&nbsp;Awards were granted under these plans for approximately 85,000 shares of non-vested stock, which will vest over a period of three to five years.&nbsp;The Company estimates the fair value of these awards to be approximately
	$4.9 million and the 2016 compensation cost for these plans will be $2.4 million

	Our profit-sharing program reflects our belief that our employees will remain dedicated to our success if they
	have a stake in that success. We identify key performance drivers within each employee&#146;s control as part of our annual objectives plan, or &#147;Path to Success.&#148; Typically, we pay bonuses in the first quarter of the year based on our
	performance during the preceding calendar year. For members of management, 75% of the bonus amount is based on our performance as a whole and 25% is based on the achievement of individual goals. Bonuses for non-management employees are based on the
	Company&#146;s performance and payment is typically a multiple of the employee&#146;s weekly salary. The bonus payments are approved by our compensation committee. We typically make accruals each month for the expected annual bonuses, which are
	reconciled to actual payments at their dispersal in the first quarter of the following year.

	We provide training for all of our
	employees, including technical training for our pilots, dispatchers, flight attendants and other technical staff. In addition, we provide recurrent customer service training to frontline staff, as well as leadership training for managers. We
	currently have three flight simulators at our training facility in Panama&#146;s City of Knowledge.&nbsp;In 2005, we leased a Level B flight simulator for Boeing 737-Next Generation training that served 80% of our initial training, transition and
	upgrade training, and 100% of our recurrent training needs relating to that aircraft.&nbsp;During 2007, we upgraded this simulator to provide 100% of our initial training.&nbsp;In 2008, we leased a similar flight simulator for Embraer 190 training
	that serves for all of our initial and recurrent training needs. In 2010, Copa bought a second 737-Next Generation Full Flight Simulator (FFS), Level D. The Level D qualification is the highest certification provided by the Federal Aviation
	Administration (FAA) to any Flight Training Device. Another important acquisition in 2011 was the second B737 Virtual Procedure Trainer (VPT), which complements the new FFS training. In October 2012, the lease on our first B737 NG simulator expired
	and we bought a new FFTX technology training device accompanied by a new Virtual Procedure Trainer (VPT). We plan to buy a new Boeing 737-800 Full Flight Simulator (FFS-X) compliant with regulatory Qualification Level D, and two new B737-800 Cockpit
	Procedure Trainers (CPTs) compliant with regulatory Qualification FTD Level 4 to provide 100% of our initial, recurrent, transition and upgrade training needs.

	continue to enjoy good relations with its employees and the unions in the future.

	seeks to reduce its ownership below 10% of our total share capital, our independent directors may decide to issue special voting shares solely to Panamanian nationals to maintain the ownership requirements mandated by the Panamanian Aviation Act.

	reason, amend or discontinue the dividend policy. Our Board of Directors may change the level of dividends provided for in this dividend policy or entirely discontinue the payment of dividends. Future dividends with respect to shares of our common
	stock, if any, will depend on, among other things, our results of operations, cash requirements, financial condition, contractual restrictions, business opportunities, provisions of applicable law and other factors that our Board of Directors may

	Class&nbsp;A shares will be considered readily tradable on an established securities market at a later date. Non-corporate United States Holders that do not meet a minimum holding period requirement during which they are not protected from the risk
	of loss or that elect to treat the dividend income as &#147;investment income&#148; pursuant to Section&nbsp;163(d)(4) of the Code will not be eligible for the reduced rates of taxation regardless of our status as a qualified foreign corporation. In
	addition, the rate reduction will not apply to dividends if the recipient of a dividend is obligated to make related payments with respect to positions in substantially similar or related property. This disallowance applies even if the minimum
	holding period has been met. You should consult your own tax advisors regarding the application of these rules to your particular circumstances.

	To the extent that the amount of any distribution exceeds our current and accumulated earnings and profits

	discussed below under &#147;&#151;Taxation of Capital Gains&#148;). Consequently, such distributions in excess of our current and accumulated earnings and profits would generally not give rise to foreign source income and you would generally not be

	Aircraft Fuel
</I>
	. Our results of operations are affected by changes in the price and
	availability of aircraft fuel. To manage the price risk, we use crude oil swap agreements. Market risk is estimated as a hypothetical 10% increase in the December&nbsp;31, 2015 cost per gallon of fuel. Based on projected 2015 fuel consumption, such
	an increase would result in an increase to aircraft fuel expense of approximately $30.8 million in 2016, not taking into account our derivative contracts. We have hedged approximately 33&nbsp;% and 6% of our anticipated fuel needs for 2016 and 2017,
	respectively. We may enter into additional hedging agreements in the future to reduce the volatility of our fuel expenses.

<I>
	Interest
</I>
	. Our earnings are affected by changes in interest rates due to the impact those changes have on interest expense from
	variable-rate debt instruments and operating leases and on interest income generated from our cash and investment balances. If interest rates average 10% more in 2016 than they did during 2015, our interest expense would increase by approximately
	$0.8 million and the fair value of our debt would decrease by approximately $1.7 million. If interest rates average 10% less in 2016 than they did in 2015, our interest income from marketable securities would decrease by approximately $0.8 million
	and the fair value of our debt would increase by approximately $1.7 million. These amounts are determined by considering the impact of the hypothetical interest rates on our variable-rate debt and marketable securities equivalent balances at
	December&nbsp;31, 2015.

<I>
	Foreign Currencies.
</I>
	The majority of our obligations are denominated in U.S. dollars. Since Panama uses the
	U.S. dollar as legal tender, the majority of our operating expenses are also denominated in U.S. dollars. Our foreign exchange risk is limited as approximately 67.9% of our revenues are in U.S. dollars. A significant part of our revenue is
	denominated in foreign currencies, including the Colombian peso, Argentinian peso, and Brazilian real, which represented 13.4%, 5.6% and 11.6%, respectively. Generally, our exposure to most of these foreign currencies, with the exception of the
	Venezuelan bolivar, is limited to the period of up to two weeks between the completion of a sale and the conversion to U.S. dollars. As of December&nbsp;31, 2015 after recording a $420.6 million translation loss of our cash held as long-term
	investments, we had a cash and investments balance of $13.4 million in Venezuela. &#150;See &#147;Item 3. Key Information &#150; D. Risk Factors- Our substantial cash balances in Venezuelan bolivars are subject to unfavorable exchange controls, and
	our Venezuelan operations could be adversely affected by conditions in Venezuela or by relations between Panama and Venezuela.&#148; On January&nbsp;1, 2015, given the change in its business strategy focused on international markets, Copa Colombia
	concluded that the most appropriate functional currency of the Company would be U.S. dollars.&nbsp;This reflects the fact that the majority of the airline&#146;s business is influenced by pricing in international markets, with a dollar economic
	environment.&nbsp;In the same way, the major operating expenses such as fuel, leasing, airport services and sales commissions are dollarized.&nbsp;Until December&nbsp;31, 2014, the previous functional currency of the Company was the Colombian peso.

	our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of December&nbsp;31, 2015. There are inherent limitations to the effectiveness of any system of
	disclosure controls and procedures, including the possibility of human error and the circumvention or overriding of the controls and procedures. Accordingly, even effective disclosure controls and procedures can only provide reasonable assurance of
	achieving their control objectives. Based upon our evaluation, our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective due to a material weakness related to a method of
	presentation for non-cash transaction under IFRS within the financing and investing activity sections of the statements of cash flows. Disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be
	disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the applicable rules and forms, and that it is accumulated and communicated to our

	The Management of Copa Holdings, S.A. (&#147;the Company&#148;) is responsible for establishing and maintaining effective internal control over
	financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The Company&#146;s internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance to the Company&#146;s management and board of
	directors regarding the preparation and fair presentation of published financial statements.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:8%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Because of its inherent limitations,
	internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:8%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Management assessed the effectiveness of the Company&#146;s internal control over financial reporting as of December&nbsp;31, 2015. In making
	this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control &#150; Integrated Framework (2013).

	During the preparation of our 2015 consolidated financial statements, the criteria used to determine the nature of the Japanese Operating
	Lease with Call Option (&#147;JOLCO&#148;) transactions on the level of detail for presentation purposes in our consolidated statement of cash flows was not in compliance with a non-cash transaction presentation under IFRS. Although this method of
	presentation had been considered acceptable, recently it was identified as a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting in 2015 related to this method of presentation. This matter has been corrected in our 2015 consolidated
	financial statements, and retrospectively adjusted in prior years presented for comparable purposes (Note 5 to our consolidated financial statements). The corrections related to the current and retrospective presentation in the consolidated
	statement of cash flows of non-cash transactions related to JOLCO structure as either investing or financing cash flow activities in our consolidated statement of cash flow and did not have any effect on the net increase (decrease) in cash balance
	and availability for the years ended December 31, 2015 or 2014. Furthermore, none of the other statements presented such as: statement of financial position, statement of profit or loss, statement of comprehensive (loss) income and statement of

	We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public

	Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed
	risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

	A company&#146;s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of
	financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards, as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board. A company&#146;s internal control over
	financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1)&nbsp;pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2)&nbsp;provide
	reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards, as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IFRS), and that
	receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3)&nbsp;provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized
	acquisition, use or disposition of the company&#146;s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:8%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Because of
	its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because
	of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

	A material weakness is a
	deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the company&#146;s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or

	(JOLCO) transactions in the Company&#146;s consolidated statement of cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 was not in compliance with a non-cash transaction presentation under IFRS.

	comprehensive (loss) income, changes in equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December&nbsp;31, 2015. This material weakness was considered in determining the nature, timing and extent of audit tests applied in our

	We have audited the accompanying consolidated statements of financial position of Copa Holdings, S.A. and subsidiaries as of December&nbsp;31, 2015 and 2014,
	and the related consolidated statements of profit or loss, comprehensive (loss) income, changes in equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December&nbsp;31, 2015. These consolidated financial statements are the
	responsibility of the Company&#146;s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we
	plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
	statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for
	our opinion.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of
	Copa Holdings, S.A. and subsidiaries at December&nbsp;31, 2015 and 2014, and the consolidated results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December&nbsp;31, 2015, in conformity with International
	Financial Reporting Standards, as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	As Discussed in Note 5 to the consolidated financial statement,
	the 2014 financial statement have been restated to correct the presentation in the consolidated statement of cash flow.

	We also have audited, in

	Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission &#147;(2013 framework)&#148; and our report dated May 2, 2016 expressed an adverse opinion thereon.

	On January&nbsp;1, 2015, given the change in its business strategy focused
	on international markets, Copa Colombia concluded that the most appropriate functional currency of the Company is US dollars. This reflects the fact that the majority of the airlines business is influenced by pricing in international markets, with a
	dollar economic environment. In the same way, the major operating expenses as fuel, leasing, airport services and sales commissions are dollarized. Until December&nbsp;31, 2014, the previous functional currency of the Company was the Colombian

	Revenue is recognized to the

	Passenger revenue is recognized when transportation is provided rather than when a ticket is sold. The amount of passenger ticket sales, not

	On July&nbsp;1, 2015, the Company launched its frequent flyer program, whose objective is to reward customer loyalty through
	the earning of miles whenever the programs holders make certain flights.&nbsp;The miles or points earned can be exchanged for flights on Copa or any of other Star Alliance partners&#146; airlines.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; MARGIN-LEFT:8%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	When a passenger elects to receive frequent flyer miles in connection with a flight, the Company recognizes a portion of the ticket sales as
	revenue when the air transportation is provided and recognizes a deferred liability (Frequent flyer deferred revenue) for a portion of the ticket sale representing the value of the related miles as a multiple-deliverable revenue arrangement, in
	accordance with IFRIC 13: Customer loyalty programs.&nbsp;The deferred liability is classified as a current liability on the consolidated statement of financial position since the company does not have enough history to identify passenger&#146;
	behavior for redemptions in the short or mid-term. To determine the amount of revenue to be deferred, the Company estimates and allocate the fair value of the miles that were essentially sold along with the airfare, using a blended calculation which
	includes partner&acute;s rate and the average value of a mile to the customer.

	Furthermore, the Company estimates miles earned by members
	which will not be redeemed for an award before they expire (breakage).&nbsp;A statistical model that estimates the percentage of points that will not be redeemed before expiration is utilized to estimate breakage.&nbsp;The breakage is updated
	annually&nbsp;.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; MARGIN-LEFT:8%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	In addition, the Company sells miles to non-airline businesses with which it has marketing agreements.&nbsp;In 2015, the
	main contracts to sell miles relate to co-branded credit card relationships with two major Banks in the region. The Company determined the selling prices of miles according to a negotiated rate.

	The Company assesses at each reporting date whether there is an indication that an asset or its cash - generating unit (CGU) may be impaired.
	If any such indication exists, or when annual impairment testing for an asset is required, the Company estimates the asset&acute;s or CGU&acute;s recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of an asset&#146;s or its cash-generating
	unit&#146;s fair value less costs to sell and its value in use. Recoverable amount is determined for an individual asset, unless the asset does not generate cash inflows that are largely independent of those from other assets or group of assets.
	When the carrying amount of an asset or CGU exceeds its recoverable amount, the asset is considered impaired and is written down to its recoverable amount.

	Intangible assets with finite lives are amortized over their useful economic life and assessed for impairment whenever there is an indication

	expected pattern of consumption of future economic benefits embodied in the asset are considered to modify the amortization period or method, as appropriate, and are treated as changes in accounting estimates. The amortization expense on intangible
	assets with finite lives is recognized in the consolidated statement of profit or loss as the expense category that is consistent with the function of the intangible assets.

	Impairment exists when the carrying value of an asset or cash generating
	unit (CGU) exceeds its recoverable amount, which is the higher of its fair value less costs to sell and its value in use. The fair value less costs to sell calculation is based on available data from binding sales transactions, conducted at
	arm&#146;s length, for similar assets or observable market prices less incremental costs for disposing of the asset. The value in use calculation is based on a discounted cash flow model. The cash flows are derived from the budget for the next five
	years and do not include restructuring activities that the Company is not yet committed to or significant future investments that will enhance the asset&#146;s performance of the CGU being tested. The recoverable amount is most sensitive to the
	discount rate used for the discounted cash flow model as well as the expected future cash-inflows and the growth rate used for extrapolation purposes. See Note 15.

	During 2015, the Company adjusted the presentation of
	its statement of cash flows to more accurately reflect its transactions involving its aircraft acquisitions that were financed through Japanese Operating Leases with Call Options (JOLCO). The change consists in not reflecting its JOLCO transactions
	as cash transactions within the investing activities and financing activities sections of its consolidated statement of cash flows. The Company applied these changes retroactively to its consolidated statements of cash flows for the year ended
	December 31, 2014 in order to present its cash flows on a consistent basis. This change in presentation does not materially alter any of the company&#146;s financial information except for the statement of cash flows as summarized below.

	During 2015, the Company used Sistema Complementario de Administracion de divisas (&#147;SICAD&#148;) rate of Bs13.50 per U.S.
	dollar. At December&nbsp;31, 2015, the Company decided that in view of the lack of repatriation the SICAD rate could no longer be considered available in practice, this combined with the deterioration of the Venezuelan economy. Instead, the Company
	has chosen to use Sistema Marginal de Divisas (&#147;SIMADI&#148;) exchange rate of Bs198.7 per U.S. dollar to translate all the financial assets and liabilities at the end of the period 2015, which is considered a better reflection of the Bolivar
	given the current economic reality of that country.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	This rate has been applied to all funds in Venezuela, resulting in a foreign translation loss of
	$430.2 million at December&nbsp;31, 2015. The cash balance in Venezuela at December&nbsp;31, 2015 is $13.4 million. See Note 28 for discussion of remittance received subsequent to the date of the balance sheet date.

	Aero Republica began to operate

	recognized for $1.5 million during 2010.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	As at December&nbsp;31, 2014, routes were fully amortized. As at December&nbsp;31, 2013, fair value of the
	routes was below the carrying amount, indicating impairment of the intangible asset to domestic routes. Changes to the operating plan for Copa Colombia had affected this asset; the strategy consisted of shifting Copa Colombia&#146;s capacity from
	domestic to international markets. The impairment amount was recognized in the statement of profit or loss in the depreciation, amortization and impairment caption.

	The recoverable amount of the CGU as at December&nbsp;31, 2013 was determined based on the multi-period excess earnings method under the Income Approach. The
	multi-period excess earnings method reflects the present value of the cash flow generated by existing routes after taking into account the cost to realize the revenue and appropriate discount rate to reflect the time value and risk associated with
	the projected performance of the intangible asset. The cash flow generated was updated to reflect the changes to the operating plan of Copa Colombia. It was concluded that the carrying value of the routes was greater than the fair value. As a result
	of this analysis, management has recognized a write off for discontinued routes and an impairment charge for remaining routes of $21.1 million and $10.1 million respectively, which in aggregate represent the total amount of the intangible asset.

	Discount rates &#150; The selected rate was 10.5%, based on the Company&#146;s Weighted Average Cost of Capital (&#147;WACC&#148;). In determining the discount rate for the routes, in addition to the WACC, it is
	considered two other factors in selecting the discount rate: 1) the nature of the asset; and 2) the overall composition of the CGU asset. The selected discount rate reflects the amount of risk associated with the hypothetical future cash flow
	generated by the routes. The routes are an integral part of the overall business and therefore, the Company considered the routes to have the same inherent risk as the overall business.

	At December&nbsp;31, 2015, long term fixed rate debt included $437.6 million ($173.1 million at December&nbsp;31, 2014)

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	As of December&nbsp;31, 2015 and 2014, the Company had $525.2 million and $616.7 million of outstanding
	indebtedness, respectively, that is owed to financial institutions under financing arrangements guaranteed by the Export-Import Bank of the United States. The Export-Import Bank guarantees support 80% of the net purchase price of the aircraft and
	are secured with a first priority mortgage on the aircraft in favor of a security trustee on behalf of Export-Import Bank.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The Company&#146;s
	Export-Import Bank supported financings are amortized on a quarterly basis, are denominated in U.S. Dollars and originally bear interest at a floating rate linked to LIBOR. The Export-Import Bank guaranteed facilities typically offer an option to
	fix the applicable interest rate. The Company has exercised this option with respect to $344.9 million as of December&nbsp;31, 2015 ($416.8 million as of December&nbsp;31, 2014).
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The Company effectively extends the maturity of its aircraft financing to 15 years through the use of a &#147;Stretched Overall Amortization and
	Repayment,&#148; or SOAR, structure which provides serial draw-downs, calculated to result in a 100% loan accreting to a recourse balloon at the maturity of the Export-Import Bank guaranteed loan which totaled $36.2 million as of December&nbsp;31,
	2015 ($60.9 million as of December&nbsp;31, 2014).

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	At December&nbsp;31, 2015, the loan payable of $100 million ($30 million at December&nbsp;31, 2014)
	resulted of the use of the line of credit with Bladex, with floating rate. See Note 26 for information regardings financial covenants related to the Company&#146;s financial agreement.

	In March 2007, Copa Holdings granted 35,657 equity stock options to certain named executive officers, which vested over three (3)&nbsp;years in yearly
	installments equal to one-third of the awarded stock on each of the three anniversaries of the grant date. The exercise price of the options is $53.1, which was the market price of the Company&#146;s stock at the grant date. The stock options have a
	contractual term of 10 years.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The weighted-average fair value of the stock options at the grant date was $22.3, and was estimated using the Black-Scholes
	option-pricing model assuming an expected dividend yield of 0.58%, expected volatility of approximately 37.8% based on historical volatility, weighted average risk-free interest rate of 4.59%, and an expected term of 6 years calculated under the
	simplified method.

	As a result of the
	various aircraft financing contracts entered into by the Company, the Company is required to comply with certain financial covenants. These covenants, among other things, require the Company to maintain an earnings before income taxes, depreciation,
	amortization, and restructuring or rent cost (&#147;EBITDAR&#148;) to fixed charge ratio of at least 2.5 times, a minimum tangible net worth of $160&nbsp;million, an EBITDAR to finance charge expense ratio of at least 2.0 times, a net borrowings to
	Company&#146;s capitalization ratio of less than 85%, a total liability plus operating leases minus operating cash to tangible net worth ratio of less than 5.5, a long-term obligations to EBITDAR ratio of less than 6.0, a minimum unrestricted cash
	balance of $50&nbsp;million and a minimum of $75&nbsp;million in available cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. The Company did not comply with EBITDAR to fixed charge covenant for the year ended December 31, 2015. However, this event
	of non-compliance did not constitute an automatic event of default under our debt agreements.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The Company received technical waiver in early 2016 from
	each of the lenders under the senior term loan facility relating to the EBITDAR to fixed charges covenant. These waivers permit to the Company disregard the Venezuela foreign currency translation loss in calculating the EBITDAR to fixed charges
	ratio for 2015 and 2016. After giving effect to these waivers, the Company complied with all required covenants as of December&nbsp;31, 2015.

	Approximately 60% of the Company&#146;s
	9,302 employees are unionized. There are currently nine (9)&nbsp;union organizations; five (5)&nbsp;covering employees in Panama and four (4)&nbsp;covering employees in Colombia. The Company traditionally had good relations with its employees and
	all the unions, and expects to continue to enjoy good relations with its employees and the unions in the future.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The five (5)&nbsp;unions covering
	employees in Panama include: the pilots&#146; union (UNPAC); the flight attendants&#146; union (SIPANAB); the mechanics&#146; union (SITECMAP); the passenger service agents&#146; union (UGETRACO) and an industry union (SIELAS), which represents
	ground personnel, messengers, drivers, passenger service agents, counter agents and other non-executive administrative staff.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Copa entered into
	collective bargaining agreements with the pilot union in August 2012; the generalized union in December 2013, the mechanics&#146; union in February 2014 and most recently, Copa re-negotiated the collective bargaining with the flight attendants&#146;
	union in September 2014.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Collective bargaining agreements in Panama typically have terms of four years.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The four (4)&nbsp;unions covering employees in Colombia are: Pilots&#146; union (ACDAC), whose bill of petitions has been resolved by arbitration on
	May&nbsp;6, 2014, although the union presented an annulment against this decision. The Supreme Court decided on January&nbsp;22, 2015 to reject this legal recourse, letting the arbitration award in firm and valid until December, 2015. Given that the
	benefits have been applied since May, 2014 to all pilots, no further actions related to this decision are required. Flight attendants&#146; union (ACAV), whose bill of petitions has been resolved by arbitration on July&nbsp;15, 2014, rejected the
	arbitration decision presenting an annulment, so the process was leading to the Supreme Court. As of December&nbsp;31, 2015, the Supreme Court has not issued a resolution of this case.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The industry union in Colombia (SINTRATAC) and the Mechanics Union in Colombia (ACMA), whose bill of petitions has been resolved by arbitration on
	November&nbsp;29, 2014, although we are holding for the decision for the arbitration tribunal regarding the annulment presented by the Company in December 2014.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Typically, collective bargaining agreements in Colombia have terms of two to three years. Although Copa Colombia usually settles many of its collective
	bargaining agreement negotiations through arbitration proceedings, it has traditionally experienced good relations with its unions.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Additional to Unions
	in Panama and Colombia, the Company&#146;s employees in Brazil are covered by industry union agreements that cover all airline industry employees in the country, employees in Uruguay are covered by an industry union, airport employees in Argentina
	are affiliated to an industry union (UPADEP). Passenger services operations in Puerto Rico and Chile had been outsourced. Hence, the unions that operated in these two countries are no longer active, which minimizes the risk for the company.

	, or ATAERO), which is a 50% surcharge imposed on all airlines which fly to Brazil. Similar suits have been filed against INFRAERO by other major airline carriers. In its case, the court of first instance ruled in favor of
	INFRAERO and the Company has appealed the judgment. During the pendency of the litigation, the Company continues to pay the amounts of ATAERO due into an escrow account and as of December&nbsp;31, 2015, the aggregate amount in such account totaled
	$10.4 million ($14 million in 2014). In the event the Company receives a final unfavorable judgment, it will be required to release the escrowed fund to INFRAERO and will not be able to recover such amounts. The Company does not, however, expect the
	release of such amounts to have a material impact on its financial results.

	Financial derivative instruments expose the Company to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the

	stable and well-versed in the matters of energy risk management. The amount of such credit exposure is generally the unrealized gain, if any, in such contracts.

	Fuel price risk is estimated as a hypothetical 10% increase in the December&nbsp;31, 2015 cost per gallon of fuel. Based on projected 2016 fuel consumption,

	are in U.S. dollars (40.2% and 47.5% in 2014, respectively). A significant part of our revenue is denominated in foreign currencies, including the Colombian peso, Brazilian real, Argentinian peso and Mexican peso, which represented 13.4%, 11.6%,

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The Company, to mitigate the credit risk arising from deposit in banks and investments in financial instruments, only conducts business with financial
	institution that have investment grade of Fitch and Standard&nbsp;&amp; Poor above BBB- with strength and liquidity indicators aligning with or above the market average. Also, for the credit risk originated for commercial accounts receivables, the
	Company does not consider it is a significant one, since most of the accounts receivables can be easily converted into cash, usually in periods no longer than one month. Accounts receivables from cargo agencies are more likely to be exposed to
	credit risk, but this is mitigated with the established policies to make sure that the credit sales are to clients with good credit history. Specific credit limits and payment terms have been established according to periodic analysis of the payment
	capacity of the clients.

	policies and procedures established and followed up by the Company.

	The income and operating cash flow of the
	Company are substantially independent of changes in interest rates, because the Company does not have significant assets that generate interest except for surplus cash and cash equivalents and short and long-term investments.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The interest rate risk is originated mainly for long term debts related with aircraft acquisition. These long term lease payments at variable interest rates
	expose the Company to cash flow risk. To mitigate the effect of variable cash flows associated to contracted rates and transform them into fixed rates, the Company had entered into one Interest Rates Swap contract to hedge against market rates
	fluctuations
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The interest rate swap hedge derivative (notional amount $42.9 million) matured in August of 2015. The fair value of the interest rate swap
	hedge derivative contract was $1,206 at December&nbsp;31, 2014 and was recorded as a component of &#147;Other current liabilities&#148; against the &#147;Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)&#148;. During the hedging periods there was no
	ineffectiveness of the contract (see Note 18).
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	At December&nbsp;31, 2015 and 2014, the fixed interest rates vary from 1.81% to 5.58% and the main
	floating rate is LIBOR. Gains and losses recognized in the other comprehensive income in equity on interest rate swap contract as were continuously released to the consolidated statement of profit or loss until the repayment of the debt.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The Company earnings are affected by changes in interest rates due to the impact those changes have on interest expense from variable-rate debt instruments
	and operating leases and on interest income generated from the cash and investment balances. If interest rates average is 10% more in 2016 than they were during 2015, the interest expense would increase by approximately $0.8 million and the fair
	value of the debt would decrease by approximately $1.7 million. If interest rates average 10% less in 2016 than they were in 2015, the interest income from marketable securities would decrease by approximately $0.8 million and the fair value of the
	debt would increase by approximately $1.7 million. These amounts are determined by considering the impact of the hypothetical interest rates on the variable-rate debt and marketable securities equivalent balances at December&nbsp;31, 2015.
