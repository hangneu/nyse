PRESENTATION OF INFORMATION
</SPAN>
</P>
<P>
For the purposes of this report, and unless specified otherwise, the term
'Company' means The Royal Bank of Scotland Group plc, 'Group' or 'RBSG' means
the Company and its subsidiary undertakings, 'RBS plc' means The Royal Bank of
Scotland plc, 'RBS' means RBS plc and its subsidiary undertakings, 'NWB Plc'
means National Westminster Bank Plc and 'NatWest' means NWB Plc and its
subsidiary undertakings.
</P>
<P>
The acquisition of NatWest on 6 March 2000 had a significant effect on the
Group's financial position. In order to provide additional meaningful and
relevant comparisons, the results for the year ended 31 December 2001 are
compared with prior period results on both a statutory and a pro forma basis.
</P>
<P>
Statutory basis
</P>
<P>
Information or discussions on a statutory basis refer to the comparison of the
results for the year ended 31 December 2001 with the statutory results for the
year ended 31 December 2000 (which includes NatWest from 6 March 2000) and the
year ended 30 September 1999.
</P>
<P>
Pro forma basis
</P>
<P>
Information or discussions on a pro forma basis refer to the comparison of the
results for the year ended 31 December 2001, adjusted for the presentation of
goodwill amortisation and integration costs, with the pro forma results for the
years ended 31 December 2000 and 31 December 1999, which assume that the
acquisition of NatWest took place on 1 January 1999.
</P>
<P>
The Company publishes its financial statements in pounds sterling (&quot;(pound)&quot; or
&quot;sterling&quot;). The abbreviations '(pound)m' and '(pound)bn' represent millions
and thousands of millions of pounds sterling, respectively, and references to
'pence' represent pence in the United Kingdom (&quot;UK&quot;). Reference to 'dollars' or
'$' are to United States of America (&quot;US&quot;) dollars. The abbreviations '$m' and
'$bn' represent millions and thousands of millions of dollars, respectively, and
references to 'cents' represent cents in the US. The abbreviation '(euro)'
represents 'euro', the European single currency. Unless otherwise stated,
amounts in dollars have been translated for convenience from sterling at the
Noon Buying Rate on 31 December 2001 as shown under 'Exchange rates' on page
<BR>
10. This rate should not be construed as a representation that the sterling
amounts actually denote such dollar amounts or have been, could have been, or
could be converted into dollars at the rate indicated.
</P>
<P>
Certain information in this report is presented separately for domestic and
foreign activities. Domestic activities primarily consist of UK domestic
transactions of the Group. Foreign activities comprise the Group's
transactions conducted through those offices in the UK specifically organised
to service international banking transactions and transactions conducted
through offices outside the UK.
</P>
<P>
The geographic analysis in the table of changes in net interest income, the
average balance sheet and interest rates and average interest rates, yields,
spreads and margins in this report have been compiled on the basis of UK and
Overseas. Management believe that presentation on this basis provides more
useful information on the yields, spreads and margins of the Group's activities
than would be provided by presentation on the basis of the domestic and foreign
activities analysis used elsewhere in this report as it more closely reflects
the basis on which the Group is managed. 'UK' in this context includes domestic
transactions and transactions conducted through the offices in the UK which
service international banking transactions.
</P>
<P>
The Group distinguishes its trading from non-trading activities by determining
whether a certain business unit's principal activity is trading or non-trading
and then attributing all of that unit's activities to one portfolio or the
other. Although this method may result in some non-trading activity being
classified as trading, and vice versa, the Group believes that any resulting
misclassification is not material.
</P>
<P>
In this report, the terms 'UK GAAP' and 'US GAAP' refer to generally accepted
accounting principles (&quot;GAAP&quot;) in the UK and the US respectively.

Forward-looking statements
</P>
<P>
Certain statements in this document may be considered to be 'forward-looking
statements' as that term is defined in the United States Private Securities
Litigation Reform Act of 1995, such as statements that include the words
'expect', 'estimate', 'project', 'anticipate', 'should', 'intend', 'plan',
'probability', 'risk', 'Value-at-Risk' ('VaR'), 'target', 'goal', 'objective',
'will', 'endeavour' and similar expressions or variations on such expressions.
In particular, this document includes forward-looking statements relating, but
not limited, to the Group's potential exposures to various types of market
risks, such as interest rate risk, foreign exchange rate risk and commodity and
equity price risk. See 'Market risk', 'Value-at-Risk', and 'Liquidity risk'
elsewhere in this document. Such statements are subject to certain risks and
uncertainties. For example, certain of the market risk disclosures are
dependent on choices about key model characteristics and assumptions and are
subject to various limitations. See 'Market risk' and 'Value-at-Risk'. By their
nature, certain of the market risk disclosures are only estimates and could be
materially different from what actually occurs in the future. As a result,
actual future gains and losses could differ materially from those that have
been estimated. Other factors that could cause actual results to differ
materially from those estimated by the forward-looking statements contained in
this document include, but are not limited to: general economic conditions in
the UK and in other countries in which the Group has significant business
activities or investments, including the United States; the monetary and
interest rate policies of the Bank of England, the Board of Governors of the
Federal Reserve System and other G-7 central banks; inflation; deflation;
unanticipated turbulence in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates,
commodity prices and equity prices; changes in UK and foreign laws, regulations
and taxes; changes in competition and pricing environments; natural disasters;
the inability to hedge certain risks economically; the adequacy of loss
reserves; acquisitions or restructurings; technological changes; changes in
consumer spending and saving habits; and the success of the Group in managing
the risks involved in the foregoing.
</P>
<P>
The forward-looking statements contained in this document speak only as of the
date of this report, and the Group does not undertake to update any
forward-looking statement to reflect events or circumstances after the date
hereof or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events.

merger of National Provincial Bank Limited and Westminster Bank Limited, which
had themselves been formed through a series of mergers involving banks with
origins dating back to the 17th century. At 31 December 2001, NatWest had 2,133
branches, representative and similar offices worldwide, of which approximately
2,000, principally branch offices, were located in the UK.

The Centre
</SPAN>
</P>
<P>
The Centre comprises group and corporate functions which provide services to
the operating divisions.Accounting developments
</P>
<P>
Disclosures required by Financial Reporting Standard (&quot;FRS&quot;) 17 'Retirement
Benefits' are included in Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Further disclosures under the transitional requirements of this standard will
be made in the Group's financial statements for 2002, and full implementation
is required from 2003.
</P>
<P>
Implementation of FRS 18 'Accounting Policies' has not resulted in any changes
to the Group's principal accounting policies.
</P>
<P>
In December 2000, the Accounting Standards Board issued FRS 19 'Deferred Tax',
which will be effective for the Group's 2002 financial statements. This standard
replaces Statement of Standard Accounting Practice 15 'Accounting for deferred
tax' and requires recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities on all
timing differences, with specified exceptions. Full provision is to be made for
deferred tax liabilities, and deferred tax assets are to be recognised to the
extent that it is more likely than not that they will be recovered. Discounting
of deferred tax is permitted but not required. The Group is reviewing the
requirements of the FRS to determine its effect on the Group's financial
statements.
</P>
<P>
In February 2002, the Urgent Issues Task Force (&quot;UITF&quot;) issued UITF Abstract 33
'Obligations in capital instruments'. This Abstract sets out guidance on the
classification of capital instruments between liabilities and shareholders'
funds and is effective for the Group's 2002 accounts On implementation of this
Abstract, the Group's US$ Perpetual Regulatory tier One securities (&quot;PROs&quot;)
will be reclassified as liabilities and the interest on them reclassified as
interest payable.
</P>
<P>
<SPAN STYLE="font-weight: bold">
Competition
</SPAN>
</P>
<P>
In the UK, RBS and NatWest's principal competitors are other clearing banks,
building societies (which are similar to savings and loans associations in the
US) and the other major international banks represented in London.
</P>
<P>
Competition to serve corporate and institutional customers in the UK remains
strong. In addition to the UK clearing bank groups, large US and European
financial institutions are also active, and offer combined investment and
commercial banking capabilities. The capital markets continue to innovate and
provide a broad range of financing and risk management solutions for corporate
customers. In asset finance, Lombard competes with both banks and specialised
asset finance providers.
</P>
<P>
In the small business banking market, the Group competes with other UK clearing
bank groups, with specialist finance providers and building societies. During
2001, competition within small business banking intensified, with new services
launched by converted building societies.
</P>
<P>
In the personal banking market, competition continues to intensify. In addition
to UK banks and building societies, major retailers, life assurance companies
and internet-only service providers have entered the market. NatWest Life and
Royal Scottish Assurance compete with Independent Financial Advisors and life
assurance companies.
</P>
<P>
The UK credit card market is highly competitive, and new entrants, both UK and
international, continue to join the large number of existing card issuers.
Major retailers, utilities and specialist card issuers are active in the market
in addition to UK banks and building societies. Competition is across a range
of dimensions, including aggressive pricing, loyalty and reward schemes, and
packaged benefits.
</P>
<P>
In Wealth Management, The Royal Bank of Scotland International and NatWest
Offshore compete with other UK and international banks to offer offshore
banking services. Coutts Group and Adam &amp; Company compete as private banks with
UK clearing and private banks, and with international private banks. There has
been an increased focus by a number of competitors, both UK and international,
on the 'mass-affluent' segment of customers.
</P>
<P>
Direct Line competes in personal insurance. The market is highly competitive,
particularly the automobile segment. Direct Line faces competition from a range
of insurance companies who now operate telephone and internet direct sales
businesses. Direct Line also competes with local insurance companies in the
direct motor insurance markets in Spain, Italy, Germany and Japan.
</P>
<P>
In Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, Ulster Bank competes in retail
and commercial banking with the major Irish banks and building societies, and
with other UK and international banks and building societies active in the
market. Competition is intensifying as both UK and Irish institutions seek to
expand their businesses.

<HR CLASS="eolPageBreak">
<DIV CLASS="eolNewPage"></DIV>
<A NAME="eolPage14"></A>
<P>
In the United States, Citizens, through its banking subsidiaries, competes
primarily in New England, and from December 2001, in Pennsylvania, in retail
and mid-corporate banking markets with local and regional banks and other
financial institutions. The Royal Bank of Scotland Group also competes in the
US through Greenwich Capital Markets Inc. and branches of RBS and NatWest, in
large corporate lending and specialised finance markets, and in fixed-income
trading and sales. Competition is principally with the large US commercial and
investment banks and international banks active in the US.
</P>
<P>
In other international markets, principally in continental Europe, the Group
faces competition from the leading domestic and international institutions
active in the relevant national markets.
</P>
<P>
Monetary policy
</P>
<P>
The Group's earnings are affected by general economic conditions, both domestic
and global. The policies of the UK government, and of governments in other
countries in which the Group operates, also have an impact.
</P>
<P>
The UK government sets an inflation target, which the Chancellor of the
Exchequer confirmed in the March 2001 Budget would remain at 2.5%. The Bank of
England has operational independence in setting short-term interest rates to
achieve this target. The Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee (&quot;MPC&quot;)
meets each month to agree any change to interest rates, and the minutes of these
meetings are published two weeks later. The Bank of England was given
independence by the Chancellor of the Exchequer in 1997, with the intention of
making monetary policy free from political influence, and therefore more stable
and credible. In response to the downturn in the global economy and the
terrorist attacks on the US on 11 September 2001, the Bank of England, along
with other major central banks around the world, has cut interest rates sharply
in the past year.
</P>
<P>
The value of sterling is also important for UK monetary conditions. The monetary
authorities do not have an exchange rate target, but concerns over the strength
of sterling have played a role in the MPC monthly debates during the past year.
Sterling has been weaker against the US dollar during 2001, which has retained
its 'safe haven' status despite the US recession and the 11 September attacks.
Sterling has remained strong against the euro. While risks of sterling and
dollar depreciation remain, we anticipate only limited movements in exchange
rates are anticipated during 2002 and 2003, with a gradual depreciation of
sterling against the euro and a marginal pick up against the US dollar.
</P>
<P>
European Economic and Monetary Union (&quot;EMU&quot;)
</P>
<P>
The new European single currency, the euro, came into being on 1 January 1999.
The third stage of EMU started on schedule on 1 January 1999. During the course
of 1998, it was determined that eleven countries (Austria, Belgium, Finland,
France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Portugal and
Spain) would participate. The UK, along with Denmark, exercised its right to
opt out at that stage, and Sweden also determined not to be part of this first
wave. Initially, Greece was deemed not to qualify in terms of the criteria set
out in the Maastricht Treaty.
</P>
<P>
On 31 December 1998, the European Currency Unit (the &quot;ECU&quot;) was replaced by the
euro on the international currency markets, on a one-for-one basis. The rates
for the euro against other international currencies were based upon the
official closing rates for the ECU. The bilateral rates for the legacy
currencies of the participating states were derived from their rates within the
Exchange Rate Mechanism and the closing value of the ECU. These rates, between
the legacy currencies and between these currencies and the euro, were fixed as
of 1 January 1999. The euro became the formal currency for all eleven then
participating states.
</P>
<P>
It was subsequently determined that Greece met the criteria set out in the
Maastricht Treaty, and Greece was admitted to the third stage of EMU as from 1
January 2001. The drachma was fixed to the euro at that date. A referendum on
EMU participation was held in Denmark in 2000, with a majority voting against
entry.
</P>
<P>
Euro notes and coins were introduced into circulation in all twelve
participating states on 1 January 2002 and it is formally required under the
Maastricht Treaty that legacy currency notes and coins be withdrawn by 30 June
2002. In practice, all participating states determined that the end of legal
tender status for legacy currency notes and coins be achieved by the end of
February 2002, with three states - the Netherlands, Ireland and France -
choosing earlier dates.
</P>
<P>
Also on 1 January 1999, the European Central Bank (&quot;ECB&quot;) assumed
responsibility for the operation of monetary policy throughout the euro zone.
The ECB sets one short-term interest rate to cover all twelve countries.
</P>
<P>
The UK Government continues to indicate that they support EMU entry in
principle, but that the UK will not adopt the single currency until this is
seen as being in the UK's economic interests and also not until there has been
a positive vote at a referendum. The Chancellor of the Exchequer has laid down
five key economic conditions for UK participation and the Prime Minister has
indicated that an assessment of these five tests will be undertaken within two

The Group continues to co-operate with the UK Government, and to work
proactively within the financial sector, to develop thinking and plans
regarding a range of practical issues that would arise if the UK were to
determine to enter EMU. In particular, the Group is involved in discussions as
to how a phased transition could be achieved, to minimise cost and risk. In
addition, due attention is being paid to the implications, for elements of the
Group and for customers, of the introduction of euro notes and coins and the
withdrawal of legacy currencies.

Supervision and regulation
</P>
<P>
Recent changes to the regulation and supervision of financial services in the UK
</P>
<P>
Prior to 1 December 2001, in the UK, banks were regulated under the Banking Act
1987, insurance businesses were regulated under the Insurance Companies Act
1982 and investment businesses were subject to the Financial Services Act 1986
(&quot;FSA 1986&quot;).
</P>
<P>
In 1997, the Government decided that the regulation of banking, insurance and
financial services businesses should be brought together under the Financial
Services Authority (&quot;FSA&quot;), which would assume the role of sole statutory
regulator for the UK financial services industry.
</P>
<P>
A new statutory regime, under which the FSA took over the responsibilities and
powers of the previous UK financial services regulators, was created with the
implementation of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (the &quot;FSMA 2000&quot;)
on 30 November 2001. The FSMA 2000 replaced the majority of the existing UK
financial services legislation (including the FSA 1986, the Insurance Companies
Act 1982 and the Banking Act 1987) and it also contains legislation relating to
building societies and friendly societies. The FSMA 2000 essentially
consolidates but also harmonises and amends the previous legislation, in
various respects. It is a framework piece of legislation, underpinned by
approximately 95 pieces of secondary legislation.
</P>
<P>
Aspects of the current UK regulatory regime
</P>
<P>
The FSA has certain indirect control over the holding companies of authorised
institutions as it has statutory powers to object to persons who are, or who
intend to become, 'controllers' or 'indirect controllers' of an authorised
institution.
</P>
<P>
In the context of attaining its statutory objectives, the FSA is empowered to
request information from, and to impose requirements on, authorised
institutions.
</P>
<P>
Reports by skilled persons
</P>
<P>
The FSMA 2000 also empowers the FSA to require independent reports prepared by
accountants, lawyers, actuaries or other persons with relevant professional
skills to be provided by authorised institutions, relating to issues such as
the accuracy of accounting records and prudential returns and the adequacy of
internal controls. The appointment of a skilled person to produce a report
under the FSMA 2000 is one of the FSA's regulatory tools and can be used by the
FSA for diagnostic and monitoring purposes, in the context of preventative
action and for carrying out remedial action.
</P>
<P>
Compensation arrangements
</P>
<P>
The requirements of the EU Directives on compensation arrangements have been
brought forward under the FSMA 2000, which established a new single Financial
Services Compensation Scheme (the &quot;Scheme&quot;) replacing the eight existing
arrangements providing compensation if a firm went out of business owing money
to investors, depositors or policyholders.
</P>
<P>
The deposits of all banks incorporated in the UK including their branches in
the European Economic Area are covered by the Scheme. Most types of deposit are
covered, including current, deposit and savings accounts. Under the Scheme,
payments are generally limited to 100% of the first (pound)2,000 of a
depositor's total deposits with the bank and 90% of the next (pound)33,000,
resulting in a maximum payment of (pound)31,700 (these limits are subject to
certain exceptions). A bank's total liability to a depositor is the aggregate
of all accounts in the name of that depositor, in all currencies. The Scheme
only covers deposits at offices within the European Economic Area.
</P>
<P>
Other compensation limits for the Scheme are as follows. Compensation for
investments is limited to (pound)48,000 (100% of the first (pound)30,000 and
90% of the next (pound)20,000). Compensation for long term insurance is 100% of
the first (pound)2,000 and a minimum of 90% of the value of the policyholder's
policy (including future benefits declared before the date of default). For
compulsory general insurance, compensation is 100% of a valid claim or
unexpired premium and for non-compulsory general insurance, compensation is
limited to 100% of the first (pound)2,000 of a valid claim or unexpired premium
and 90% of the remainder of the claim.
</P>
<DIV CLASS="eolCenter">
15
</DIV>
<HR CLASS="eolPageBreak">
<DIV CLASS="eolNewPage"></DIV>
<A NAME="eolPage16"></A>
<P>
The Scheme will be financed by levies made on authorised institutions. There
are three types of management expenses levies - the base costs levy (paid by
all firms participating in the Scheme and allocated to individual firms in
proportion to the periodic fees they pay to the FSA. These cover administrative
costs, costs of premises, salaries and related overheads etc); the specific
costs levy (this covers all remaining management expenses and are directly
related to the handling of claims and payment of compensation); and the
establishment costs levy (which covers the costs of establishing the Scheme).
The Funding Rules require a limit to be set on the total of all management
expenses attributable to each financial year and the Scheme cannot make any
levies to recover management expenses for the year until this limit is set.
</P>
<P>
UK banking business
</P>
<P>
The FSA sets standards and prudential requirements for, and provides guidance
to the banks under its supervision. Banks are required to submit regular
returns to the FSA, which provide material for supervisory assessment. Senior
management of banks also meet regularly with the FSA to discuss relevant issues
such as risk control, loan portfolio composition, profitability, capital
adequacy and liquidity management, organisational changes and operating
practices. In its supervisory role, the FSA issues rules and guidance under
powers contained in the FSMA 2000. The FSA's 'Handbook of Rules and Guidance'
contains various sections including 'The Interim Prudential Sourcebook for
Banks' which contains provisions relating to, amongst other matters, the
implementation of consolidated supervision, capital adequacy, liquidity and
foreign currency exposure, large exposures to related borrowers, the adequacy
of accounting procedures and controls, the FSA's relationship with a bank's
external auditors and loan transfers and securitisation of loans.
</P>
<P>
Capital adequacy
</P>
<P>
A bank is required to maintain adequate capital to absorb losses arising from
the risks in its business. The basic capital adequacy framework is that set by
the 1988 Basel Accord, as amended, and implemented in the European Union by
various Directives. The capital adequacy regime requires a bank to maintain
certain levels of capital, which must be of certain specified types (or tiers),
against particular business risks. The specific regime currently applying to
banks in the UK is set out in more detail in the FSA's Interim Prudential
Sourcebook for Banks.
</P>
<P>
The FSA is in the process of reviewing the prudential requirements applying to
the different types of financial businesses in the UK with a view to publishing
an Integrated Prudential Sourcebook, expected to apply a more harmonised and
consistent approach to prudential regulation across the UK financial services
industry.
</P>
<P>
Currently, proposals to amend the 1988 Basel Accord are also being considered.
The original timetable for this has been subject to delays and while the
revised Accord is expected to be completed by 2005, national implementation
under a European Community Directive is not expected until 2006 at the
earliest.
</P>
<P>
Originally the FSA's Integrated Prudential Sourcebook was due to be fully
implemented at the beginning of 2004. However, the delays to the implementation
of the new Basel Capital Accord (and the related EU legislation) have impacted
the FSA's timetable. Currently the FSA is considering various alternatives for
implementing the provisions of the new Sourcebook.
</P>
<P>
Large exposures
</P>
<P>
Banks are required to set out their policy on large exposures and to provide
the FSA with a copy of that statement. This policy must be reviewed on an
annual basis and any significant departures from policies must be discussed
with the FSA in advance of incorporating them into a policy statement. A bank
must have systems and controls in place to monitor and control its large
exposures.
</P>
<P>
The FSA requires banks to report, and in some cases obtain consent for, large
single exposures and large exposures to related borrowers. A UK bank is
required to notify the FSA where it proposes to enter into an exposure
exceeding 25% of its capital. Generally, a bank should not have individual
exposures exceeding 25% of its Large Exposures Capital Base, but this limit is
subject to certain exceptions.
</P>
<P>
<SPAN STYLE="font-weight: bold">
Liquidity
</SPAN>
</P>
<P>
Banks are required to formulate a statement of their policy for managing
liquidity and to agree with the FSA guidelines by which adherence to this
policy can be assessed. Adequate systems must be in place for monitoring
liquidity on a daily basis. The FSA monitors the liquidity of the UK banking
sector through a series of periodic returns.

UK investment business
</P>
<P>
With the implementation of the FSMA 2000, the FSA has assumed the
responsibilities and powers of the various self-regulating organisations and
recognised professional bodies in relation to the regulation and supervision of
investment businesses. The specific regulatory capital regime currently
applying to investment businesses in the UK is set out in more detail in the
FSA's Interim Prudential Sourcebook for Investment Businesses. The detailed
conduct of business rules applying to investment-related activities are set out
in the FSA's Conduct of Business Sourcebook.
</P>
<P>
Pursuant to rules promulgated under the FSA 1986 and continued under the FSMA
2000, regulated entities such as RBS plc and NWB Plc are currently required to
determine whether to market packaged products (i.e. personal pensions, life
assurance, collective investment schemes and investment trust savings schemes)
of only one company or group or to become an independent intermediary providing
customers with advice across a broader range of products. A group of persons
allied together for purposes of marketing the packaged products of a marketing
group is referred to as a &quot;marketing group&quot;. This regime (referred to as
&quot;polarisation&quot;) is currently being reviewed. The FSA has published a
consultation paper setting out three options for reforming the regime, including
outright abolition which is the FSA's preferred option. The consultation period
ends on 19 April 2002 and the FSA intends to introduce changes to the
polarisation regime before the end of 2002.
</P>
<P>
On 1 October 1990, Royal Scottish Assurance plc (&quot;RSA&quot;), a life assurance joint
venture company, commenced operations offering a full range of unit-linked,
pension, life assurance, investment and mortgage insurance products. RBS plc,
which originally held a stake in RSA, subsequently acquired the whole of this
company, and in December 2000, it sold RSA to RBS Life Investments Limited
(&quot;RLI&quot;), a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. At the same time NWB Plc
sold National Westminster Life Assurance Limited (&quot;NWL&quot;) to RLI. Shortly
thereafter, the composite insurer CGNU plc, acting through its life assurance
subsidiary, acquired a 49.999% stake in RLI, effectively establishing the
businesses of RSA and NWL as joint ventures between the Company and CGNU plc.
</P>
<P>
Currently, the Group companies are members of one of two marketing groups. Apart
from RSA, the RBS Marketing Group includes the product provider Royal Bank of
Scotland Unit Trust Management Limited (&quot;RBSUTM&quot;) which provides collective
investment scheme products. Apart from NWL, the NatWest Marketing Group includes
the product providers, Gartmore Investment Limited (&quot;GIL&quot;) and Gartmore Fund
Managers Limited (&quot;GFM&quot;), both providing collective investment scheme products.
None of RBSUTM, GIL or GFM are members of the RBS Group of companies.
</P>
<P>
RBS plc markets the packaged products of the RBS Marketing Group through its
branches and NWB Plc (and its subsidiary, Ulster Bank Limited) markets the
NatWest Marketing Group packaged products through its branches and neither RBS
plc nor NWB Plc (or Ulster Bank Limited) are permitted to provide advice in
relation to these types of products more generally. However, independent advice
is currently available to those customers who may require it through The Royal
Bank of Scotland Group Independent Financial Services Limited, a member of the
RBS Group of companies.
</P>
<P>
UK life assurance and general insurance business
</P>
<P>
With the implementation of the FSMA 2000, the FSA has formally assumed
responsibility for supervising the activities of UK insurance companies from
the Treasury and these companies are now subject to the FSMA 2000.
</P>
<P>
The businesses of RSA, NWL and the insurance companies in the Direct Line Group
(which includes companies authorised to write general 'non-life' business) are
subject to the prudential regulation of the FSA, which sets requirements
relating to 'margins of solvency' (i.e. the excess of the value of assets over
the amount of liabilities). Sales of life insurance policies are also subject to
conduct of business regulated by the FSA. Companies carrying out insurance
business in the UK are required to submit regular statistical returns covering
reserves and solvency, to the FSA. The detailed requirements in this respect are
currently contained in the FSA's Interim Prudential Sourcebook for Insurers.
</P>
<P>
<SPAN STYLE="font-weight: bold">
United States
</SPAN>
</P>
<P>
As the indirect parent of Citizens' subsidiary banks, the Company is subject to
regulation under the US Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (the
&quot;BHCA&quot;), by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the &quot;Board&quot;).
Under current Board policy, the Company is expected to act as a source of
financial strength to its US bank subsidiaries. The BHCA generally prohibits the
Company from acquiring, directly or indirectly, the ownership or control of more
than 5% of the voting shares of any company engaged in non-banking activities in
the United States unless the Board has determined, by order or regulation, that
such activities are so closely related to banking or managing or controlling
banks as to be a proper incident thereto. In addition, the BHCA requires the
Company to obtain the prior approval of the Board before acquiring, directly or
indirectly, the ownership or control of more than 5% of the voting shares of any
US bank or bank holding company. Although the US Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999
permits bank holding companies that have met certain eligibility criteria and
elected to become 'financial holding companies' to engage in a significantly
broader range of non-banking activities than those described above, the Company
has not elected to become a financial holding company.

The Company's US bank and non-bank subsidiaries, and RBS's and NatWest's US
offices, are subject to direct supervision and regulation by various other
federal and state authorities. Citizens' bank subsidiaries are subject to
regulation by state banking authorities and the US Federal Deposit Insurance
Corporation and RBS plc's and NWB Plc's New York branches are supervised by the
New York Banking Department. The Company's US securities affiliates are subject
to regulation and supervision by the Securities and Exchange Commission.

Westminster Bank Plc, GRS Holding Company Limited (the holding company of Angel
Train Contracts Limited) and RBS Life Holdings Limited. Details of the
principal subsidiary undertakings of the Group are given in Note 19 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements.
</P>
<P>
RBS and NatWest are discussed under 'History and Development of the Company'.
Angel Train Contracts Limited was acquired in 1997 and is the Group's rail

At 31 December 2001, the Group operated from approximately 3,690 (31 December
2000 - 3,200) locations world-wide, principally in the UK. RBS and NatWest had
644 and 1,643 retail branches, respectively, in the UK. Citizens had 712 retail
banking offices at 31 December 2001 covering Rhode Island, Connecticut,
Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Pennsylvania, Delaware, and New Jersey. A
substantial majority of the UK branches are owned by RBS, NatWest and their
subsidiaries or are held under leases with unexpired terms of over 50 years.
The Group's principal properties include its headquarters at St Andrew
Square, Edinburgh, its principal offices in London at 135 Bishopsgate and
Waterhouse Square, the administration centre at Regent's House, London and the
Drummond House administration centre located at South Gyle, Edinburgh. On 7
March 2002, a planning application for a new world headquarters was lodged.
Subject to receiving the appropriate planning consents, the proposed
development at Gogarburn, Edinburgh, is expected to be completed in 2006.
</P>
<P>
From 2000, freehold and long leasehold properties are revalued on a rolling
basis, each property being valued at least once every five years. Interim
valuations outwith the five year cycle will be carried out on properties where
there is an indication that its value has changed significantly, given market
conditions. Previously, it was the Group's policy to carry out annual
valuations of its principal freehold and long leasehold (more than fifty years
unexpired) premises. Any increase or deficit on revaluation is reflected in the
carrying value of premises at that time. Any impairment in the value of
premises where there is a clear consumption of economic benefits is charged in
full to the profit and loss account. Other impairments of premises are charged
to the profit and loss account after eliminating any previous revaluation
surplus on the premises. Any profit from the sale of revalued premises is
calculated by deducting the revalued amount from the net proceeds. The
revaluation of premises at 31 December 2001, resulted in a (pound)72 million
increase in property revaluation reserves.
</P>
<P>
Total capital expenditure on premises, computers and other equipment for the
year ended 31 December 2001 was (pound)515 million (year ended 31 December 2000

Environmental issues
</P>
<P>
Environmental and social imperatives continue to shape the future, and the
diversity and flexibility of the Group's businesses enables it to anticipate
and respond to these changes. Business excellence, of necessity, requires that
the Group meets changing customer, shareholder, investor, employee and supplier
expectations and the Group acknowledges that environmental, social and ethical
responsibility is key to the way it does business.
</P>
<P>
To assist in creating value for all stakeholders the Group has adopted policies
which progressively integrate environment and social issues into all aspects of
its business activities. The objective of these policies is to manage the
obvious tangible operational impacts on the environment such as energy, raw
material, waste and transport and to create additional value through the
development of new markets, new products and improved ways of delivering the
Group's services.
</P>
<P>
These principles are driven by the Group's corporate values, underpinned by its
management procedures and are reinforced through the Group internal and
external social, community and environmental programmes.

OPERATING RESULTS
</SPAN>
</P>
<P>
The acquisition of NatWest had a significant effect on the Group's financial
position and as a consequence, comparisons with the prior year on a statutory
basis (which only includes NatWest from 6 March 2000) are of limited benefit.
In order to provide additional relevant and meaningful information, pro forma
results for the years ended 31 December 2000 and 31 December 1999 have also
been prepared on the assumption that NatWest was acquired on 1 January 1999.
This approach facilitates meaningful comparisons with prior years and provides
a benchmark against which the Group's current and future performance can be
judged. Comparisons with the pro forma results are referred to as 'pro forma
basis' and follow the discussion of the Group's results on a statutory basis.
</P>
<P>
Critical accounting policies
</P>
<P>
The reported results of the Group are sensitive to the accounting policies,
assumptions and estimates that underlie the preparation of its financial
statements. The Group's principal accounting policies are set out on pages 137
to 139. UK company law and accounting standards require the directors, in
preparing the Group's financial statements, to select suitable accounting
policies, apply them consistently and make judgements and estimates that are
reasonable and prudent. Where UK GAAP allows a choice of policy, FRS 18
'Accounting Policies' requires an entity to adopt those policies judged to be
most appropriate to its particular circumstances for the purpose of giving a
true and fair view.
</P>
<P>
The judgements and uncertainties involved in the Group's accounting policies
that are most important to the portrayal of its financial condition are
discussed below. The use of estimates, assumptions or models that differed from
those adopted by the Group would affect its reported results.
</P>
<P>
Loans and advances - provisions for bad and doubtful debts
</P>
<P>
The Group provides for bad and doubtful debts so as to state its loan portfolio
at its expected ultimate net realisable value. Specific provisions are
established against individual exposures and the general provision covers
advances impaired at the balance sheet date but which have not been identified
as such. For exposures that are individually assessed, the specific provision
is determined from a review of the financial condition of the counterparty and
any guarantor and takes into account the value of any security. For certain
portfolios of homogeneous loans, specific provisions are established on a
portfolio basis, based on historical loss experience and the level of arrears.
The general provision is assessed in the light of general economic conditions,
the size and diversity of the Group's portfolio, a review of internal credit
risk classifications and the scope of specific provisioning procedures.
</P>
<P>
Loans and advances  - recognition of interest income
</P>
<P>
Interest is accrued on loans and advances unless its receipt is in significant
doubt. Doubtful interest is not credited to the profit and loss account but to
an interest in suspense account. Interest is not accrued on loans that have
been written down i.e. where a provision has been applied.
</P>
<P>
Fair value
</P>
<P>
Securities and derivatives held for trading purposes, are carried at fair value
with changes in this value reflected in the profit and loss account. Fair
values are based on quoted market prices where available. If quoted prices are
not available for an instrument, fair value is determined from market prices
for its components using appropriate pricing models. Where the Group's position
is of such a size that the price obtainable would be materially different from
the quoted price, the quoted price is adjusted based on management's estimate
of the price that the Group would realise from the holding in current market
conditions.
</P>
<P>
Where instruments such as over-the-counter derivatives are valued using pricing
models, the value of the instrument and changes in that value are affected by
the model and its underlying assumptions.
</P>
<P>
General insurance claims
</P>
<P>
The Group makes provision for the full cost of settling outstanding claims at
the balance sheet date, including claims estimated to have been incurred but
not yet reported at that date and claims handling expenses.

Overview of results - statutory basis (continued)
</P>
<P>
Year ended 31 December 2001 and 31 December 2000 - statutory basis
</P>
<P>
The year ended 31 December 2001 includes a full year's results of NatWest
whereas the year ended 31 December 2000 only included the results of NatWest
from the date of its acquisition, 6 March 2000. This has contributed to the year
on year variances in addition to factors included in the following discussion on
a statutory basis.
</P>
<P>
<SPAN STYLE="font-weight: bold">
Profit
</SPAN>
</P>
<P>
Profit before tax at (pound)4,275 million for the year ended 31 December 2001
was up 44%, (pound)1,305 million, from (pound)2,970 million for the year ended
31 December 2000. All businesses contributed to this improvement.
</P>
<P>
Total income
</P>
<P>
Total income rose by 33%, (pound)3,586 million, to (pound)14,581 million.
</P>
<P>
Net interest income
</P>
<P>
Net interest income increased by 30%, (pound)1,583 million, to (pound)6,869
million due to strong growth in lending and deposits across all businesses.
</P>
<P>
Non-interest income
</P>
<P>
Non-interest income, excluding net general insurance premiums, grew by 33%,
<BR>
(pound)1,578 million, to (pound)6,337 million. Fees and commissions receivable
were up 31%, (pound)1,121 million, to (pound)4,735 million. Dealing profits
increased by 53%, (pound)493 million, to (pound)1,426 million due to increased
customer activity and favourable market conditions. Other operating income was
20%, (pound)178 million higher at (pound)1,052 million.
</P>
<P>
General insurance premium income, after reinsurance, increased by 45%,
<BR>
(pound)425 million, to (pound)1,375 million.
</P>
<P>
Total expenses
</P>
<P>
Operating expenses rose by 24%, (pound)1,607 million, to (pound)8,367 million
including integration costs of (pound)875 million (2000 - (pound)389 million).
Staff expenses were up 24%, (pound)785 million to (pound)4,059 million. Other
expenses were up 24%, (pound)822 million, to (pound)4,308 million.
</P>
<P>
General insurance claims, after reinsurance, increased by 41%, (pound)275
million, to (pound)948 million.
</P>
<P>
<SPAN STYLE="font-weight: bold">
Provisions
</SPAN>
</P>
<P>
New provisions were up 42%, (pound)315 million to (pound)1,071 million. This
increase reflects the growth in lending and the deterioration in the short-term
economic outlook combined with the impact of a small number of specific customer
situations. Recoveries of amounts previously written off were down (pound)84
million, 51% to (pound)80 million. Consequently, the net charge to the profit
and loss account was up from (pound)592 million to (pound)991 million.
</P>
<P>
Total balance sheet provisions for bad and doubtful debts amounted to
<BR>
(pound)3,653 million (31 December 2000 - (pound)3,153 million) equivalent to
81% (31 December 2000 - 83%) of risk elements in lending.
</P>
<P>
<SPAN STYLE="font-weight: bold">
Goodwill
</SPAN>
</P>
<P>
Citizens completed the acquisition of the regional retail and commercial
banking operations of Mellon Financial Corporation on 1 December 2001 for a
cash consideration of US$2.2 billion ((pound)1,564 million). The goodwill
arising on this acquisition amounted to (pound)1,655 million.
</P>
<P>
<SPAN STYLE="font-weight: bold">
Integration
</SPAN>
</P>
<P>
Integration now comprises two elements:
</P>
<P>
<SPAN STYLE="font-weight: bold">
NatWest
</SPAN>
</P>
<P>
Integration costs were (pound)847 million compared with (pound)345 million in
2000. Good progress continues to be made in integrating NatWest. Implementation
has been faster which has resulted in revenue benefits and cost savings being
achieved ahead of plan. In addition to value being created earlier than planned,
additional revenue benefits and cost savings have been identified which are
expected to result in combined annual benefits being (pound)300 million more
than plan giving a benefit of (pound)2.0 billion per annum at the end of the
programme.
</P>
<P>
As a consequence of the accelerated implementation and the additional benefits,
the cumulative profits from the integration programme to the end of 2003 are
expected to be (pound)5.5 billion. This is (pound)1.4 billion greater than the
planned (pound)4.1 billion and the overall cost of the programme is now
estimated to be (pound)2.3 billion against a plan of (pound)1.4 billion.
</P>
<P>
<SPAN STYLE="font-weight: bold">
Mellon
</SPAN>
</P>
<P>
Mellon was acquired in December 2001 and expenditure of (pound)28 million was
incurred in the early stages of integrating Mellon with Citizens. No benefits
from this integration have yet been recognised.

<P>
Overview of results - statutory basis (continued)
</P>
<P>
Tax charge
</P>
<P>
The tax charge for the year was (pound)1,537 million, equivalent to 36% of
profit before tax of (pound)4,275 million. The rate was affected by goodwill
amortisation, which is not allowable for UK tax purposes. The effective tax
rate after adjusting for goodwill amortisation was 31% (2000 - 30%).
</P>
<P>
Shareholder returns
</P>
<P>
Earnings per share, adjusted for goodwill amortisation, integration costs and
the dividend on the Additional Value Shares (&quot;AVS&quot;), increased from 102.1 pence
to 127.9 pence.
</P>
<P>
The first dividend of 15.0 pence per share was paid on the AVS issued in
connection with the acquisition of NatWest. This was paid on 3 December 2001 in
accordance with the original payment schedule.
</P>
<P>
A final dividend of 27.0 pence per ordinary share is recommended resulting in a
total dividend for the year of 38.0 pence per ordinary share, up 15% on 2000.
The total ordinary dividend is covered 3.3 times by earnings before goodwill
amortisation, integration costs and the AVS dividend.
</P>
<P>
Profit attributable to ordinary shareholders after tax, minority interests,
preference dividends and perpetual securities interests, at (pound)2,267
million, increased by 42%. After deducting the dividend on the AVS,
attributable profit increased by 17%, from (pound)1,593 million to (pound)1,868
million.
</P>
<P>
Return of equity
</P>
<P>
Group post-tax return on average equity, adjusted for goodwill, integration
costs and the AVS dividend increased from 39.5% to 41.1%.
</P>
<P>
Balance sheet
</P>
<P>
Group total assets were (pound)369 billion at 31 December 2001, of which
<BR>
(pound)285 billion (77%) related to banking business and (pound)84 billion
(23%) to trading business.
</P>
<P>
Loans and advances to customers at 31 December 2001 were (pound)190 billion, up
13% from (pound)168 billion at 31 December 2000. Customer deposits increased by
12% from (pound)177 billion to (pound)199 billion.
</P>
<P>
Capital ratios at 31 December 2001 were 7.1% (tier 1) and 11.5% (total)
compared with 6.9% (tier 1) and 11.5% (total) at 31 December 2000.
</P>
<P>
Year ended 31 December 2000 compared with the year ended 30 September 1999 -
statutory basis
</P>
<P>
Profit before tax for the year ended 31 December 2000 increased by (pound)1,759
million, to (pound)2,970 million primarily reflecting the inclusion of NatWest
from 6 March 2000.
</P>
<P>
Total income increased by (pound)6,893 million to (pound)10,995 million
reflecting the acquisition of NatWest, together with the impact of balance
sheet growth on net interest income and non-interest income and higher
insurance premium income.
</P>
<P>
Net interest income increased by (pound)3,538 million to (pound)5,286 million
mainly due to the acquisition of NatWest and volume growth of loans and
deposits. Average interest earning assets of the banking business rose by
<BR>
(pound)108.2 billion reflecting the acquisition of NatWest and growth in
corporate and personal lending. Net interest margin increased from 2.5% to 3.0%.
</P>
<P>
Non-interest income, excluding general insurance, increased by (pound)3,115
million, to (pound)4,759 million primarily reflecting the impact of NatWest,
and also organic growth in fees as a result of higher lending volumes. General
insurance premium income, after reinsurance, increased by 34%, (pound)240
million, to (pound)950 million due to strong growth in earned premiums. The
acquisition of Green Flag accounted for (pound)136 million of the growth in
earned premiums.
</P>
<P>
Operating expenses, including goodwill amortisation and integration costs, were
up (pound)4,738 million to (pound)6,760 million reflecting the impact of
NatWest, higher administrative expenses due to increased operational activities
and (pound)536 million increase in goodwill amortisation reflecting the
acquisition of NatWest and other acquisitions by Citizens and Direct Line.
</P>
<P>
Cost: income ratio, including goodwill amortisation and integration costs
increased from 49.3% to 61.5%, primarily due to the higher cost:income ratio in
NatWest.
</P>
<P>
General insurance claims, after reinsurance, increased by 14%, (pound)83
million, to (pound)673 million.

Overview of results - statutory basis (continued)
</P>
<P>
Goodwill arising on the acquisition of NatWest, after provisional fair value
adjustments made in 2000, was (pound)11,390 million. This goodwill, being
amortised over its estimated economic life of 20 years, resulted in a charge for
goodwill amortisation of (pound)537 million for the year ended 31 December 2000.
The provisional fair value adjustments made in 2000 were finalised in 2001.
</P>
<P>
Integration costs of (pound)389 million have been included in the statutory
profit and loss account for the year ended 31 December 2000.
</P>
<P>
Provisions for bad and doubtful debts were up (pound)284 million to (pound)550
million. Total provisions at 31 December 2000 were 83% of risk elements in
lending, compared with 67% at 30 September 1999. Amounts written off
investments increased from (pound)13 million to (pound)42 million.

Net interest income - statutory basis (continued)
</P>
<P>
Year ended 31 December 2001 compared with the year ended 31 December 2000
</P>
<P>
Net interest income increased 30%, (pound)1,583 million, to (pound)6,869
million primarily reflecting good growth in both corporate and personal lending
deposits. Average interest-earning assets of the Group's banking business
increased by 24%, including 27% growth in average loans and advances to
customers.
</P>
<P>
Net interest margin of the banking business improved from 3.0% to 3.1%. Improved
lending spread, together with the benefit of income from the proceeds of the
market placing of ordinary shares in July 2001, prior to deployment in the
Mellon acquisition in 31 December 2001, contributed to this increase and
more than offset a decrease in deposit margins.
</P>
<P>
Year ended 31 December 2000 compared with the year ended 30 September 1999
</P>
<P>
Net interest income increased (pound)3,538 million to (pound)5,286 million
mainly due to the acquisition of NatWest and growth in loans and deposits.
Average interest-earning assets of the banking business rose by (pound)108.2
billion reflecting the acquisition of NatWest and growth in corporate and
personal lending.
</P>
<P>
Interest spread increased 0.2% to 2.3% primarily due to the acquisition of
NatWest and the disposal of the low margin Trust Bank business. Net
interest-free funds rose by (pound)17.4 billion primarily due to NatWest and,
together with the effect of higher interest rates, this led to an increase in
the benefit from interest-free funds. As a result, the net interest margin of
the banking business increased from 2.5% to 3.0%.

Changes in net interest income - volume and rate analysis - statutory basis
</P>
<P>
The following table allocates changes in net interest income between volume and
rate for the year ended 31 December 2001 compared with the year ended 31
December 2000 and for the year ended 31 December 2000 compared with the year
ended 30 September 1999. Volume and rate variances have been calculated based
on movements in average balances over the period and changes in interest rates
on average interest-earning assets and average interest-bearing liabilities.
Changes due to a combination of volume and rate are allocated pro rata to
volume and rate movements.

Operating expenses rose by 24%, (pound)1,607 million, to (pound)8,367 million,

New provisions were up 42%, (pound)315 million to (pound)1,071 million,
reflecting growth in lending, and the deterioration in short-term economic
outlook combined with the impact of a small number of specific customer
situations. Recoveries of amounts previously written off were down (pound)84
million, 51%, to (pound)80 million. Consequently, the net charge to the profit
and loss account was up from (pound)592 million to (pound)991 million. Total
balance sheet provisions at 31 December 2001 were (pound)3,653 million (31
December 2000 - (pound)3,153 million), equivalent to 81% (31 December 2000 -

The tax charge for the year ended 31 December 2001 was (pound)1,537 million,
equivalent to 36% of profit before tax of (pound)4,275 million. The rate is
affected by goodwill amortisation, which is not allowable for UK tax purposes.
The effective rate after adjusting for goodwill amortisation was 31%.
</P>
<P>
The tax charge of (pound)1,033 million for the year ended 31 December 2000
equivalent to 34.8% of profit before tax of (pound)2,970 million, is higher
than the standard UK tax rate of 30% mainly due to goodwill amortisation, which
is not allowable for UK tax.
</P>
<P>
The effective tax rate of 29.8% for the year ended 30 September 1999 was lower
than the average UK corporation tax rate of 30.5%. This was primarily due to
profits outwith the UK being subject to lower taxation rates.

The acquisition of NatWest had a significant effect on the Group's financial
position and as a consequence comparisons with the prior year on a statutory
basis are of limited benefit in understanding the performance of the Group.
This is most marked for Corporate Banking and Financial Markets, Retail
Banking, Retail Direct, Manufacturing and Wealth Management where the
acquisition of NatWest has significantly increased the scale of operations for
these divisions.

<P>
Contribution before manufacturing costs was up 24%, (pound)589 million, to
<BR>
(pound)3,011 million. The results for the year ended 31 December 2001 include a
full year's contribution from NatWest whereas the year ended 31 December 2000
only includes NatWest from the date of its acquisition, 6 March 2000. This,
together with factors discussed below, has contributed to the improvement in
performance.
</P>
<P>
Total income was up 32%, (pound)1,318 million to (pound)5,404 million. Net
interest income was up 33%, (pound)517 million, to (pound)2,100 million,
largely due to lending growth in Corporate Banking and also as a result of
favourable market conditions in Financial Markets.
</P>
<P>
Non-interest income was up 32%, (pound)801 million, to (pound)3,304 million
reflecting growth in customer advances, payment and transmission related fees
and dealing profits.
</P>
<P>
Direct expenses were up 30%, (pound)435 million, to (pound)1,899 million mainly
due to performance related payments to staff reflecting higher income in
Financial Markets, increased business volumes and infrastructure costs
supporting European expansion and acquisitions.
</P>
<P>
Provisions were up (pound)294 million to (pound)494 million reflecting growth
in lending, the global economic slowdown, a small number of specific customer
situations and lower recoveries, partially offset by a reduction in amounts
written off investments.
</P>
<P>
Year ended 31 December 2000 compared with the year ended 30 September 1999
</P>
<P>
Contribution before manufacturing costs was up (pound)1,642 million to
<BR>
(pound)2,422 million.
</P>
<P>
Total income increased by (pound)2,761 million to (pound)4,086 million
primarily as a result of the acquisition of NatWest.
</P>
<P>
Net interest income increased by (pound)1,060 million to (pound)1,583 million
mainly due to the inclusion of NatWest in 2000, together with lending and
deposit growth. Non-interest income was up by (pound)1,701 million to
<BR>
(pound)2,503 million, reflecting the impact of NatWest and increased deal
opportunities in Leveraged, Structured and Asset Finance during 2000.
</P>
<P>
Direct expenses increased by (pound)1,026 million to (pound)1,464 million as a
result of higher costs across all cost categories resulting from the inclusion
of NatWest in 2000.
</P>
<P>
Provisions were up (pound)93 million to (pound)200 million due to provisions
for bad and doubtful debts increasing by (pound)63 million to (pound)158
million and, amounts written off investments were (pound)42 million (1999:
<BR>
(pound)12 million) primarily reflecting a restructuring of the development
capital investment portfolio.

<P>
Contribution before manufacturing costs was up 62%, (pound)210 million to
<BR>
(pound)551 million. The results for the year ended 31 December 2001 include a
full year's contribution from NatWest whereas the year ended 31 December 2000

<P>
Total income was up 41%, (pound)396 million to (pound)1,370 million driven
largely by strong performances in cards and TPF. Net interest income was up

(pound)201 million to (pound)674 million. Average mortgage lending in DLFS was
17% higher at (pound)2.1 billion and in VDPF the increase was 81%, from

(pound)1.7 billion to (pound)3.1 billion. TPF increased average customer
advances and customer deposits by 15% to (pound)1.8 billion, and 29% to
<BR>
(pound)1.4 billion respectively.
</P>
<P>
Non-interest income rose 39%, (pound)195 million to (pound)696 million largely
as a result of increased fees reflecting higher retailer volumes.
</P>
<P>
Direct expenses at (pound)564 million were 32%, (pound)137 million higher,
largely as a result of increased business volumes and marketing activity.
</P>
<P>
Provisions for bad and doubtful debts increased by 24%, (pound)49 million to
<BR>
(pound)255 million reflecting the increase in unsecured lending.

(pound)341 million.
</P>
<P>
Total income increased by (pound)651 million to (pound)974 million, primarily
reflecting the inclusion of NatWest.
</P>
<P>
Net interest income was up (pound)257 million to (pound)473 million due to the
acquisition of NatWest, higher volumes of personal loans and savings in TPF and
increased net interest income from VDPF and DLFS reflecting significant growth
in mortgage lending volumes.
</P>
<P>
Non-interest income increased by (pound)394 million to (pound)501 million, due
primarily to the acquisition of NatWest and also higher card transaction
volumes and increased fee income resulting from volume growth.
</P>
<P>
Direct expenses increased by (pound)265 million to (pound)427 million
reflecting the acquisition of NatWest, increased business volumes and higher
marketing activity.
</P>
<P>
Provisions for bad and doubtful debts increased by (pound)121 million to

*    Ulster Bank became part of the Group on 6 March 2000 on the acquisition of
NatWest. The results above are therefore only for the period from 6 March
2000 to 31 December 2000.

<P>
Profit before integration costs for the year ended 31 December 2001 of
<BR>
(pound)242 million was 48%, (pound)78 million, higher than (pound)164 million
for the period from 6 March 2000 to 31 December 2000.
</P>
<P>
Total income increased by 40%, (pound)152 million to (pound)536 million. Net
interest income rose by 43%, (pound)106 million to (pound)351 million due to
strong growth in customer loans and deposits. Average loans and advances to
customers increased to (pound)8.3 billion, and average customer deposits
increased to (pound)7.3 billion. The number of customers increased to 744,000
at 31 December 2001.
</P>
<P>
Non-interest income was up 33%, (pound)46 million to (pound)185 million. The
increase is mainly due to higher card, lending and transmission fees.
</P>
<P>
Expenses rose by 32%, (pound)66 million to (pound)271 million to support
business expansion. Staff costs increased by 23%, (pound)27 million. Other
expenses increased by 46%, (pound)39 million as a result of higher depreciation
on operating lease assets, marketing costs to support business expansion and
expenditure related to the preparation for the issue of Euro notes and coins in
the Republic of Ireland.
</P>
<P>
Provisions for bad and doubtful debts were up 53%, (pound)8 million, to
<BR>
(pound)23 million. The increase is largely due to growth in lending.

</P>
<P>
Profit before goodwill amortisation and integration costs was up 44%,
<BR>
(pound)152 million to (pound)501 million reflecting strong organic growth and
the strengthening of the dollar. The Mellon acquisition, completed on 1
December 2001, contributed (pound)13 million to this increase, (pound)10.1
billion to customer deposits, (pound)4.4 billion to customer loans and advances
and added 345 branches to the Citizens network, bringing the total number of
branches to 712 at 31 December 2001.
</P>
<P>
Net interest income rose by 22%, (pound)147 million to (pound)814 million due
to growth in customer deposits and secured consumer lending. Non-interest
income was up 24%, (pound)59 million to (pound)306 million reflecting growth in
deposit service charges, mortgage banking and ATM and debit card income.
</P>
<P>
Expenses at (pound)550 million were 5%, (pound)25 million higher reflecting
organic growth, the Mellon acquisition and the effect of exchange rates. At
constant exchange rates expenses declined by 1%, (pound)3 million.

<P>
Profit before goodwill amortisation and integration costs increased by 44%,
<BR>
(pound)107 million to (pound)349 million. Of the increase, the acquisition of
the commercial banking businesses of State Street on 1 October 1999 and UST
Corp. on 1 January 2000 contributed an estimated (pound)50 million after
funding costs of (pound)40 million. Strong organic growth and the strengthening

Total income increased by 66%, (pound)365 million to (pound)914 million.
</P>
<P>
Net interest income rose by 63%, (pound)259 million to (pound)667 million, due

Overview of results - pro forma basis
</P>
<P>
Results for the three years ended 31 December 2001 - pro forma basis
</P>
<P>
In the following discussion, the results for the year ended 31 December 2001,
adjusted for the presentation of goodwill amortisation and integration costs,
are compared with the pro forma results for the years ended 31 December 2000
and 31 December 1999.
</P>
<P>
Basis of preparation and presentation of results
</P>
<P>
The acquisition of NatWest on 6 March 2000 had a significant effect on the
Group's financial position. Comparison with the prior period on a statutory
basis (which includes NatWest from 6 March 2000) is of limited benefit.
Accordingly, in order to provide more meaningful and relevant comparatives, pro
forma results for the years ended 31 December 2000 and 31 December 1999 have
been prepared assuming that the acquisition of NatWest took place on 1 January
1999.
</P>
<P>
(a)  Basis of preparation
</P>
<P>
The profit and loss account for the year ended 31 December 2001 is
extracted from the audited financial statements, modified as described in
note (b) below.
</P>
<P>
The pro forma results for the years ended 31 December 2000 and 31 December
1999 have been prepared on the following basis:
</P>
<P>
(i)  They incorporate the full year results of NatWest for 2000 and 1999
and assume that the fair value adjustments were made on 31 December
1998.
</P>
<P>
(ii) Goodwill arising on the acquisition of NatWest of (pound)11,483
million has been amortised over its estimated economic life of 20
years.
</P>
<P>
Goodwill arising on other acquisitions made by the Group after 1
January 1999 has been amortised from the effective dates of
acquisition, generally also over 20 years. Goodwill arising on
acquisitions prior to 1 January 1999 was written off directly to
reserves and has not been reinstated, as permitted by FRS 10.
</P>
<P>
(iii) A surplus of (pound)1,070 million in NatWest Pension Funds has been
amortised, from 1 January 1999, over the estimated average remaining
service life of members of the schemes.
</P>
<P>
(iv) An adjustment has been made to reflect the net funding of the
acquisition of NatWest as if acquired on 1 January 1999. The net
funding comprises cash paid and loan notes issued to NatWest
shareholders of (pound)7,349 million and fees and expenses relating
to the acquisition of (pound)176 million less net proceeds of
<BR>
(pound)3,910 million from the issue of new ordinary and preference
shares and (pound)20 million of proceeds from the exercise of options
over NatWest ordinary shares.
</P>
<P>
(v)  The results of businesses disposed of since 1 January 1999 and the
profit arising on their sale have been excluded from the pro forma
results. The principal disposals were RBS Trust Bank, Gartmore and
the venture capital investments of NatWest. A funding adjustment has
been made to recognise the benefit of estimated net proceeds of
<BR>
(pound)1,500 million assuming that these funds were received on 1
January 1999.
</P>
<P>
(b)  Basis of presentation
</P>
<P>
The results for the year ended 31 December 2001 and the pro forma results
for the years ended 31 December 2000 and 31 December 1999 have been
presented on the following basis:
</P>
<P>
(i)  Operating profit is stated before goodwill amortisation and
integration costs which are shown separately on the face of the
profit and loss account.
</P>
<P>
(ii) Integration costs comprise expenditure incurred in respect of cost
reduction and revenue enhancement targets set in connection with the
acquisition of NatWest and costs of integrating the regional retail
and commercial banking operations acquired from Mellon Financial
Corporation in December 2001, together with expenditure incurred on
the related cost reduction and revenue enhancement targets.

Year ended 31 December 2001 compared with the year ended 31 December 2000 - pro
forma basis
</P>
<P>
The Group has performed strongly in 2001, driven by higher income and
improvements in efficiency in each of its businesses. Good progress continues
to be made on the integration of NatWest; revenue enhancements and cost
reductions are now expected to be higher than the initial plan.

<P>
<SPAN STYLE="font-weight: bold">
Profit
</SPAN>
</P>
<P>
Profit before tax, goodwill amortisation and integration costs at (pound)5,801
million was up 32%, (pound)1,400 million, from (pound)4,401 million. Profit
before tax at (pound)4,275 million increased by 28% from (pound)3,327 million
after charging integration costs of (pound)875 million compared with (pound)434
million in 2000. All businesses contributed to this improvement.
</P>
<P>
Total income
</P>
<P>
Total income rose by 18%, (pound)2,223 million, to (pound)14,581 million.
Strong growth was achieved across all businesses.
</P>
<P>
Net interest income
</P>
<P>
Net interest income increased by 16%, (pound)940 million, to (pound)6,869
million underpinned by good growth in both corporate and personal lending and
deposits. Average interest-earning assets of the Group's banking business
increased by 11%, including 14% growth in average loans and advances to
customers.
</P>
<P>
Net interest margin of the banking business improved from 3.0% to 3.1%.
Improved lending spread together with the benefit of income from the proceeds
of the market placing of ordinary shares in July 2001, prior to deployment in
December 2001 in the Mellon acquisition, contributed to this improvement and
more than offset a small decrease in deposit margins.

Overview of results - pro forma basis (continued)
</P>
<P>
Non-interest income
</P>
<P>
Non-interest income, which represents 53% of total income, grew by 16%,
<BR>
(pound)887 million, to (pound)6,337 million, excluding general insurance. Fees
and commissions receivable were up 16%, (pound)656 million, to (pound)4,735
million, with strong growth in lending related fees, cards and merchant
acquiring and in money transmission fees. Dealing profits were up (pound)295
million, 26% ahead of the prior year as a result of strong growth in customer
activity levels and favourable market conditions. This additional dealing
income contributed approximately (pound)160 million to the Group's profits.
</P>
<P>
General insurance premium income, after reinsurance, increased by 40%,
<BR>
(pound)396 million, to (pound)1,375 million, reflecting strong volume growth in
Direct Line and branch based insurance.
</P>
<P>
Total expenses
</P>
<P>
Operating expenses, excluding goodwill amortisation and integration costs, rose
by 3%, (pound)227 million, to (pound)6,841 million, with increased integration
benefits from the NatWest acquisition largely offsetting increases due to
inflation, business development and customer service improvement initiatives.
</P>
<P>
General insurance claims, after reinsurance, increased by 36%, (pound)250
million, to (pound)948 million in line with volume growth.
</P>
<P>
The number of staff employed in the Group rose by 11,700, 12% to 105,700. The
increase reflects approximately 5,000 staff in businesses acquired in the year,
as well as additional staff to support the strong growth in business levels and
to deliver enhanced customer service in the branch networks. The total also
includes short-term appointments in connection with the integration of NatWest.
</P>
<P>
Cost:income ratio
</P>
<P>
The Group's focus on income growth along with tight control of costs and the
benefits of integration have driven the cost:income ratio down from 53.5% to
46.9%.
</P>
<P>
Credit quality and provisions
</P>
<P>
The Group's lending portfolio is widely diversified and, based on internal
grading systems, the composition of the portfolio is broadly unchanged. Overall
credit quality remains strong.
</P>
<P>
New provisions were up 27%, (pound)230 million to (pound)1,071 million. This
increase reflects the growth in lending and the deterioration in the short-term
economic outlook combined with the impact of a small number of specific
customer situations. Recoveries of amounts previously written off were down
<BR>
(pound)116 million, 59% to (pound)80 million. Consequently the net charge to
the profit and loss account was up from (pound)645 million to (pound)991
million.
</P>
<P>
Total balance sheet provisions for bad and doubtful debts amounted to
<BR>
(pound)3,653 million (31 December 2000 - (pound)3,153 million) equivalent to
81% (31 December 2000 - 83%) of risk elements in lending.
</P>
<P>
Mellon acquisition
</P>
<P>
Citizens completed the Mellon acquisition on 1 December 2001 for a cash
consideration of US$2.2 billion ((pound)1,564 million). The goodwill arising on
this acquisition amounted to (pound)1,655 million. Integration benefits
anticipated at the time of the announcement of the acquisition have been
confirmed and the business is already making good progress.
</P>
<P>
<SPAN STYLE="font-weight: bold">
Integration
</SPAN>
</P>
<P>
Integration now comprises two elements:
</P>
<P>
<SPAN STYLE="font-weight: bold">
NatWest
</SPAN>
</P>
<P>
Integration costs were (pound)847 million compared with (pound)434 million in
2000. Good progress continues to be made in integrating NatWest. Implementation
has been faster which has resulted in revenue benefits and cost savings being
achieved ahead of plan. In addition to value being created earlier than
planned, additional revenue benefits and cost savings have been identified
which are expected to result in combined annual benefits being (pound)300
million more than plan giving a benefit of (pound)2.0 billion per annum at the
end of the programme.
</P>
<P>
As a consequence of the accelerated implementation and the additional benefits,
the cumulative profits from the integration programme to the end of 2003 are
expected to be (pound)5.5 billion. This is (pound)1.4 billion greater than the
planned (pound)4.1 billion and the overall cost of the programme is now
estimated to be (pound)2.3 billion against a plan of (pound)1.4 billion.
</P>
<P>
<SPAN STYLE="font-weight: bold">
Mellon
</SPAN>
</P>
<P>
Mellon was acquired in December 2001 and expenditure of (pound)28 million was
incurred in the early stages of integrating Mellon with Citizens. No benefits
from this integration have yet been recognised.

<P>
Net interest income increased by 16%, (pound)940 million, to (pound)6,869
million underpinned by good growth in both corporate and personal lending and
deposits. Average interest-earning assets of the Group's banking business
increased by 11%, including 16% growth in average loans and advances to
customers.
</P>
<P>
Net interest margin of the banking business improved from 3.0% to 3.1%.
Improved lending spread together with the benefit of income from the proceeds
of the market placing of ordinary shares in July 2001, prior to deployment in
the Mellon acquisition, contributed to this improvement and more than offset a
small decrease in deposit margins.

<P>
Year ended 31 December 2000 compared with the year ended 31 December 1999
</P>
<P>
Net interest income increased by 12%, (pound)655 million, to (pound)5,929
million. Average interest earning assets of the Group's banking business
increased by 11%, (pound)19.0 billion, to (pound)197.7 billion. Within this,
average loans and advances to customers were up 21%, (pound)22.4 billion, at
<BR>
(pound)129.6 billion due to growth in both corporate and personal lending.
</P>
<P>
Interest spread declined 0.1% to 2.3%. Narrower margins in mortgages and cards,
together with the run-off of higher yielding assets were only partially offset
by improvements in Citizens.
</P>
<P>
The increase in net interest-free funds, up 25%, (pound)5.3 billion, to
<BR>
(pound)26.7 billion, and higher interest rates offset the decline in interest
spread, leaving the net interest margin of the banking business unchanged at
3.0%.

Analysis of change in net interest income - pro forma basis
</P>
<P>
The following table allocates changes in net interest income between volume and
rate for the year ended 31 December 2001 compared with the year ended 31
December 2000 and the year ended 31 December 2000 compared with the year ended
31 December 1999. Volume and rate variances have been calculated based on
movements in average balances over the period and changes in interest rates on
average interest-earning assets and average interest-bearing liabilities.
Changes due to a combination of volume and rate are allocated pro rata to
volume and rate movements.

Operating expenses, excluding goodwill amortisation and integration costs, rose

The number of staff employed in the Group rose by 11,700, 12% to 105,700. The
increase reflects approximately 5,000 staff in businesses acquired in the year,

<P>
Integration costs were (pound)847 million compared with (pound)434 million in
2000. Good progress continues to be made in integrating NatWest. Implementation
has been faster which has resulted in revenue benefits and cost savings being
achieved ahead of plan. In addition to value being created earlier than
planned, additional revenue benefits and cost savings have been identified
which are expected to result in combined annual benefits being (pound)300
million more than plan giving a benefit of (pound)2.0 billion per annum at the
end of the programme.
</P>
<P>
As a consequence of the accelerated implementation and the additional benefits,
the cumulative profits from the integration programme to the end of 2003 are
expected to be (pound)5.5 billion. This is (pound)1.4 billion greater than the
planned (pound)4.1 billion and the overall cost of the programme is now
estimated to be (pound)2.3 billion against a plan of (pound)1.4 billion.

Mellon was acquired in December 2001 and expenditure of (pound)28 million was
incurred in the early stages of integrating Mellon with Citizens. No benefits

The acquisition of NatWest had a significant effect on the Group's financial
position. In order to provide additional relevant and meaningful financial
information, pro forma results for the years ended 31 December 2000 and 31
December 1999 have been prepared on the assumption that NatWest was acquired on
1 January 1999.

The following table sets forth the contribution of each division to profit
before goodwill amortisation and integration costs for the year ended 31
December 2001 compared with the years ended 31 December 2000 and 31 December
1999 on a pro forma basis.

(pound)3,011 million.

<P>
Total income was up 16%, (pound)755 million to (pound)5,404 million. Net
interest income was up 17%, (pound)307 million to (pound)2,100 million,
primarily due to lending growth in Corporate Banking and also as a result of
the benefits of favourable market conditions in Financial Markets. Average
loans and advances to customers of the banking business increased by 14%,
<BR>
(pound)9.5 billion to (pound)76.6 billion, predominantly in Corporate Banking,
both in the UK and overseas.
</P>
<P>
Non-interest income was up 16%, (pound)448 million to (pound)3,304 million
reflecting growth in customer advances, payment and transmission related fees
and dealing profits.
</P>
<P>
Direct expenses were up 12%, (pound)203 million to (pound)1,899 million. Staff
costs increased by 12%, (pound)121 million, mainly due to performance related
payments reflecting higher income in Financial Markets. Other expenses,
excluding operating lease depreciation, were 16%, (pound)49 million higher
reflecting increased business volumes, infrastructure costs supporting European
expansion and acquisitions. The direct cost:income ratio improved from 36.5% to
35.1%.
</P>
<P>
Provisions were up (pound)271 million to (pound)494 million. The increase
reflects growth in lending, the global economic slowdown, a small number of
specific customer situations and lower recoveries, partially offset by a
reduction in amounts written off investments.

<P>
Total income was up 5%, (pound)228 million to (pound)4,649 million. Net
interest income was up 2%, (pound)35 million to (pound)1,793 million. In the
first half of 1999, NatWest Financial Markets benefited from favourable market
conditions. Adjusting for this, underlying net interest income increased by 8%.
</P>
<P>
Non-interest income was up 7%, (pound)193 million, to (pound)2,856 million
reflecting higher volumes, increased corporate activity and the benefits of the
enlarged customer base. Specialist businesses such as Leveraged Finance,
Structured Finance and Asset Finance, which provide innovative and
sophisticated products to meet customers' business requirements, grew strongly.
Within non-interest income, net fee income was up 8%, and dealing profits were
11% higher.
</P>
<P>
Direct expenses were down (pound)25 million to (pound)1,696 million, primarily
due to lower staff costs. The direct cost:income ratio improved from 38.9% to
36.5%.
</P>
<P>
Provisions were up 7%, (pound)14 million, to (pound)223 million. Amounts
written off fixed investments were (pound)43 million (1999: (pound)16 million),
reflecting a restructuring of the development capital investment portfolio.
This was partially offset by lower bad and doubtful debts which were down 7%, 13
million to (pound)180 million, compared to 1999 when a small number of
large provisions were taken.

Group Technology costs reduced by 13%, (pound)91 million to (pound)632 million
reflecting lower staff costs and the benefits of de-duplication initiatives.
Expenditure in Customer Support and other operations was up (pound)18 million,
4% to (pound)469 million due to volume growth in lending and account management
and costs associated with customer service enhancement initiatives.
</P>

Average staff numbers fell by 12%. Integration savings offset a rise in work

Total manufacturing costs of (pound)1,660 million, were 11%, (pound)206 million
lower. The reduction reflects improved efficiency and the positive effects of
integrating RBS and NatWest operations resulting in lower expenditure in a
number of areas. In particular, technology costs were down 22%, (pound)204
million as a consequence of the integration initiatives. The programme to
centralise all back-office work out of NatWest branches in England and Wales
was completed five months earlier than planned by NatWest. Rationalisation of

Total income was up 5%, (pound)45 million to (pound)933 million. Net interest
income grew by 9%, (pound)39 million to (pound)464 million. This was largely

Profit before goodwill amortisation was up 35%, (pound)91 million to (pound)349
million. Of the increase, the acquisition of the commercial banking business of
State Street in October 1999 and UST Corp. in January 2000 contributed an
estimated (pound)50 million after funding costs of (pound)40m. Excluding the
acquisitions, strong organic growth and the strengthening of the US dollar
relative to sterling resulted in an increase in profit before goodwill
amortisation of 16%, (pound)41 million.
</P>
<P>
Net interest income rose by 55%, (pound)236 million, to (pound)667 million due
to organic loan and deposit growth and the acquisitions which added some
<BR>
(pound)160 million after funding costs. Non-interest income was up 70%,
<BR>
(pound)102 million to (pound)247 million reflecting the acquisitions, which
contributed approximately (pound)50 million, and expansion of product lines
especially in commercial areas. Expenses at (pound)525 million were 74%,
<BR>
(pound)224 million higher, due to the acquisitions, which added an estimated
<BR>
(pound)150 million, and business expansion. Provisions for bad and doubtful
debts were (pound)40 million, including (pound)10 million relating to the
acquisitions, compared with (pound)17 million in 1999 reflecting the increased
level of loans.
</P>
<P>
The increase in the cost:income ratio from 52.3% to 57.4% reflects the effect
of the funding costs associated with the acquisitions together with higher
long-term performance linked bonuses.

The loss before goodwill amortisation and integration costs reduced by
<BR>
(pound)201 million to (pound)463 million.
</P>
<P>
Funding costs at (pound)188 million were down 13%, (pound)29 million. The
current year benefited from the proceeds of the share placing in July 2001
prior to deployment in the Mellon acquisition, contributing (pound)35 million.
</P>
<P>
Central department costs at (pound)192 million declined (pound)29 million, 13%,
due mainly to the benefit of integration initiatives. Other corporate items,
which included certain one-off items in both years, reduced by 63%, (pound)143

Overview - summary consolidated balance sheet
</P>
<P>
Total assets of (pound)368.8 billion at 31 December 2001 were up (pound)48.8
billion, 15%, in the year, reflecting business growth and the Mellon
acquisition.
</P>
<P>
Cash and balances at central banks and items in the course of collection were
up (pound)0.4 billion, 6%, at (pound)6.4 billion.
</P>
<P>
Treasury bills and other eligible bills increased by (pound)6.8 billion to
<BR>
(pound)10.1 billion, reflecting liquidity management.
</P>
<P>
Loans and advances to banks rose (pound)6.5 billion, 20% to (pound)38.5 billion
reflecting increased reverse repurchase agreements and stock borrowing
(&quot;reverse repos&quot;), up (pound)7.2 billion, 68%, to (pound)17.7 billion, due to a
switch from customer reverse repos and certificates of deposits (&quot;CDs&quot;)
marginally offset by a decline in bank placings, down (pound)0.7 billion, 3% to
<BR>
(pound)20.8 billion.
</P>
<P>
Loans and advances to customers were up (pound)22.4 billion, 13% to
<BR>
(pound)190.5 billion. Excluding reverse repos, lending increased by (pound)24.5
billion, 16%, to (pound)178.9 billion reflecting growth across all divisions.
The Mellon acquisition contributed (pound)4.4 billion to the increase. Reverse
repos declined by 15%, (pound)2.1 billion to (pound)11.6 billion following a
switch to bank reverse repos.
</P>
<P>
Debt securities and equity shares increased (pound)6.3 billion, 11% to
<BR>
(pound)65.6 billion. Growth of (pound)7.0 billion in Citizens, of which
<BR>
(pound)4.1 billion related to the Mellon acquisition, and Wealth Management, up
<BR>
(pound)1.7 billion, has been partially offset by a switch from CDs to reverse
repos.
</P>
<P>
Intangible fixed assets increased by (pound)1.2 billion, 10% to (pound)13.3
billion, principally reflecting the goodwill on the Mellon acquisition,
amounting to (pound)1,655 million, partially offset by the charge for goodwill
amortisation.
</P>
<P>
Other assets rose by (pound)5.7 billion, 20% to (pound)34.1 billion, mainly due
to increased settlement balances, up (pound)4.2 billion, due to increased
trading activity in 2001 and growth in tangible fixed assets, up (pound)2.7
billion as a result of structured finance investment property transactions and
growth in operating lease assets.
</P>
<P>
Deposits by banks increased by (pound)4.9 billion, 14%, to (pound)40.0 billion.
Repurchase agreements and stock lending (&quot;repos&quot;) were up (pound)4.0 billion,
61%, to (pound)10.4 billion due to a switch from customer repos; inter-bank
deposits were up (pound)0.9 billion.
</P>
<P>
Customer accounts were up (pound)21.7 billion, 12%, at (pound)199.0 billion.
Excluding repos, deposits rose (pound)24.0 billion, 15%, to (pound)181.5
billion with growth across all divisions. The Mellon acquisition contributed
<BR>
(pound)10.1 billion to this increase. Repos declined by (pound)2.3 billion, 11%
to (pound)17.5 billion, mainly as a result of a switch to bank repos.
</P>
<P>
Debt securities in issue were up (pound)11.3 billion, 58%, at (pound)30.7
billion primarily to meet the Group's funding requirements.
</P>
<P>
Other liabilities increased by (pound)5.1 billion, 12% to (pound)46.8 billion
mainly reflecting higher settlement balances, up (pound)3.6 billion, and short
positions, up (pound)1.8 billion partially offset by a decrease in the
mark-to-market value of derivatives.
</P>
<P>
Subordinated liabilities were up (pound)1.3 billion, 12% to (pound)11.7
billion. New euro, sterling and US dollar denominated issues of (pound)1.9
billion were partly offset by maturing US dollar and sterling denominated loan
capital.
</P>
<P>
Shareholders' funds were up (pound)4.5 billion, 19% to (pound)27.6 billion
principally due to retentions of (pound)0.8 billion and the issue of (pound)3.1
billion of equity and non-equity shares. In July 2001, 140 million new ordinary
shares were issued through a market placing to fund the Mellon acquisition
raising (pound)2.1 billion before expenses. In addition, the Group issued
<BR>
(pound)0.3 billion US dollar denominated preference shares and (pound)0.8
billion US dollar denominated perpetual regulatory tier one securities in June
2001 and August 2001 respectively. The issue of new ordinary shares in
respect of the exercise of share options and in lieu of dividends added
<BR>
(pound)0.4 billion to shareholders' funds.

The Group's loan control and review procedures do not include the
classification of loans as non-accrual, accruing past due, restructured and
potential problem loans, as defined by the SEC. The following table shows the
estimated amount of loans which would be reported using the SEC's
classifications. The figures incorporate estimates and are stated before
deducting the value of security held or related provisions.

The figures at 31 December 1999 are on a pro forma basis.
</P>
<P>
Notes:
<BR>
(1)  The Group's UK banking subsidiary undertakings account for loans on a
non-accrual basis only from the point in time at which the collectability
of interest is in significant doubt. Certain subsidiary undertakings of
the Company generally account for loans on a non-accrual basis when
interest or principal is past due 90 days.
<BR>
(2)  NatWest Home Loans Limited includes in this category the total value of
loans which are subject to claims under Mortgage Guarantee Insurance
policies in force.
<BR>
(3)  Overdrafts generally have no fixed repayment schedule and consequently are
not included in this category.
</P>
<P>
Loans that are current as to payment of principal and interest and not
reflected in the above table, but in respect of which management has serious
doubts as to the ability of the borrower to comply with contractual repayment
terms, totalled approximately (pound)1,080 million at 31 December 2001
((pound)772 million at 31 December 2000). Substantial security is held in
respect of these loans and appropriate provisions have already been made in
accordance with the Group's provisioning policy for bad and doubtful debts.
</P>
<P>
The classification of a loan as non-accrual, past due 90 days or troubled debt
restructuring does not necessarily indicate that the principal of the loan is
uncollectable in whole or in part as this depends in each case on the
individual circumstances of the loan, including the adequacy of any collateral
securing the loan. Therefore, classification of a loan as non-accrual, past due
90 days or troubled debt restructuring does not always require that a provision
be made against such a loan. In accordance with the Group's provisioning policy
for bad and doubtful debts, it is considered that adequate provisions for the
above risk elements in lending have been made in the financial statements.

Notes to the derivation of unaudited pro forma consolidated profit and loss
account
</P>
<P>
The pro forma consolidated profit and loss accounts above incorporate the
effect of the following:
</P>
<P>
1.   They include the results of NatWest from 1 January 1999 and assume that
the fair value adjustments were made on 31 December 1998.
</P>
<P>
2.   Goodwill arising on the acquisition of NatWest, of (pound)11,483 million,
has been amortised over its estimated economic life of 20 years from 1
January 1999 resulting in goodwill amortisation of (pound)574 million per
annum.
</P>
<P>
Goodwill arising on other acquisitions made by the Group after 1 January
1999 has been amortised from the effective dates of acquisition, generally
also over 20 years. Goodwill arising on acquisitions prior to 1 January
1999 was written off directly to reserves and has not been reinstated, as
permitted by FRS 10.
</P>
<P>
3.   A surplus of (pound)1,070 million in NatWest Pension Funds has been
amortised, from 1 January 1999, over the estimated average remaining
service life of members of the schemes. The adjustment has been reflected
in 'Staff costs'.
</P>
<P>
4.   An adjustment has been made to reflect the net funding of the acquisition
of NatWest as if acquired on 1 January 1999. The net funding comprises
cash paid and loan notes issued to NatWest shareholders of (pound)7,349
million and fees and expenses relating to the acquisition of (pound)176
million less net proceeds of (pound)3,910 million from the issue of new
ordinary and preference shares and (pound)20 million of proceeds from the
exercise of options over NatWest ordinary shares. The adjustment impacts
'Interest payable' and 'Preference dividends'.
</P>
<P>
5.   The results of businesses disposed of since 1 January 1999 and the profit
arising on their sale have been excluded from the pro forma accounts. The
principal disposals were RBS Trust Bank, Gartmore and the venture capital
investments of NatWest. The dis-aggregation of the profits of these
businesses are reflected across all captions, except minority interests
and preference dividends, in the pro forma consolidated profit and loss
account. A funding adjustment, impacting 'Interest payable', has been made
to recognise the benefit of estimated net proceeds assuming that these
funds were received on 1 January 1999.
</P>
<P>
6.   All expenditure incurred to integrate the Group's existing operations with
those of NatWest and relating to projects and initiatives to achieve the
cost reduction and income enhancement targets set in connection with the
acquisition of NatWest have been eliminated from 'Operating expenses' and
shown separately under the caption 'Integration costs'.
</P>
<P>
7.   Preference dividends of NatWest represent minority interests in the Group.
</P>
<P>
8.   Bid defence costs incurred by NatWest, during the years ended 31 December
1999 and 2000, have been excluded from the pro forma consolidated profit
and loss account.

9.   Reconciliation between UK and US GAAP - pro forma basis
</P>
<P>
The pro forma consolidated profit and loss accounts are prepared in
accordance with UK GAAP which differs in certain respects from US GAAP;
the differences in accounting principles are set out in Note 52 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements. The differences are summarised as

Loan portfolio
</P>
<P>
The Group's loan portfolio consists of loans (including overdraft facilities)
and instalment credit and finance lease receivables. Overdraft facilities
provide the customer with a demand deposit account and demand credit facility
combined in a single checking (current) account. An overdraft is effected
whenever a customer's drawings on a demand deposit account exceed the credit
balance of the account, the balance of which may alternate between debit and
credit. While overdrafts are contractually repayable on demand unless a fixed
term has been agreed, in practice customers will from time to time make
deposits into the account, thereby reducing indebtedness or increasing a credit
balance in accordance with their business requirements. Borrowing limits on the
overdraft facility are established, and full repayment is required only if the
customer fails to honour the conditions on which the limit was granted or his
financial position has so deteriorated that it is necessary to take protective
action. Overdraft facilities are usually reviewed at least annually. Interest
is generally calculated on the daily outstanding balance by reference to the
Group's base rate and is typically charged monthly. Overdrafts accounted for
approximately 12.6% of the Group's total domestic loan portfolio at 31 December
2001 (31 December 2000 - 11.0%; 30 September 1999 - 10.8%).

Lending concentrations
</P>
<P>
One of the principal factors influencing the quality of the Group's earnings is
the diversification of its loan portfolio by geographical area within the UK,
by industry classification and by individual customer. The spread of the
Group's assets reduces concentration of risk.
</P>
<P>
The Group's exposure to risk from its lending is widely diversified both
geographically and by industry. With the exception of lending for home mortgages
and other personal loans in the UK, there were no loan concentrations in any
individual sector or industry which exceeded 10% of total loans to customers
(before provisions). Instalment credit loans and direct finance leases are
largely conducted through the consumer and industrial finance businesses of
Lombard North Central PLC.

Provisions for bad and doubtful debts
</P>
<P>
Provisioning policy
</P>
<P>
The Group's approach to managing credit risk is discussed under 'Credit risk'
on page 118 and its accounting policy for loans and advances is set out on page
<BR>
138. The Group establishes bad and doubtful debt provisions so as to record
loans and advances at their expected ultimate net realisable value.
</P>
<P>
Specific provisions are made against loans when, as a result of reviews of the
loan portfolios, it is considered that recovery is doubtful. Each portfolio is
considered and monitored separately using a variety of systems, reports and
models.
</P>
<P>
Homogeneous portfolios, including credit card receivables and mortgages, make
up a significant proportion of the Group's loans. Provisions on these
portfolios are calculated using a formulaic approach based on number of days in
arrears and the predicted risk of loss on the loan.
</P>
<P>
For other portfolios, counterparties are assigned a credit grading which is
mapped onto the Group scale. Credit grades are reviewed at least annually.
Where deterioration is detected the credit is downgraded as appropriate. If it
is determined that more intensive management is required, the credit is passed
to a specialist unit. Specific provision is made where a review of the advance
reveals that the creditworthiness of the borrower has undergone a significant
deterioration and that recovery of the advance is in significant doubt taking
account of available security. This review will also consider the cancellation
or reduction of unutilised limits, appointment of an investigating accountant
and other mitigating actions. The amount of the specific provision will
reflect:
</P>
<P>
o the financial condition of the borrower
<BR>
o the realisable value of any security
<BR>
o the costs of recovery or realisation of security
</P>
<P>
The Group establishes a general provision through charges to the profit and loss
account to cover losses that have not been specifically identified but are
known from experience to be present in any portfolio of loans. The level of
general provision reflects the size and diversity of the Group's loan
portfolio, past experience, the current state of the economies in which the
Group operates and the scope of specific provisioning procedures.
</P>
<P>
Bad and doubtful debt provisions made during the year (less amounts released
and recoveries of amounts written-off in previous years) are charged against
income. Where the collectibility of interest is in doubt it is not credited to
the profit and loss account but to a suspense account. Loans classified as bad
debts and any related suspended interest are written-down to their estimated
net realisable value when it is identified that there is no realistic prospect
of recovery of all or part of the loan.
</P>
<P>
There are differences between the provisioning policies of banks in the UK and
the US. In the UK, loans and related accrued interest are written-off only
when, as a matter of banking judgement, there is no realistic prospect of
recovery. When management determines that a write-off is appropriate, the
principal amount and accrued interest on the obligation are written down to
estimated net realisable value. Interest receivable on loans is recognised as
income as it accrues provided that its collectibility is not subject to
significant doubt. In contrast, banks in the US typically cease accruing
interest when loans become overdue by 90 days and recovery is doubtful, and
write-off loans earlier. The effect of this difference is that the Group's
gross lendings, its provisions for bad and doubtful debts and provision cover
ratios are greater than would be the case using US practice.

<P>
Notes:
<BR>
(1)  The Group's UK banking subsidiary undertakings account for loans on a
non-accrual basis only from the point in time at which the collectability
of interest is in significant doubt. Certain subsidiary undertakings of
the Company generally account for loans on a non-accrual basis when
interest or principal is past due 90 days.
<BR>
(2)  NatWest Home Loans Limited includes in this category the total value of
loans which are subject to claims under Mortgage Guarantee Insurance
policies in force.
<BR>
(3)  Overdrafts generally have no fixed repayment schedule and consequently
are not included in this category.
</P>
<P>
Loans that are current as to payment of principal and interest and not
reflected in the above table, but in respect of which management has serious
doubts as to the ability of the borrower to comply with contractual repayment
terms, totalled approximately (pound)1,080 million at 31 December 2001 (31
December 2000 - (pound)772 million). Of this amount, (pound)801 million related
to domestic loans and (pound)279 million to foreign loans (31 December 2000 -
<BR>
(pound)699 million to domestic loans and (pound)73 million to foreign loans).
Substantial security is held in respect of these loans and appropriate
provisions have already been made in accordance with the Group's provisioning
policy for bad and doubtful debts.
</P>
<P>
The classification of a loan as non-accrual, past due 90 days or troubled debt
restructuring does not necessarily indicate that the principal of the loan is
uncollectable in whole or in part as this depends in each case on the
individual circumstances of the loan, including the adequacy of any collateral
securing the loan. Therefore, classification of a loan as non-accrual, past due
90 days or troubled debt restructuring does not always require that a provision
be made against such a loan. In accordance with the Group's provisioning policy
for bad and doubtful debts, it is considered that adequate provisions for the
above risk elements in lending have been made in the financial statements.
Total provisions for bad and doubtful debts as a percentage of gross loans and
advances to customers was 1.88% at 31 December 2001, up from 1.83% at 31
December 2000, principally due to new provisions exceeding the amounts
written-off in the year.
</P>
<P>
Gross interest income not recognised, but which would have been recognised
under the original terms of the non-accrual and restructured loans, amounted to
<BR>
(pound)173 million for the year ended 31 December 2001 (year ended 31 December
2000 - (pound)148 million; year ended 30 September 1999 - (pound)53 million)
from domestic loans and (pound)60 million for the year ended 31 December 2001
(year ended 31 December 2000 - (pound)48 million; year ended 30 September 1999
<BR>
- (pound)32 million) from foreign loans. Interest on non-accrual and
restructured loans included in net interest income was (pound)42 million for
the year ended 31 December 2001 (year ended 31 December 2000 - (pound)30
million; year ended 30 September 1999 - (pound)4 million) from domestic loans
and (pound)14 million for the year ended 31 December 2001 (year ended 31
December 2000 - (pound)8 million; year ended 30 September 1999 - (pound)13
million) from foreign loans.

A substantial portion of the Group's assets are funded by deposits, principally
current accounts and various types of interest bearing deposit accounts,
collected through the UK branch networks of RBS and NatWest, and through
Citizens and Wealth Management. The remainder of the assets of the Group are
funded by wholesale deposits, debt securities in issue, loan capital and
shareholders' equity.
</P>
<P>
At 31 December 2001, 31 December 2000 and 30 September 1999, approximately
15.3%, 16.5% and 8.9% respectively, of domestic deposits were in non-interest
bearing current accounts and approximately 46.0%, 42.9% and 57.8% respectively,
of domestic deposits were interest bearing deposits repayable on demand.
Interest bearing demand deposits are current accounts with credit balances and
retail deposits repayable on demand, obtained primarily through the UK branch
networks, and wholesale deposits repayable on demand, booked mainly within the
Group's treasury operations. Interest rates applicable to such deposits are
generally calculated on the basis of a margin under base rate. Deposits in
currencies other than sterling are collected principally by Corporate Banking
and Financial Markets, Citizens and Wealth Management. The former raises most
of its deposits through the wholesale markets whereas Citizens' and Wealth
Management's deposits are principally demand and savings deposits.
</P>
<P>
Savings deposits are specific products which are designed to attract larger
savings from personal customers who do not require withdrawals on demand and
therefore in general offer better rates of return than interest bearing demand
deposits. At 31 December 2001, 31 December 2000 and 30 September 1999,
approximately 9.6%, 11.0% and 7.5% respectively, of domestic deposits were in
savings deposits.
</P>
<P>
Other time deposits are collected centrally from the money market to bridge the
gap between retail resources and sterling assets. Chief sources of wholesale
deposits are the inter-bank market, corporations and non-bank financial
institutions which place funds on the inter-bank market, and issuance of
certificates of deposit and medium term notes. All are priced in relation to
money market rates. Rate considerations and the ability to provide funds in the
maturity periods required by RBS and NatWest to fulfil their liquidity
management objectives affect the choice of instrument. Customers are offered
rates related to inter-bank market rates for the term of the deposit depending
on the amounts and term. Larger deposits (typically (pound)1 million and over)
earn the money market rates paid in the inter-bank market, and smaller amounts
earn progressively wider spreads under the money market rate. Rates are
centrally communicated throughout the Group by the central treasury operation.
While competitive rates influence the quantity of deposits obtained through the
branch network, the branch network enables a wide variety of local depositor
sources to be accessed.

Average interest rates during the period are computed by dividing total
interest expense by the average amount borrowed. Average interest rates at
period end are average rates for a single day and as such may reflect one-day
market distortions which may not be indicative of generally prevailing rates.
Original maturities of commercial paper are not in excess of nine months.
'Other short-term borrowings' consist principally of borrowings in the money
markets included within 'Deposits by banks' and 'Customer accounts' in the
Consolidated Financial Statements, and generally have original maturities of
one year or less.

<P>
It is the Group's policy to maintain a strong capital base and to allocate its
capital resources efficiently. The Group seeks to diversify its sources of
capital and to optimise its mix. In carrying out this policy, due regard is
given to ensuring a prudent relationship exists between the capital base and
the underlying risks of the business.
</P>
<P>
The Group manages its capital within the FSA's supervisory framework and those
of local supervisors in the various jurisdictions in which the Group operates.
The FSA requires each UK bank within the Group, and the consolidated Group, to
maintain a minimum level of regulatory capital when compared with the
underlying risks of the business. This relationship is measured by the Risk
Asset Ratio (&quot;RAR&quot;), one of the FSA's key supervisory tools. The RAR is
calculated by comparing a bank's capital resources with its weighted risk
assets. In determining weighted risk assets, the Group's banking operations are
classified as either trading book or banking book. In measuring banking book
weighted risk assets, assets and off balance sheet exposures are assigned a
risk weighting according to the nature of the asset or exposure and the
counterparty. Trading book weighted risk assets reflect market and counterparty
risk.
</P>
<P>
Total regulatory capital is made up of three classes (&quot;tiers&quot;). Tier 1 capital
mainly comprises equity shareholders' funds, certain preference shares and
perpetual regulatory securities. Goodwill is deducted from tier 1 capital. Tier
2 capital includes perpetual, medium-term and long-term subordinated debt,
general provisions for bad and doubtful debts and fixed asset revaluation
reserves. Tier 3 capital is made up of short-term subordinated debt with a
minimum original maturity of two years. Tier 3 capital can only support trading
activities and is not eligible to support counterparty or settlement risk,
whilst tier 1 and tier 2 capital support both trading and banking activities.
The aggregate of tier 2 and 3 capital may not exceed tier 1 capital.
Investments in those subsidiary and associated undertakings that are not
consolidated for regulatory purposes and investments in the capital of other
financial institutions are deducted from total capital.
</P>
<P>
At 31 December 2001, the Group's capital ratios comfortably exceeded
internationally agreed minimums. Total RAR ratio was 11.5% (31 December 2000 -
11.5%) and the tier 1 ratio was 7.1% (31 December 2000 - 6.9%).

Special purpose vehicles
</P>
<P>
Special purpose vehicles (&quot;SPVs&quot;) are vehicles set up for a specific, limited
purpose that do not carry out a business or trade and typically have no
employees. They take a variety of legal forms - trusts, partnerships and
companies - and fulfil many different functions. They constitute a key element
of securitisation transactions in which an SPV acquires financial assets funded
by the issue of securities.
</P>
<P>
UK GAAP for SPVs is covered by the consolidation rules in the UK Companies Act
and FRS 2 'Accounting for Subsidiary Undertakings' and by the provisions
relating to 'quasi subsidiaries' in FRS 5 'Reporting the Substance of
Transactions'. The Companies Act and FRS 2 govern the preparation of
consolidated financial statements and define those entities - subsidiaries -
that should be included. The definition of subsidiary is based principally on
control either through a majority of voting rights or through control of the
board of directors. FRS 5 introduced the concept of a 'quasi subsidiary' - a
company, trust, partnership or other vehicle that, though not fulfilling the
definition of a subsidiary, is directly or indirectly controlled by the
reporting entity and gives rise to benefits no different from those that would
arise were the vehicle a subsidiary. FRS 5 requires such entities to be
consolidated in the same way as conventional subsidiaries.
</P>
<P>
In the normal course of business, the Group arranges securitisations to
facilitate client transactions and undertakes securitisations to sell financial
assets or to obtain funding. SPVs are also utilised in its fund management
activities to structure investment funds to which the Group provides investment
management services.
</P>
<P>
The Group has established a number of SPVs to act as commercial paper conduits
for customers. These vehicles acquire financial assets from these customers
funded by the issue of commercial paper. The Group has no interest in the
assets held in these vehicles which are not subsidiaries and are not
consolidated in the Group's financial statements. The Group undertakes certain
administrative duties for, and provides liquidity facilities to, these vehicles
on an arm's length basis.

TREND INFORMATION
</SPAN>
</P>
<P>
The financial services sector is likely to remain competitive with increasing
numbers of providers of financial services and alternative distribution
channels.
</P>
<P>
Following a review of banking services in the UK, the Government announced that
banking services to small and medium sized enterprises (&quot;SMEs&quot;) would be the
subject of a Competition Commission (&quot;CC&quot;) enquiry. In March 2001, the CC
published its provisional findings that a number of banks in the UK, including
RBSG, are part of two complex monopolies. It also published a list of
hypothetical remedies. In October 2001, the CC delivered its final report to
the Department of Trade and Industry and Her Majesty's Treasury, which at that
stage remained confidential.
</P>
<P>
On 14 March 2002, the Government published the CC's report. The report stated
that the CC had found that a number of specific practices of the four largest
clearing bank groups (including RBSG) restricted or distorted price
competition. In the CC's view, this resulted in those clearing bank groups
charging excessive prices to SMEs in England and Wales to an extent that would
not be found in a fully competitive situation. In addition, it concluded that
there are other adverse effects across the entire UK arising from the level of
choice and the level of information available to SMEs arising from the practice
of the eight main clearing bank groups in the UK.
</P>
<P>
The CC recommended a number of measures to apply to all eight main clearing
bank groups to increase competition and reduce barriers to entry and expansion.
These remedies included measures to enhance the ease with which SMEs may switch
banks, measures limiting the bundling of services and proposals to improve
customer information and transparency. In addition the CC recommended an
examination into the scope for the sharing of branches. The CC also suggested
other measures for inclusion in the industry code published by the British
Bankers' Association on 6 March 2002.
</P>
<P>
The CC further concluded that although these measures would act, along with
technological and other developments, to improve competition over the longer
term the effect of these measures over the coming two to three years would be
limited. In order to eliminate what the CC perceived to be excessive prices
being charged to SMEs, the CC also recommended that the four largest clearing
bank groups be required to pay interest on SME current accounts in England and
Wales at Bank of England base rate less 2.5 per cent. Alternatively, the four
largest clearing bank groups could offer SMEs current accounts which are free
of money transmission charges or a choice between the two. The CC recommended
that three years after implementation of these remedies the Director General of
Fair Trading should review whether further measures are necessary or whether
any or all of the measures can be modified or discontinued.
</P>
<P>
The Government announced that it accepted the recommendations made by the CC in
full. There will now be a period of consultation between the main clearing bank
groups and the Office of Fair Trading to determine the means and timing of the
implementation of the remedies, which the CC suggests should be completed
within six months of the publication of its report. The Group is currently
analysing the implications of the report.

o    Remuneration arrangements will be designed to support the Company's
business strategy, to promote appropriate teamwork and to conform to best
practice standards.
</P>
<P>
Components of remuneration
</P>
<P>
The policy aims to deliver an appropriate balance between long-term incentives,
short-term incentives and fixed elements of reward.
</P>
<P>
Performance rewards - long-term
</P>
<P>
Options. Executive share options focus on absolute share price growth supported
by the delivery of underlying financial performance. Options are typically
allocated to UK-based executives over one times salary worth of shares each
year. The options are not exercisable unless the growth in the Company's
earnings per share over three years has exceeded the growth in the Retail Price
Index plus 9%, as measured from the higher of the earnings per share in the
year before the options were granted and the earnings per share in the relevant
base year if the performance condition is rolled forward. The condition is
reviewed annually.
</P>
<P>
Medium-term plan. UK-based executives are eligible to receive awards under the
medium-term performance plan in the form of share or share equivalent awards.
This plan is targeted at the most senior group of executives and focuses on
achieving superior returns for shareholders compared with other leading
financial organisations. Performance is measured over three years using total
shareholder return (&quot;TSR&quot;). Awards under this plan will not vest if TSR is
below the median of the comparator group or if annualised earnings per share
growth is less that the annualised growth of the Retail Price Index plus 3%.
Awards will be set at a competitive level within the overall limit of one and a
half times earnings. Details of individual awards during the year to 31
December 2001 are set out in the table below and did not exceed 150% of basic
salary of any of the participants.
</P>
<P>
Performance rewards - short-term
</P>
<P>
Annual bonus. This typically focuses from year to year on the delivery of a
balanced scorecard of appropriate Group and individual, financial and
operational targets approved by the Remuneration Committee. Individual
executives have a maximum annual bonus potential ranging from 60% to 100% of
salary although for exceptional performance, as measured by the achievement of
significant objectives, bonuses of up to 200% of salary may be awarded.
</P>
<P>
Fixed elements
</P>
<P>
Salary. Salaries are reviewed annually as part of total remuneration having
regard for remuneration paid to executives of comparable companies. The
Remuneration Committee uses a range of survey data from leading consultancies
and reaches individual salary decisions taking account of the remuneration
environment and the performance and responsibilities of the individual
director.
</P>
<P>
Pensions. UK-based executives are eligible for defined benefit pensions in
accordance with the terms of the relevant pension scheme. Individual
arrangements beyond the Inland Revenue limits are detailed below.
</P>

</DIV>
<HR CLASS="eolPageBreak">
<DIV CLASS="eolNewPage"></DIV>
<A NAME="eolPage93"></A>
<P>
Benefits and other share schemes. Executives are eligible to receive benefits
including the provision of a company car, medical health insurance,
death-in-service benefits and beneficial loans on similar terms to other
employees. In addition, UK-based executives are eligible to participate in
Group-wide plans including option 2000, sharesave and the Group profit sharing
schemes.
</P>
<P>
US-based executives
</P>
<P>
Separate salary review processes and pension provisions operate in the US
reflecting the remuneration practice in that country. Separate incentive
arrangements also operate for US-based executives. They are based on similar
principles to executive incentives in the UK but are designed to be competitive
in the US market and focus on relevant key business objectives for the US
businesses.
</P>
<P>
For executives of Citizens, long-term performance rewards take two forms:
</P>
<P>
The Phantom 2000 plan, approved by shareholders in 2000, provides a cash based
proxy for share options. Under the plan, units are granted on a regular basis
and can normally be exercised four or five years from grant, at which point a
cash amount equal to the difference in the unit price between grant and
exercise is paid. The price of a unit is calculated by reference to Citizens'
cumulative economic profit and the growth in economic profit, adjusted to
reflect changes in the price/earnings ratio of a group of banks. No individual
participant can be awarded more than 20% of the maximum total units available
under the plan. Payments under the plan are subject to both a minimum
performance target and a maximum total payout cap. Details of awards to Mr Fish
during the year are set out in the table on page 94.
</P>
<P>
A cash based long-term incentive plan rewards the achievement of three year
financial targets. The maximum award available under the plan is 105% of
salary.
</P>
<P>
Short-term performance rewards take the form of a discretionary annual bonus
which rewards the achievement of Group, business unit and individual financial
and non-financial targets. Following an independent review of executive
compensation practice in the US, the maximum annual bonus potential has been
increased to 200% of salary.
</P>
<P>
Directors' pension arrangements
</P>
<P>
During the year, Viscount Younger, Mr Goodwin, Mr Robertson, Mr McLuskie and Mr
Watt participated in The Royal Bank of Scotland Staff Pension Scheme (&quot;the RBS
Scheme&quot;). Mr Pell participated in the National Westminster Bank Pension Fund
(&quot;the NatWest Scheme&quot;). The RBS Scheme and the NatWest Scheme are defined
benefit schemes which provide pensions and other benefits within Inland Revenue
limits. Viscount Younger was provided with life assurance benefits only under
the RBS Scheme until his retirement as Chairman on 11 April 2001; these were
restricted by Inland Revenue limits as set out in the Finance Act 1989.
Additional life assurance cover, in excess of that provided by the RBS Scheme,
was secured under separate arrangements. Provision for his pension entitlement
is made under a personal pension contract, which is a defined contribution
arrangement, and an unfunded defined benefit arrangement. In the case of Mr
Robertson, his pension entitlement under the RBS Scheme is restricted by Inland
Revenue limits as set out in the Finance Act 1989; additional life assurance
cover in excess of these limits is provided by a separate arrangement. Mr
Goodwin's and Mr Watt's entitlements under the RBS Scheme, and Mr Pell's
entitlement under the NatWest Scheme are similarly restricted by Inland Revenue
limits as set out in the Finance Act 1989. Arrangements have been made to
provide Mr Goodwin, Mr Watt and Mr Pell with additional pension benefits and
life assurance cover outwith the Schemes. The figures in the table below
include the accrual in respect of these arrangements. Mr Fish accrues pension
benefits under a number of arrangements in the US. Defined benefits are built
up under the Citizens' Qualified Plan, Excess Plan and Employee Arrangement. In
addition, he is a member of two defined contribution arrangements - a Qualified
<BR>
401(K) Plan and Executive Supplemental Benefit Plan. The London Stock Exchange
requires a disclosure of director's pension entitlement on the basis of the
Institute and Faculty of Actuaries' recommendations. The tables below provide
information on both defined benefit and defined contribution arrangements.

BOARD PRACTICES
</SPAN>
</P>
<P>
The Board has overall responsibility for leading and controlling the Company
and is accountable to shareholders for financial and operational performance.
</P>
<P>
The Board has adopted a formal schedule of matters detailing key aspects of the
Company's affairs presented to it for decision. In particular, the Board is
responsible for approving policy and strategy. Responsibility for the
development of policy and strategy and operational management is delegated to
the Group Chief Executive and executive directors.
</P>
<P>
The roles of Chairman and Group Chief Executive are distinct and separate, with
clearly divided responsibilities. The vice-chairmen perform the role of senior
non-executives. The non-executive directors combine broad business and
commercial experience with independent and objective judgement. The balance
enables the Board to provide clear and effective leadership and maintain the
highest standards of integrity across the Company's business activities. The
Board has reviewed the independence of the non-executive directors and has
reaffirmed that, with the exception of Mr Botin and Mr Inciarte who are
representatives of Santander Central Hispano, S.A., all non-executive directors
are considered by the Board to be independent.
</P>
<P>
The Board normally meets monthly and is supplied with comprehensive Board
papers in advance of each Board meeting including financial and business
reports covering each of the Company's principal business activities. Following
the appointment of Sir George Mathewson as Chairman, a review was carried out
to assess the Board's effectiveness, and as a consequence of that review, a
number of enhancements to the Board process have been introduced.
</P>
<P>
All directors have access to the advice and services of the secretary who is
responsible for ensuring that the Board procedures and all applicable rules and
regulations are observed. In addition, all directors are able, if necessary, to
obtain independent professional advice at the Company's expense.
</P>
<P>
Board committees
</P>
<P>
In order to provide effective oversight and leadership the Board has
established a number of committees with particular responsibilities. The
principal committees are as follows:
</P>
<P>
the Audit Committee is responsible for assisting the Board to discharge its
responsibilities for accounting policies, financial reporting, internal
control, compliance and risk management.
</P>
<P>
the Remuneration Committee is responsible for considering and making
recommendations to the Board on the Company's executive remuneration policy,
the remuneration arrangements of directors and senior executives and the
operation of the Company's employee share schemes. No director is involved in
deciding his own remuneration.
</P>
<P>
the Nominations Committee is responsible for assisting the Board in the formal
selection and appointment of directors.
</P>
<P>
Terms of office of directors
</P>
<P>
At each annual general meeting of shareholders of the Company, the terms of
office of directors appointed since the previous annual general meeting,
together with the terms of one-third by rotation of the remaining directors,
expire.

<P>
Service agreements
</P>
<P>
The Remuneration Committee has adopted a policy that directors will not
normally be given a contract term greater than 12 months. If it is necessary to
provide a longer term when recruiting an individual, the contract will revert
to 12 months in due course. Existing contract terms will remain in place.
Details of individual contract terms are set out below.
</P>
<P>
Mr Fish's employment agreement with Citizens is terminable on 24 months notice
by Citizens and 12 months notice by Mr Fish.
</P>
<P>
The service agreement of Mr Goodwin is terminable on 12 months notice by RBS
and six months notice by Mr Goodwin.
</P>
<P>
The service agreement of Mr McLuskie is terminable on three months notice by
RBS and three months notice by Mr McLuskie.
</P>
<P>
Mr Pell was appointed by NatWest with effect from 1 February 2000 and has a
service agreement which is terminable by NatWest on 24 months notice for the
first two years of employment, decreasing on a monthly basis to 12 months
notice after three years employment. The service agreement is terminable on six
months' notice by Mr Pell.
</P>
<P>
The service agreement of Mr Robertson is terminable on 12 months notice by RBS
and six months notice by Mr Robertson.
</P>
<P>
The service agreement of Mr Watt is terminable on 12 months notice by RBS and
six months notice by Mr Watt.
</P>
<P>
The Board of directors and the Remuneration Committee considers the relevant
notice periods noted above to be in the best interests of the Company and its
shareholders. These enable the Company to retain executive directors of the
highest calibre and maintain management continuity.

<P>
The number of staff employed by the Group rose by 11,700, 12%, to 105,700 at 31
December 2001. The increase reflects approximately 5,000 staff in businesses
acquired in the year, as well as additional staff to support the growth in
business levels and to deliver enhanced customer service in the branch
networks. The total also includes short-term appointments in connection with
the integration of NatWest.
</P>
<P>
Staff numbers at 31 December 2000 fell by 7,300 (9,000 excluding the impact of
businesses acquired) compared to 94,000 at 31 December 1999.

<P>
Staff involvement
</P>
<P>
The Group encourages employee involvement through a process of communication
and consultation. This involves internal communications activities, team
meetings led by line managers and regular dialogue with employees and employee
representatives.
</P>
<P>
The annual, Group-wide, employee opinion survey forms an integral part of the
manner in which the Group communicates and consults with employees. In 2001,
the Group recorded its highest ever response rate with 75% of employees
completing and returning their survey either on paper or, for the first time,
online. As well as representing an impressive 8% increase from the 2000 survey,
the response rate is significantly higher than the average for large corporate
organisations.
</P>
<P>
This survey and other employee communication procedures enable the Group to
identify and address key issues and to focus its efforts in line with the
aspirations and expectations of its people.
</P>
<P>
It is the Group's intention to launch a European Works Council in 2002 to
facilitate discussion amongst representatives on employment matters of a
transnational nature affecting more than one European member state.
</P>
<P>
Involvement in the Group's performance is encouraged by providing employees
with the opportunity to acquire shares in the Company through profit sharing
and sharesave schemes.
</P>
<P>
Equal opportunities
</P>
<P>
The Group continually strives for improvement of its equal opportunities and
has strengthened its commitment in 2001. We have established a Group Policy
which states:
</P>
<P>
The Group is committed to valuing and promoting diversity and equal opportunity
in all areas of recruitment, employment, training and promotion. The Group will
work towards an environment that is based on meritocracy and inclusiveness,
where all employees can develop their full potential, irrespective of their
race, gender, marital status, age, disability, religious belief, political
opinion or sexual orientation.
</P>
<P>
The Group's active support is also expressed through its membership of forums
such as Opportunity Now, Race for Opportunity, the Employers' Forum on
Disability and the Employers' Forum on Age.
</P>
<P>
<SPAN STYLE="font-weight: bold">
Disability
</SPAN>
</P>
<P>
The Group recognises its responsibility towards disabled employees and the
wealth of talent and skills possessed by disabled people. The Group will comply
with the relevant legislation and wherever possible seek to exceed the minimum
standards.
</P>
<P>
The views of our disabled employees are also sought through our annual employee
opinion survey, allowing us to recognise and meet their requirements.
</P>
<P>
Health and safety
</P>
<P>
The health, safety, welfare and security of staff are of paramount importance
to the Group. The health and safety policy has been revised to take account of
changes in the Group's corporate structure and the recently introduced guidance
from the Health and Safety Commission on the responsibility of directors for
health and safety.
</P>
<P>
Currently, a systematic review of health and safety policies and procedures is
being undertaken to ensure that a consistent approach is taken across the
Group. An important part of this process is the Group's involvement in the UK
Health and Safety Executive's Lead Authority Partnership Scheme. This scheme is
recognised by all UK local authorities, which enforce health and safety
standards. The Group participates in a similar scheme with the local fire
brigades, who enforce fire safety legislation.

ITEM 10. ADDITIONAL INFORMATION
</SPAN>
</P>
<P>
<SPAN STYLE="font-weight: bold">
MEMORANDUM AND ARTICLES OF ASSOCIATION
</SPAN>
</P>
<P>
The following information is a summary of certain terms of the Company's
Memorandum of Association (the &quot;Memorandum&quot;) and Articles of Association (the
&quot;Articles&quot;) as in effect at the date of this Annual Report and certain relevant
provisions of the Companies Act 1985, as amended (the &quot;Act&quot;) as relevant to the
holders of any class of share. The following summary description is qualified
in its entirety by reference to the terms and provisions of the Memorandum and
Articles. The Memorandum and Articles are registered with the Registrar of
Companies of Scotland. Holders of any class of share are encouraged to read the
full Memorandum and Articles, which have been filed with the SEC.
</P>
<P>
Incorporation and registration
</P>
<P>
The Company was incorporated and registered in Scotland under the Companies Act
1948 to 1967 as a limited company on 25 March 1968 under the name National and
Commercial Banking Group Limited. On 10 March 1982, it changed its name to its
present name and was reregistered under the Companies Act 1948 to 1980 as a
public company with limited liability. The Company is registered under Company
No. SC 45551.
</P>
<P>
Purpose and objects
</P>
<P>
The Memorandum provides, amongst other things, that its objects are to carry on
the business of banking in all or any of its aspects and to carry on the
business of a holding company. The Company's objects are set out in full in
clause 4 of the Memorandum.
</P>
<P>
<SPAN STYLE="font-weight: bold">
Directors
</SPAN>
</P>
<P>
At each annual general meeting of the Company, one third of the directors (or
the number nearest to one third) subject to retirement will retire by rotation
and be eligible for re-election. The directors to retire will be those who have
been longest in office since their last appointment or reappointment or, in the
case of those who were appointed or reappointed on the same day, will (unless
they otherwise agree) be determined by lot.
</P>
<P>
Directors may be appointed by the Company by ordinary resolution or by the
board. A director appointed by the board holds office only until the next
annual general meeting, whereupon he will be eligible for re-election, and is
not taken into account in determining the directors who are to retire by
rotation at that meeting. Unless and until otherwise determined by ordinary
resolution, the directors (other than alternative directors) shall be not more
than twenty five. There is no stipulation in the Articles regarding a minimum
number of directors; under the Act, and in the absence of express provision,
the minimum number is two.
</P>
<P>
Directors' interests
</P>
<P>
A director shall not vote at a meeting of the board or a committee of the board
on any resolution of the board concerning a matter in which he has an interest
(otherwise than by virtue of his interest in shares, debentures or other
securities of, or otherwise in or through, the Company) which (together with
any interest of any person connected with him) is, to his knowledge, material
unless his interest arises only because the resolution relates to one or more
of the following matters:
</P>
<P>
(i)    the giving of any security or indemnity in respect of money lent, or
obligations incurred by him or any other person at the request of, or
for the benefit of, the Company or any of its subsidiary undertakings;
</P>
<P>
(ii)   the giving of any security or indemnity to a third party in respect of a
debt or obligation of the Company or any of its subsidiary undertakings
for which he has assumed responsibility (in whole or in part) under a
guarantee or indemnity or by the giving of security;
</P>
<P>
(iii)  a proposal concerning an offer of shares, debentures or other securities
of the Company, or any of its subsidiary undertakings, for subscription
or purchase, in which offer he is, or may be, entitled to participate as
a holder of securities or in the underwriting or sub-underwriting of
which he is to participate;
</P>
<P>
(iv)   a contract, arrangement, transaction or proposal concerning any other
body corporate in which he is interested, directly or indirectly,
whether as an officer or shareholder or otherwise, provided that he is
not the holder of shares representing one per cent. or more of any class
of the equity share capital of such body corporate;
</P>
<P>
(v)    any proposal concerning the adoption, modification or operation of a
pension fund or retirement, death or disability benefits scheme or
employees' share scheme which relates both to directors and employees of
the Company or a subsidiary of the Company and does not provide any
privilege in respect of any director which it does not accord to the
employees to which the fund or scheme relates;
</P>
<P>
(vi)   a contract, arrangement, transaction or proposal for the benefit of the
employees of the Company or any of its subsidiary undertakings which
does not award him any privilege or benefit not generally accorded to
the employees to whom the arrangement relates; and
</P>
<P>
(vii)  a contract, arrangement, transaction or proposal concerning any
insurance which the Company proposes to purchase and/or maintain for, or
for the benefit of, any directors or for persons who include directors
of the Company.

<P>
Borrowing powers
</P>
<P>
The directors may exercise all the powers of the Company to borrow money and to
mortgage or charge its undertaking, property and uncalled capital and to issue
debentures and other securities, whether outright or as collateral security for
any debt, liability or obligation of the Company, or of any third party.
</P>
<P>
<SPAN STYLE="font-weight: bold">
Retirement
</SPAN>
</P>
<P>
In accordance with section 293 of the Act and the Articles, no person who has
attained the age of 70 may be appointed to the board and any serving director
reaching that age must vacate his office at the conclusion of the annual
general meeting commencing next after he or she attains the age of 70.
</P>
<P>
Notwithstanding the foregoing, directors of any age may be appointed to or
remain on the board if that appointment is or was made or approved by the
Company in a general meeting provided that special notice containing the age of
the relevant director is given.
</P>
<P>
Qualifying shareholding
</P>
<P>
Directors are not required to hold any shares of the Company by way of
qualification.
</P>
<P>
Classes of shares
</P>
<P>
The Company has 4 general classes of shares, including ordinary shares,
preference shares, additional value shares and non-voting deferred shares to
which the provisions set forth below apply.
</P>
<P>
<SPAN STYLE="font-weight: bold">
Dividends
</SPAN>
</P>
<P>
<SPAN STYLE="font-weight: bold">
General
</SPAN>
</P>
<P>
Subject to the provisions of the Act and clause 133 of the Articles, the
Company may, by ordinary resolution, declare dividends on ordinary shares save
that no dividend shall exceed the amount recommended by the board.
</P>
<P>
Any dividend which has remained unclaimed for 12 years from the date when it
became due for payment shall, if the board so resolves, be forfeited and shall
revert to the Company. The Company may cease sending dividend warrants and
cheques by post or otherwise to a member if such instruments have been returned
undelivered to, or left uncashed by, that member on at least two consecutive
occasions, or, following one such occasion, reasonable enquiries have failed to
establish any new address or account of the registered holder. The Company may
resume sending warrants and cheques if the holder requests such recommencement
in writing.
</P>
<P>
Preference shares
</P>
<P>
Each cumulative preference share confers the right to a fixed cumulative
preferential dividend payable half-yearly. Each non-cumulative preference share
confers the right to a preferential dividend (not exceeding a specified amount)
payable in the currency of the relevant share. The rate of such dividend and
the date of payment thereof, together with the terms and conditions of the
dividend are as may be determined by the directors prior to allotment.
Cumulative preference share dividends are paid in priority to any dividend on
any other class of share.
</P>
<P>
The non-cumulative preference shares rank for dividend after the cumulative
preference shares but rank pari passu with each other and any shares expressed
to rank, in terms of participation in the profits of the Company, in some or
all respects pari passu therewith and otherwise in priority to dividends
payable on the ordinary shares and any other share capital in the Company.
</P>
<P>
Dividends will be declared and paid in full on non-cumulative preference shares
if, in the opinion of the directors of the Company, the Company has sufficient
distributable profits, after payment in full or the setting aside of a sum to
provide for all dividends accrued on the cumulative preference shares, to cover
such payment in full.
</P>
<P>
If, in the opinion of the directors, insufficient profits of the Company are
available to cover the payment in full of dividends after having paid any
dividends payable on any of the cumulative preference shares, dividends will be
declared by the directors pro rata on the non-cumulative preference shares to
the extent of the available distributable profits.
</P>
<P>
The non-cumulative preference shares will carry no further rights to
participate in the profits of the Company and if, and to the extent that, any
dividend or part of any dividend is on any occasion not paid for the reasons
described above, holders of non-cumulative preference shares will have no claim
in respect of such non-payment.
</P>
<P>
If any dividend is not payable for the reasons described above, or if payment
of any dividend would cause a breach of the UK Financial Services Authority's
capital adequacy requirements applicable to the Company or its subsidiaries,
the directors may pay a special dividend not exceeding US$0.01, (pound)0.01 or
<BR>
(euro)0.01 (depending on the currency of the relevant preference share) per
share.
</P>
<DIV CLASS="eolCenter">
106
</DIV>
<HR CLASS="eolPageBreak">
<DIV CLASS="eolNewPage"></DIV>
<A NAME="eolPage108"></A>
<P>
If the dividend payable on any series of non-cumulative preference shares on
the most recent payment date is not paid in full, or if a sum is not set aside
to provide for such payment in full, no dividends may be declared on any other
share capital of the Company other than the cumulative preference shares and no
sum may be set aside for the payment of a dividend on any other share capital,
unless, on the date of declaration, an amount equal to the dividend payable in
respect of the then current dividend period for such series of non-cumulative
preference shares is set aside for payment in full on the next dividend payment
date.
</P>
<P>
If any dividend payable on the non-cumulative preference shares is not paid in
full or if a sum is not set aside to provide for such payment in full, the
Company may not redeem or purchase or otherwise acquire any other share capital
of the Company and may not set aside any sum nor establish any sinking fund for
its redemption, purchase or other such acquisition, until such time as
dividends have been declared and paid in full in respect of successive dividend
periods together aggregating not less than twelve months.
</P>
<P>
Additional Value Shares (&quot;AVS&quot;)
</P>
<P>

1986 and subject to the rights attaching to any class of shares after payment
of all liabilities, including the payment to holders of preference shares,

In the event of a return of capital on a winding-up or otherwise, the holders

including the amount of any dividend due for a payment after the date of
commencement of any winding-up or liquidation but which is payable in respect
of a half-year period ending on or before such date and (ii) pari passu with

Non-cumulative preference shares and convertible preference shares
</P>
<P>
Subject to the Act, the Company may purchase any non-cumulative preference
shares and convertible preference shares upon such terms as the directors shall
determine provided that, where the shares being purchased are listed on the
London Stock Exchange, the purchase price payable, exclusive of expenses and
accrued dividends, shall not exceed (a) in the case of a purchase in the open
market, or by tender, the average of the closing middle market quotations of
such shares for the 10 dealing days preceding the date of the purchase or (if
higher), in the case of a purchase in the open market only, the market price on
the date of purchase provided that such market price is not more than 105 per
cent. of such average and (b) in the case of a purchase by private treaty, 120
per cent. of the closing middle market quotation of such shares for the last
dealing day preceding the date of purchase; but so that this proviso shall not
apply to any purchase of such shares made in the ordinary course of a business
of dealing in securities. Upon the purchase of any such shares, the nominal
amount of such shares shall thereafter be divided into, and reclassified as,
ordinary shares.
</P>
<P>
Conversion rights
</P>
<P>
Convertible preference shares carry the right to convert into ordinary shares
if they have not been the subject of a notice of redemption from the Company,
on or before a specified date determined by the directors. The right to convert
will be exercisable by service of a conversion notice on the Company within a
specified period. The Company will use reasonable endeavours to arrange the
sale, on behalf of convertible preference shareholders who have submitted a
conversion notice, of the ordinary shares which result from such conversion and
to pay to them the proceeds of such sale so that they receive net proceeds
equal to the nominal value of the convertible preference shares which were the
subject of the conversion notice and any premium at which such shares were
issued, provided that ordinary shares will not be sold at below a benchmark
price (as determined prior to the issue of the relevant convertible preference
shares by the directors).
</P>
<P>
The Category II non-cumulative convertible sterling shares carry the right to
convert into ordinary shares on three conversion dates and, if they have not
been converted or redeemed prior to 31 March 2003, they will automatically
convert into ordinary shares on that date. The details of the terms of the
Category II non-cumulative convertible sterling preference shares are set out
in Schedule 3 to the Articles.
</P>
<P>
Following the payment of aggregate dividends of (pound)1 in respect of each
additional value share, the additional value shares will be de-listed from the
Official List and from trading on the London Stock Exchange's market for listed
securities and will convert automatically into non-voting deferred shares of
<BR>
(pound)0.01 each. Non-voting deferred shares shall be utilised for the limited
purpose of the conversion of additional value shares. No non-voting deferred
shares are in issue at this date. A description of non-voting deferred shares
is found in clause 2.6 of Schedule 4 to the Articles.
</P>
<P>
If, on 1 September 2003, aggregate dividends of (pound)1 have not been paid in
respect of each additional value share, then unless the Directors have resolved
that a dividend be paid on or before the final dividend date of such amount
that aggregate dividends paid on each additional value share will be (pound)1
and that dividend is duly paid on or before the final dividend date as
described under clause 2.7 of Schedule 4 to the Articles, the additional value
shares will be converted into fully paid up ordinary shares and the Company
will use its reasonable efforts, to the extent permitted by applicable law, to
sell such ordinary shares to raise sale proceeds equivalent to an amount per
additional value share of (pound)1 less the aggregate amount of any dividends
paid in respect of each such additional value share. The conversion into
Ordinary Shares is subject to the conditions as described in clauses 2.6 and
2.7 of Schedule 4 to the Articles.

Changes in share capital and variation of rights

Subject to the provisions of the Act and without prejudice to any rights
attached to any existing shares or class of shares, any share may be issued
with such rights or restrictions as the Company may by ordinary resolution
determine or, subject to and in default of such determination, as the board
shall determine. Subject to the provisions of the Act, the Company may issue
shares which are, or at the option of the Company or the holder are liable, to
be redeemed. Subject to the provisions of the Act and the Articles, unissued
shares are at the disposal of the board.
</P>
<P>
The Company may by ordinary resolution: increase its share capital; consolidate
and divide all or any of its share capital into shares of larger amount than
its existing shares; subject to the provisions of the Act, subdivide its
shares, or any of them, into shares of smaller amount than is fixed by the
Memorandum; or cancel any shares which have not been taken or agreed to be
taken by any person and diminish the amount of its share capital by the amount
of the shares so cancelled.
</P>
<P>
Subject to the provisions of the Act, if at any time the capital of the Company
is divided into different classes of shares, the rights attached to any class
of shares may (unless further conditions are provided by the terms of issue of
the shares of that class) be varied or abrogated, whether or not the Company is
being wound up, either with the consent in writing of the holders of
three-quarters in nominal value of the issued shares of the class or with the
sanction of an extraordinary resolution passed at a separate general meeting of
holders of the shares of the class (but not otherwise).

The rights attaching to any class of shares having preferential rights are not,

participation in the profits or assets of the Company, pari passu therewith,

Disclosure of interests in shares

The Act gives the Company the power to require persons who it believes to be,
or have been within the previous three years, interested in its shares, to
disclose prescribed particulars of those interests. Failure to supply the
information or supplying a statement which is materially false may lead to the
board imposing restrictions upon the relevant shares. The restrictions
available are the suspension of voting or other rights conferred by membership
in relation to meetings of the Company in respect of the relevant shares and,
additionally, in the case of a shareholding representing at least 0.25 per
cent. of the class of shares concerned, the withholding of payment of dividends
on, and the restriction of transfers of, the relevant shares.

unpaid on shares and may forfeit shares on which calls payable are not duly
paid. The forfeiture shall include all dividends payable in respect of the
forfeited shares which have not been paid before the forfeiture.

<P>
(iii)    during the period referred to in sub-paragraph (i) above and the

TAXATION
</SPAN>
</P>
<P>
The following discussion summarises certain US federal and UK tax consequences
of the acquisition, ownership and disposition of non-cumulative dollar
preference shares, ADSs, X-CAPs or PROs by a beneficial owner of non-cumulative
dollar preference shares, ADSs evidenced by ADRs, X-CAPs or PROs that is a
citizen or resident of the United States or that otherwise will be subject to
US federal income tax on a net income basis in respect of the non-cumulative
dollar preference shares, X-CAPs, ADSs or PROs (a &quot;US Holder&quot;). This summary
assumes that a US Holder is holding non-cumulative dollar preference shares,
ADSs evidenced by ADRs, X-CAPs or PROs, as applicable, as capital assets. This
summary does not address the tax consequences to a US Holder (i) that is
resident (or, in the case of an individual, ordinarily resident) in the UK for
UK tax purposes or, generally, (ii) that is a corporation which alone or
together with one or more associated companies, controls, directly or
indirectly, 10% or more of the voting stock of the Company.
</P>
<P>
The statements regarding US and UK tax laws (including the US/UK double
taxation convention relating to income and capital gains) (the &quot;Treaty&quot;) and
the US/UK double taxation convention relating to estate and gift taxes (the
&quot;Estate Tax Treaty&quot;) and practices set forth below are based (i) on those laws
and practices as in force and as applied in practice on the date of this
Report, (ii) in part, on the new double taxation convention relating to income
and capital gains signed by the US and the UK (the &quot;New Treaty&quot;), which must be
ratified by the US Senate and the UK Parliament before its provisions enter
into force, although no assurance can be provided as to when the New Treaty
will enter into force, and (iii) in part, on representations of the depository,
and assume that each obligation in the Deposit Agreement and any related
agreement will be performed in accordance with its terms. The US Treasury has
expressed concerns that parties to whom ADRs are pre-released may be taking
actions that are inconsistent with the claiming, by US Holders of ADRs, of
foreign tax credits for US federal income tax purposes. Accordingly, the
analysis of the creditability of UK taxes described below could be affected by
future actions that may be taken by the US Treasury. The terms of the New
Treaty are currently awaiting ratification by the US and UK governments; the
final provisions of this treaty might alter the rules described in this
discussion. This summary is not exhaustive of all possible tax considerations
and holders are advised to satisfy themselves as to the overall tax
consequences, including specifically the consequences under US federal, state,
local and other laws, of the acquisition, ownership and disposition of
non-cumulative dollar preference shares, ADSs evidenced by ADRs, X-CAPs or PROs
by consulting their own tax advisers.
</P>
<P>
For the purposes of the New Treaty and the Estate Tax Treaty and for purposes
of the US Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the &quot;Code&quot;), US Holders of
ADSs will be treated as owners of the non-cumulative dollar preference shares
underlying such ADSs.

Preference shares or ADSs evidenced by ADRs

<P>
Taxation of dividends
</P>
<P>
The Company is not required to withhold tax at source from dividend payments it
makes or from any amount (including any amounts in respect of accrued
dividends) distributed by the Company.
</P>
<P>
When the Company pays a dividend, an amount equal to 10/90ths of the amount of
the cash dividend is generally allowed as a credit (the &quot;Tax Credit&quot;) against
the UK tax liability of individuals who receive (or who are treated as
receiving) the dividend and who are resident in the UK for UK tax purposes.
</P>
<P>
Under the Treaty, an Eligible US Holder (as defined below) is entitled to a
payment from the United Kingdom of the

<DIV CLASS="eolCenter">

<HR CLASS="eolPageBreak">
<DIV CLASS="eolNewPage"></DIV>
<A NAME="eolPage113"></A>
<P>
Tax Credit to which an individual resident in the UK for UK tax purposes would
have been entitled (the &quot;Tax Credit Amount&quot;). Such payment will be subject to a
deduction withheld of an amount not exceeding 15% of the sum of the cash
dividend and the Tax Credit Amount (the &quot;UK Withholding Tax&quot;), but not in
excess of the Tax Credit Amount. Accordingly, Eligible US Holders will not
receive any actual payment since the UK Withholding Tax will cancel out the Tax
Credit Amount. In addition, Eligible US Holders will have no further UK tax
liability in respect of the dividend.
</P>
<P>
For the purposes of this Report, the term 'Eligible US Holder' means a US
Holder that is a beneficial owner of a non-cumulative dollar preference share
or an ADS evidenced by an ADR and of the cash dividend paid thereon, and that
satisfies the following conditions: the US Holder (i) is an individual or a
corporation resident in the United States for purposes of the Treaty (and, in
the case of a corporation, is not also resident in the UK for UK tax purposes);
<BR>
(ii) is not a corporation which, alone or together with one or more associated
corporations, controls, directly or indirectly, 10% or more of the voting stock
of the Company; (iii) whose holding of the non-cumulative dollar preference
shares or ADSs is not effectively connected with a permanent establishment in
the UK through which such US Holder carries on business or with a fixed base in
the UK from which such US Holder performs independent personal services; (iv)
under certain circumstances, is not an investment or holding company, 25% or
more of the capital of which is owned, directly or indirectly, by persons that
are not individuals resident in, and are not nationals of, the United States;
<BR>
(v) under certain circumstances, is not exempt from federal income tax on
dividend income in the United States; and (vi) under certain circumstances,
does not own 10% or more of the series of non-cumulative dollar preference
shares in respect of which the dividend is paid.
</P>
<P>
A US Holder that is a trust or estate may be entitled to the benefit of the
Treaty in respect of a cash dividend paid by the Company but only to the extent
that dividend income derived by such US Holder is taxable in the United States
as the income of a US resident in the hands of such US Holder or of its
beneficiaries, as the case may be.
</P>
<P>
Cash distributions, including any UK tax withheld therefrom, made with respect
to the non-cumulative dollar preference shares or ADSs representing preference
shares will constitute dividends for US federal income tax purposes to the
extent paid out of current or accumulated earnings and profits of the Company,
as determined for US federal income tax purposes.
</P>
<P>
A US Holder will realise dividend income for US federal income tax purposes in
an amount equal to the sum of any cash dividend paid by the Company and, if
such Holder is an Eligible US Holder that elects under the Treaty to claim a
foreign tax credit with respect to the UK Withholding Tax, the UK Withholding
Tax associated with such cash dividend. Dividends paid by the Company will not
be eligible for the dividends received deduction allowed to corporations under
the Code.
</P>
<P>
Subject to certain limitations and restrictions, the UK Withholding Tax
withheld in accordance with the Treaty will be treated for US tax purposes as a
UK withholding tax that may be claimed as a credit against the US federal
income tax liability of the Eligible US Holder who complies with applicable
filing requirements and so elects under the Treaty. The limitation on foreign
taxes eligible for credit is calculated separately with respect to specific
classes of income. For this purpose, dividends paid by the Company with respect
to the non-cumulative dollar preference shares will generally constitute
'passive income' or, in the case of certain US Holders, 'financial services
income'.
</P>
<P>
The election described in the preceding paragraph will not be available under
the New Treaty and, accordingly, no foreign tax credit will be available under
the New Treaty with respect to dividends paid to US Holders.
</P>
<P>
Taxation of capital gains
</P>
<P>
A US Holder that is not resident (or, in the case of an individual, ordinarily
resident) in the UK will not normally be liable for UK tax on capital gains
realised on the disposition of such holder's non-cumulative dollar preference
share or ADS unless at the time of the disposal such US Holder carries on a
trade, profession or vocation in the UK through a branch or agency and such
non-cumulative dollar preference share or ADS is or has been used, held or
acquired for the purposes of such trade (or profession or vocation), branch or
agency. Special rules apply to individuals who are temporarily not resident or
ordinarily resident in the UK. A US Holder will, upon the sale, exchange or
redemption of a non-cumulative dollar preference share or ADS representing
preference shares, generally recognise capital gains or losses for US federal
income tax purposes (assuming in the case of a redemption, that such US Holder
does not own, and is not deemed to own, any ordinary shares of the Company) in
an amount equal to the difference between the amount realised (excluding in the
case of a redemption any amount treated as a dividend for US federal income tax
purposes) and the US Holder's tax basis in the non-cumulative dollar preference
share or ADS. A US Holder who is liable for both UK and US tax on a gain
recognised on the disposal of the non-cumulative dollar preference share or ADS
will generally be entitled, subject to certain limitations, to credit the UK
tax against its US federal income tax liability in respect of such gain.

Estate and gift tax
</P>
<P>
A non-cumulative dollar preference share or ADS held by an individual, whose
domicile is determined to be the United States for purposes of the Estate Tax
Treaty and who is not a national of the UK, will not be subject to UK
inheritance tax on the individual's death or on a lifetime transfer of the
non-cumulative dollar preference share or ADS, except in certain cases where
the non-cumulative dollar preference share or ADS (i) is comprised in a
settlement (unless, at the time of the settlement, the settlor was domiciled in
the United States and was not a national of the UK); (ii) is part of the
business property of a UK permanent establishment of an enterprise; or (iii)
pertains to a UK fixed base of an individual used for the performance of
independent personal services. The Estate Tax Treaty generally provides a
credit against US federal tax liability for the amount of any tax paid in the
UK in a case where the non-cumulative dollar preference share or ADS is subject
both to UK inheritance tax and to US federal estate or gift tax.
</P>
<P>
UK stamp duty and stamp duty reserve tax
</P>
<P>
The following is a summary of the UK stamp duty and stamp duty reserve tax
consequences of transferring an ADS in registered form (otherwise than to the
custodian on cancellation of the ADS). It does not set out the UK stamp duty or
stamp duty reserve tax consequences of transferring, or agreeing to transfer,
non-cumulative dollar preference shares or any interest therein or right
thereto (other than interests in ADSs) on which investors should consult their
own tax advisers.
</P>
<P>
A transfer of a registered ADS executed and retained in the US will not give
rise to stamp duty and an agreement to transfer a registered ADS will not give
rise to stamp duty reserve tax.

X-CAPs
</SPAN>
</P>
<P>
<SPAN STYLE="font-weight: bold">
United States
</SPAN>
</P>
<P>
Because the X-CAPs have no stated maturity, can be exchanged for preference
shares or ADSs at the option of the Company and would be treated as if they
were preference shares in a winding-up of the Company, and because the Company
may elect not to make payments on the X-CAPs, the X-CAPs will be treated as
equity for US federal income tax purposes.
</P>
<P>
Payments (including any UK tax withheld therefrom) will constitute foreign
source dividend income for US federal income tax purposes to the extent paid
out of the current or accumulated earnings and profits of the Company, as
determined for US federal income tax purposes. Payments will not be eligible
for the dividends received deduction allowed to corporations. For foreign tax
credit limitation purposes, payments will generally constitute 'passive
income', or in the case of certain US Holders, 'financial services income'.
</P>
<P>
A US Holder will, upon the sale, exchange or redemption of X-CAPs, generally
recognise a capital gain or loss for US federal income tax purposes in an
amount equal to the difference between the amount realised and the US Holder's
tax basis in the X-CAPs (assuming, in the case of a redemption, that such US
Holder does not own, and is not deemed to own, any ordinary shares of the
Company). A US Holder who is liable for both UK and US tax on a gain recognised
on the disposal of the X-CAPs will generally be entitled, subject to certain
limitations, to credit the UK tax against its US federal income tax liability
in respect of such gain.
</P>
<P>
Gain or loss will not be recognised by a US Holder upon the exchange of X-CAPs
for preference shares or ADSs pursuant to the Company's exercise of its
exchange right. A US Holder's basis in the preference shares or ADSs received
in exchange for its X-CAPs will be the same as the US Holder's basis in the
X-CAPs at the time of the exchange and the US Holder's holding period for the
preference shares or ADSs received in the exchange will include the holding
period of the X-CAPs exchanged.

Taxation of payments of interest
</P>
<P>
Payments of interest will not be subject to withholding or deduction for or on
account of UK taxation as long as X-CAPs are and remain at all times listed on
the New York Stock Exchange or some other 'recognised stock exchange' within
the meaning of section 841 of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988. So
long as the X-CAPs are so listed, withholding will not be required whether the
X-CAPs are in bearer or registered form. In all other cases an amount must be
withheld on account of UK income tax at the lower rate (currently 20%) subject
to any direction to the contrary by the Inland Revenue under the Treaty and
subject to any entitlement to pay gross to US Holders within the charge to
corporation tax.
</P>
<P>
Any paying agent or other person through whom interest is paid to, or by whom
interest is received on behalf of, an individual, may be required to provide
information in relation to the payment and the individual concerned to the UK
Inland Revenue. The Inland Revenue may communicate this information to the tax
authorities of other jurisdictions.

<P>
The UK Inland Revenue has confirmed that interest payments should not be
treated as distributions for UK tax purposes (i) by reason of the fact that
interest may be deferred under the terms of issue or (ii) by reason of the
undated nature of the X-CAPs, provided that at the time an interest payment is
made, the X-CAPs are not held by a company which is 'associated' with the
Company or by a 'funded company'. A company will be associated with the Company
if, broadly speaking, it is in the same group as the Company. A company will be
a 'funded company' for these purposes if there are arrangements involving that
company being put in funds (directly or indirectly) by the Company, or an
entity associated with the Company. In this respect, the Inland Revenue has
confirmed that a company holding an interest in X-CAPs which incidentally has
banking facilities with any company associated with the Company will not be a
'funded company' by virtue of such facilities.
</P>
<P>
Interest on the X-CAPs constitutes UK source income for tax purposes and, as
such, may be subject to income tax by direct assessment even where paid without
withholding. However, interest with a UK source received without deduction or
withholding on account of UK tax will not be chargeable to UK tax in the hands
of a US Holder unless that US Holder carries on a trade, profession or vocation
in the UK through a UK branch or agency in connection with which the interest
is received or to which the X-CAPs are attributable. There are exemptions for
interest received by certain categories of agent (such as some brokers and
investment managers).

<P>
Proposed EU Directive on taxation of savings income
</P>
<P>
The European Union is currently considering proposals for a new directive
regarding the taxation of savings income. Subject to a number of important
conditions being met, it is proposed that Member States of the European Union
will be required to provide to the tax authorities of another Member State
details of payments of interest or other similar income paid by a person within
its jurisdiction to or for the benefit of an individual resident in that other
Member State, subject to the right of certain Member States to opt instead for
a withholding system for a transitional period in relation to such payments.
</P>
<P>
<SPAN STYLE="font-weight: bold">
Disposal (including redemption)
</SPAN>
</P>
<P>
A disposal (including redemption) of X-CAPs by a US Holder, who is an
individual or other non corporation tax payer, will not give rise to any
liability to UK taxation on capital gains unless the US Holder carries on a
trade (which for this purpose includes a profession or vocation) in the UK
through a branch or agency and the X-CAPs are, or have been, held or acquired
for the purposes of that trade or branch or agency. However, the exchange by
such a US Holder of X-CAPs for ADSs pursuant to the Company's exercise of its
exchange right will not give rise to a charge to UK tax on capital gains.
</P>
<P>
A transfer of X-CAPs by a US Holder will not give rise to a charge to UK tax on
accrued but unpaid interest payments, unless the US Holder is an individual or
other non corporation tax payer and at any time in the relevant year of
assessment or accounting period carries on a trade in the UK through a branch
or agency to which the X-CAPs are attributable.
</P>
<P>
Annual tax charges
</P>
<P>
Corporate holders of X-CAPs may be subject to annual UK tax charges (or relief)
by reference to fluctuations in exchange rates and in respect of profits, gains
and losses arising from the X-CAPs, in place of the tax treatment referred to
in the two preceding paragraphs. These rules will not, however, apply to
corporate US Holders who do not carry on a trade, profession or vocation in the
UK through a branch or agency in the UK to which the X-CAPs are attributable.
</P>
<P>
<SPAN STYLE="font-weight: bold">
Inheritance tax
</SPAN>
</P>
<P>
X-CAPs in bearer form physically held outside the UK should not be subject to
UK inheritance tax in respect of a lifetime transfer by, or the death of, a US
Holder who is not domiciled in the UK for inheritance tax purposes. However, in
relation to X-CAPs held through DTC (or any other clearing system), the
position is not free from doubt and the Inland Revenue are known to consider
that the situs of securities held in this manner is not necessarily determined
by the place in which the securities are physically held. If X-CAPs in bearer
form are or become situated in the UK, or if X-CAPs are held in registered
form, there may be a charge to UK inheritance tax as a result of a lifetime
transfer at less than fair market value by, or on the death of, such a US
Holder. However, exemption from, or a reduction of, any such UK tax liability
may be available under the Estate Tax Treaty in the same manner as for
non-cumulative dollar preference shares.
</P>
<P>
Stamp duty and stamp duty reserve tax
</P>
<P>
No UK stamp duty is payable on the transfer by delivery or redemption of bearer
X-CAPs, whether in definitive form or in the form of one or more global X-CAPs.
No stamp duty reserve tax is payable on any agreement to transfer bearer X-CAPs
provided that the agreement is not made in contemplation of, or as part of an
arrangement for, a takeover of the Company.

<P>
No UK stamp duty will be payable in respect of any instrument of transfer of
depositary interests respectively representing X-CAPs, provided that any
instrument relating to such a transfer is not executed in the UK, and remains
at all times outside the UK. The transfer on the sale of X-CAPs in registered
form will attract ad valorem UK stamp duty or (if an unconditional agreement to
transfer X-CAPs is not completed by a duly stamped transfer) UK stamp duty
reserve tax, generally, at the rate of 0.5% of the consideration paid, which,
in the case of stamp duty, will be rounded up to (pound)5 or multiples thereof.
The transfer of X-CAPs in registered form (i) to, or to a nominee, or agent
for, a person whose business is or includes issuing depositary receipts or (ii)
to, or to a nominee for, a person whose business is or includes the provision
of clearance services, will give rise to a liability to UK stamp duty or (to
the extent that UK stamp duty is not paid on an instrument of transfer) UK
stamp duty reserve tax, generally, at the rate of 1.5% of the price of the
X-CAPs transferred, which, in the case of stamp duty, will be rounded up to
<BR>
(pound)5 or multiples thereof. Such a transfer of X-CAPs in bearer form will
give rise to a charge to UK stamp duty reserve tax, generally, at the rate of
1.5% of the price of the X-CAPs transferred. A charge to UK stamp duty reserve
tax will also arise on the issue of X-CAPs whether in registered or bearer form
<BR>
(i) to, or to a nominee or agent for, a person whose business is or includes
issuing depositary receipts or (ii) to, or to a nominee for, a person whose
business is or includes the provision of clearance services, generally at the
rate of 1.5% of the price of the X-CAPs issued.

Payments of interest on a PRO (including any UK tax withheld therefrom) will

the extent paid out of the current or accumulated earnings and profits of the
Company, as determined for US federal income tax purposes. Payments will not be
eligible for the dividends received deduction allowed to corporations. For
foreign tax credit limitation purposes, payments will generally constitute
'passive income', or in the case of certain US Holders, 'financial services
income'. A US Holder who is entitled under the Treaty to a refund of UK tax, if
any, withheld on a payment will not be entitled to claim a foreign tax credit
with respect to such tax. See 'United Kingdom - Taxation of Payments of
Interest' below for a discussion of circumstances in which UK withholding may
apply.
</P>
<P>
A US Holder will, upon the sale, exchange or redemption of a PRO, generally
recognise a capital gain or loss for US federal income tax purposes in an
amount equal to the difference between the amount realised (excluding any
amount in respect of mandatory interest and any Missed Payments (within the
meaning accorded such term by the prospectus supplement dated 13 August 2001,
filed by the Company with respect to PROs), which would be treated as ordinary
income) with respect to the PRO which are to be satisfied on a Missed Payment
Satisfaction Date (within the meaning accorded such term by such prospectus
supplement), which would be treated as ordinary income) and the US Holder's tax
basis in the PRO (assuming, in the case of a redemption, that such US Holder
does not own, and is not deemed to own, any ordinary shares of the Company). A
US Holder who is liable for both UK and US tax on a gain recognised on the

ITEM 11. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK
</SPAN>
</P>
<P>
(a) Risk management
</P>
<P>
The management of risk is fundamental to the Group's operations. It has in
place a comprehensive risk management framework comprising:
</P>
<P>
o    The Board providing leadership, setting strategy and monitoring progress.
<BR>
o    Group-wide policies, procedures, processes and systems.
<BR>
o    A comprehensive executive committee structure focusing on risk management
at Group level. Where appropriate this is replicated at divisional level.
<BR>
o    Risk management functions that are independent of business management.
</P>
<P>
The principal risk management executive committees are:
</P>
<P>
o    Group Executive Management Committee (&quot;GEMC&quot;), a sub-committee of the
Board.
<BR>
o    Group Risk Management Committee (&quot;GRMC&quot;), a sub-committee of the GEMC.
<BR>
o    Group Credit Committee (&quot;GCC&quot;), a sub-committee of the Board.
<BR>
o    Group Asset and Liability Management Committee (&quot;GALCO&quot;), a sub-committee
of GEMC.
</P>
<P>
The independent Group Risk function is responsible for advising the Board on
the operation and effectiveness of the Group's risk management framework.
Within each division, independent risk management units operate, reporting to
both divisional executive management and the Head of Group Risk. Supporting
GALCO and the Balance Sheet Management Committee, Group Treasury is responsible
for capital raising, liquidity and structural hedging policies and the
management of the Group's balance sheet.
</P>
<P>
The most significant risks managed by the Group are:
</P>
<P>
o    Enterprise risk: the risk of loss from inadequate or failed internal
processes, people and systems or from external events.
<BR>
o    Credit risk: the possibility that the Group will incur losses from the
failure of a counterparty to meet its obligations or from changes in the
credit quality of a counterparty.
<BR>
o    Market risk: the possibility that the Group will incur losses from changes
in interest rates, foreign exchange rates or the prices of equity shares
and indices, commodities, debt securities and other financial contracts,
including derivatives.
<BR>
o    Liquidity risk: the risk that the Group will be unable to meet its funding
requirements at acceptable rates and appropriate maturities.
</P>
<P>
Enterprise risk
</P>
<P>
Enterprise risk is the term used by the Group to describe those risks faced by
the Group that are not managed by credit, liquidity, or market risk processes.
These risks, which include operational risks, can arise from inadequate or
failed internal processes and systems, staff error and management failure and
from changes to the legal, regulatory, political or operating environment of
any of the territories where the Group operates.
</P>
<P>
Primary responsibility for the day-to-day management of enterprise risk lies
with business unit executive management. They are responsible for establishing
and maintaining appropriate policies, procedures, internal controls and
business continuity arrangements. Internal controls include physical controls;
segregation of duties; appropriate authorisation limits; and procedures to
ensure compliance with laws and regulations. Group Risk is responsible for
providing assurance to GEMC on the level of risk within the Group and the
effectiveness of the Group's enterprise risk management processes. Within each
division, there are independent risk management units. Group Audit advises
business unit management and the Group Audit Committee on the quality and
effectiveness of the system of internal controls and identifies any significant
control deficiencies in the Group.

<HR CLASS="eolPageBreak">
<DIV CLASS="eolNewPage"></DIV>
<A NAME="eolPage119"></A>
<P>
Credit risk
</P>
<P>
Credit risk is the risk that customers and professional counterparties will not
meet their repayment obligations. This risk is managed within the Group's
credit risk management framework comprising:
</P>
<P>
Executive involvement through the GRMC. This sub-committee of the GEMC is
chaired by the Group Finance Director and includes other executive directors.
It defines the credit risk strategy of the Group and approves both policy
changes and other enhancements to the credit risk management framework.
</P>
<P>
On a day-to-day basis, executive directors and other GEMC members participate
in the Group, divisional and subsidiary company credit committees. These
committees hold the highest levels of credit authority (below Board level) in
the Group.
</P>
<P>
The Group's Credit Risk Management Principles set out the minimum standards.
These include:
</P>
<P>
o    All credit risk exposures require approval before assumption by the
Group. Existing credit risk exposures are monitored and reviewed
periodically (usually annually with the lower quality exposures being
subject to greater frequency of analysis). These approvals can only
be given by duly authorised individuals or bodies (credit committees)
or (in the case of retail businesses) through authorised automated
processes.
<BR>
o    Credit authority is delegated only to competent individuals who are
independent of business revenue generation or to credit committees.
Credit authority is not extended to branch or account relationship
managers.
<BR>
o    Credit risk exposures originated anywhere in the Group that create
obligations from the same counterparty group are aggregated (subject
to de minimis thresholds) in determining the appropriate level of
credit approval required and managed together.
<BR>
o    Customers/counterparties are assigned with a rating, which is mapped
to a Group scale that reflects the probability of default.
</P>
<P>
Approval process. Distinct approval processes exist for each of the significant
counterparty types to ensure appropriate skills and resources are employed:
</P>
<P>
o    Retail and personal businesses combine industry standard credit
scoring techniques, adapted for the Group, that process small scale,
large volume credit decisions, with traditional analysis and
judgement applying to more significant credit risks.
<BR>
o    Credit approvals for the professional counterparties of Financial
Markets are supported by a dedicated credit function providing
expertise in traded markets product risk and specialisation in
financial institutions analysis.
<BR>
o    For the Group's corporate businesses, the judgement exercised over
the credit approvals is supported by the relationship management
team, the Analysis Rating and Research Unit and the Credit Risk
Department.
</P>
<P>
The balance between risk and reward is managed by the credit approval process
and appropriate risk adjusted return measurement tools.
</P>
<P>
Portfolio management. The business units and GEMC review monthly reports on the
Group's portfolios of credit risks. Portfolio information is examined
principally by quality ratings but further sub-divided by major
division/subsidiary; by geography; and by industrial sector. Expected loss and
other statistical tools are used in trend analysis.
</P>
<P>
Oversight of delegated authority. Group Risk and divisional credit risk
functions undertake reviews to provide independent oversight of delegated
authority and compliance with Group practice.
</P>
<P>
Problem exposure management. Credit management within each business unit is the
responsibility of business unit credit committees. Specialist units within the
Group provide intensive management and control over the Group's impaired loans
to minimise the incidence of credit losses. In the Group's corporate
businesses, problem loans are managed by Specialised Lending Services which
provides dedicated resource experienced in corporate restructuring. The Problem
Exposure Review Forum reviews all such significant cases annually. This group
is chaired by the Group Chief Executive and includes the appropriate divisional
executive, account managers and credit managers. The Group's retail businesses

Market risk
</P>
<P>
The Group is exposed to market risk because of positions held in its treasury
and trading portfolios, as well as due to its non-trading activity.
</P>
<P>
Market risk in the treasury portfolios arises as a consequence of the
management of the Group's liquidity requirements. The instruments that give
rise to this type of risk are mainly money-market instruments and interest rate
derivatives, and the main risk factor is therefore predominantly interest
rates.
</P>
<P>
Market risk in the trading portfolios is mainly associated with the
customer-facing trading business, with the market-making operations and with
taking positions in tradeable securities. The associated instruments are held on
the trading (mark-to-market) books, and the main risk factors are interest
rates, credit spreads and foreign exchange.
</P>
<P>
Non-trading market risk is associated with the mismatches between the
re-pricing of the Group's non-trading financial assets and liabilities; with
the Group's investment in overseas subsidiaries, associates and branches; with
the Group's venture capital portfolio; with the investments held in Direct Line
Group; and with the strategic equity investment in Santander Central Hispano,
S.A. (&quot;SCH&quot;). Mismatch risk mainly gives rise to interest-rate exposure which
is then transferred to the Group's trading or treasury units for management
within their approved limits. The exception is Citizens, where the risk is
retained in the non-trading retail and commercial banks. Overseas investments
mainly give rise to structural foreign exchange exposure. The strategic
investment in SCH, the venture capital portfolio and the Direct Line Group
investments mainly give rise to equity exposure.
</P>
<P>
The Group's long-term assurance assets and liabilities attributable to
policyholders have been excluded from these market risk disclosures.
</P>
<P>
The Group manages the market risk in its trading and treasury portfolios
through its market risk management framework, which is based on Value-at-Risk
(&quot;VaR&quot;) limits, together with stress testing, scenario analysis, and position
and sensitivity limits. Stress testing measures the impact of abnormal changes
in market rates and prices on the fair value of the Group's trading portfolios.
GEMC approves the high-level VaR and stress limits for the Group. The Group
Risk function, independent from the Group's trading businesses, is responsible
for setting and monitoring the adequacy and effectiveness of the Group's market
risk management processes.
</P>
<P>
<SPAN STYLE="font-weight: bold">
Value-at-risk
</SPAN>
</P>
<P>
VaR is a technique that produces estimates of the potential negative change in
the market value of a portfolio over a specified time horizon at given
confidence levels. For internal risk management purposes, the Group's VaR
assumes a time horizon of one day and a confidence level of 95%. In other
words, a one-day loss greater than VaR is likely to occur on average on only
one in every 20 business days. In addition, the Group's VaR is also estimated
assuming a 10-day holding period.
</P>
<P>
The Group uses historical simulation models in computing VaR. This approach, in
common with many other VaR models, assumes that risk factor changes observed in
the past are a good estimate of those likely to occur in the future and is,
therefore, limited by the relevance of the historical data used. The Group's
method, however, does not make any assumption about the nature or type of the
underlying loss distribution. The Group typically uses the previous two years
of market data.
</P>
<P>
The Group's VaR should be interpreted in light of the limitations of the
methodologies used. These limitations include:
</P>
<P>
o    Historical data may not provide the best estimate of the joint
distribution of risk factor changes in the future and may fail to capture
the risk of possible extreme adverse market movements which have not
occurred in the historical window used in the calculations.
<BR>
o    VaR using a one-day time horizon does not fully capture the market risk of
positions that cannot be liquidated or hedged within one day.
<BR>
o    VaR using a 95% confidence level does not reflect the extent of potential
losses beyond that percentile.
<BR>
o    The Group largely computes the VaR of trading portfolios at the close of
business and positions may change substantially during the course of the
trading day. Controls are in place to limit the Group's intra-day exposure
and the VaR for selected portfolios is computed intra-day.
</P>
<P>
These limitations and the nature of the VaR measure mean that it should not be
viewed as a guarantee of the Group's ability to limit its market risk. The
Group cannot be certain that losses will not exceed the VaR amounts indicated
nor that losses in excess of the VaR amounts will not occur more frequently
than once in 20 business days.

different but closely related markets to profit from market imperfections; and
proprietary activity - taking positions in financial instruments as principal
to take advantage of anticipated market conditions. Financial instruments held

Retail and corporate banking
</P>
<P>
Structural interest rate risk arises in the Group's commercial banking
activities where assets and liabilities have different repricing dates. Group
policy requires that all material interest rate risk arising from retail and
corporate banking activities be transferred to a trading or treasury unit for
management within its approved limits. The exception to this approach is
Citizens, where the interest rate risk is retained within the regional banks.
</P>
<P>
Structural interest rate risk is calculated in each business unit on the basis
of establishing the repricing behaviour of each asset and liability product.
For many products, the actual interest rate repricing characteristics differ
from the contractual repricing.
</P>
<P>
In most cases, the repricing maturity is then determined by the market interest
rate that most closely fits the historical behaviour of the product interest
rate. For non-interest bearing current accounts, the repricing maturity is
determined by the stability of the portfolio. The repricing maturities used are
reviewed by both the Balance Sheet Management Committee and business unit asset
and liability committees annually, or more often if appropriate.
</P>
<P>
A static maturity gap report is produced as at the month-end for each material
business unit, in each functional currency based on the behaviouralised
repricing for each product. It is Group policy to include non-financial assets
and liabilities, mainly tangible fixed assets and the Group's capital and
reserves, spread over medium and longer term maturities, in the gap report.
This report also includes hedge transactions, principally derivatives. Any
residual non-trading interest rate exposures are measured and monitored against
limits using a version of the same VaR methodology, but without discount
factors, that is used for the Group's trading portfolios. Limits are also set
on the net interest income exposure over 12 months to a 1% parallel movement in
interest rates.
</P>
<P>
This VaR calculation includes all non-trading assets and liabilities in the
Group's balance sheet and is undertaken quarterly. At 31 December 2001, the
total VaR exposure relating to structural interest rate risk was estimated to
be (pound)8.8 million (31 December 2000 - (pound)5.1 million) with the major
exposures being to changes in longer term sterling and US dollar interest
rates. During the year, the maximum VaR was (pound)13.7 million, the minimum
<BR>
(pound)4.4 million and the average (pound)7.9 million. The major contributor to
this non-trading VaR is Citizens, which manages its structural interest rate
exposure partly through investment portfolios, which consist mainly of US
mortgage-backed securities.
</P>
<P>
In calculating the VaR exposure for the retail and commercial businesses there
are two main limitations:
</P>
<P>
(i)  only principal flows are included in the maturity ladders i.e. interest
flows are not included;
<BR>
(ii) whilst embedded option risk is managed (see below), the related VaR is not
included in the above VaR disclosure.
</P>
<P>
Option risk in the non-trading businesses principally occurs in certain fixed
rate assets and liabilities. An example is where businesses undertake to
provide funding to, or to accept deposits from, customers at a future date at a
pre-determined fixed interest rate. Derivatives are used to manage the risk of
interest rate movements from the date a commitment is made to a customer to the
date the transaction closes. Option risk also arises where customers can repay
fixed rate loans or withdraw fixed rate deposits before their maturity. In
managing this risk, modelling of how the level of early repayment varies with
interest rate movements is undertaken for the major fixed rate books. The Group
also seeks to protect itself from early repayment risk through the imposition
of early repayment interest charges,

where applicable. Option risk is also inherent in certain portfolios of
investment securities held by the Group, notably US mortgage-backed securities.

<P>
Currency risk
</P>
<P>
The Group does not maintain material non-trading open currency positions other
than the structural foreign currency translation exposures arising from its
investments in overseas subsidiary and associated undertakings and their
related currency funding. The Group's policy in relation to structural
positions is to match fund the structural foreign currency exposure arising
from net asset value, including goodwill, in overseas subsidiaries, equity
accounted investments and branches, except where doing so would materially
increase the sensitivity of either the Group's or subsidiary's regulatory
capital ratios to currency movements. The policy requires structural foreign
exchange positions to be reviewed regularly by the GALCO. Gains or losses on
foreign currency investments net of any gains or losses on related foreign
currency funding or hedges, are recognised in the statement of total recognised
gains and losses.

<P>
The structural foreign currency exposure in euros at 31 December 2001 is
principally due to Ulster Bank running an open structural foreign exchange
position to minimise the sensitivity of its capital ratios to possible
movements in the euro exchange rate against sterling.
</P>
<P>
Equity risk
</P>
<P>
Non-trading equity risk arises principally from the Group's strategic
investments, its venture capital activities and its general insurance business.
The reserves of the Group's general insurance business are invested in cash,
debt securities and equity shares. The VaR of the equity element of this
portfolio was (pound)7.8 million at 31 December 2001. VaR is not an appropriate
risk measure for the Group's venture capital investments, comprising a mix of
quoted and unquoted investments, or its portfolio of strategic investments. At
31 December 2001, equity shares held as investment securities had a book value
of (pound)1,528 million (31 December 2000 - (pound)1,437 million) and a
valuation of (pound)1,792 million (31 December 2000 - (pound)2,094 million).
</P>
<P>
Liquidity risk
</P>
<P>
Liquidity management within the Group focuses on the management of both overall
balance sheet structure and the control within prudent limits of risk arising
from the mismatch of maturities across the balance sheet and from contingent
obligations.
</P>
<P>
The structure of the Group's balance sheet is managed to maintain substantial
diversification, to minimise concentration across its various deposit sources,
and to contain the level of reliance on total and net short-term wholesale
sources of funds within prudent levels.
</P>
<P>
The short-term maturity structure of the Group's liabilities and assets is also
managed on a daily basis to ensure that contractual cashflow obligations, and
potential cashflows arising from undrawn commitments and other contingent
obligations, may be met as they arise from day to day, either from cash inflows
from maturing assets, new borrowing or from the sale or repo of various debt
securities held.
</P>
<P>
The short-term liquidity risk is managed on a consolidated basis for the whole
Group excluding the activities of Citizens and insurance businesses in the UK
which are subject to regulatory regimes which necessitate the separate
management of liquidity. Internal liquidity mismatch limits are set for all
other subsidiaries and non-UK branches which have material local treasury
activities in external markets, to ensure those activities do not compromise
daily maintenance of the Group's overall liquidity risk position within the
Group's policy parameters.
</P>
<DIV CLASS="eolCenter">
122
</DIV>
<HR CLASS="eolPageBreak">
<DIV CLASS="eolNewPage"></DIV>
<A NAME="eolPage124"></A>
<P>
The level of large deposits taken from banks, corporate customers, non-bank
financial institutions and other customers, and significant cash outflows
therefrom, are also reviewed to monitor concentration and identify any adverse
trends.
</P>
<P>
The degree of maturity mismatch within the overall long-term structure of the
Group's assets and liabilities is also managed within internal policy limits,
to ensure that term asset commitments may be funded on an economic basis over
their life. In managing its overall term structure, the Group analyses and
takes into account the effect of retail and corporate customer behaviour on
actual asset and liability maturities where that differs materially from the
underlying contractual maturities.
</P>
<P>
Policy parameters for the control of overall balance sheet structure and
liquidity risk are set by the GALCO. Compliance is monitored and co-ordinated
by the Group Treasury function both in respect of internal policy and the
regulatory requirements of the FSA.
</P>
<P>
In addition to their consolidation within the Group's daily liquidity
management processes, it is also the responsibility of all Group subsidiaries
and branches outside the UK to ensure compliance with all separate local
regulatory liquidity requirements applicable.
</P>
<P>
The Group also periodically evaluates various scenarios to analyse the
potential impact on its liquidity risk. Contingency plans are maintained to
anticipate and respond to any approaching or actual material deterioration in
market conditions.
</P>
<P>
Sources of funding
</P>
<P>
Excluding capital and other liabilities, customer accounts continue to provide
a substantial majority of the Group's funding and represent a well diversified
and stable source of funds from a wide range of retail, corporate and non-bank
institutional customers.

Customer accounts, excluding repos, grew by (pound)23,959 million (up 15.2%)
and continue to represent approximately 64% of the Group's funding excluding
capital and other liabilities. Part of the overall increase in customer
accounts reflects the Mellon acquisition in December 2001. Excluding that
element, the underlying increase in the Group's customer accounts was
<BR>
(pound)13,831 million (up 8.8%).

Repos with corporate and institutional customers are undertaken primarily by
Greenwich Capital Markets in the USA and by Financial Markets. Repo activity
with customers declined to represent 6.1% of the Group's funding excluding
capital and other liabilities at 31 December 2001 (compared with 8.1% at 31
December 2000).

Deposits by banks increased in line with growth in the Group balance sheet to
remain at just over 14% of the Group's funding excluding capital and other
liabilities. Deposits by banks are taken from a wide range of counterparties,
with the largest single depositor continuing to represent less than 1% of the
Group's total funding.

<P>
Debt securities in issue increased to represent 10.8% of the Group's funding
excluding capital and other liabilities at 31 December 2001 (compared with 7.9%
at 31 December 2000). Total debt securities in issue at 31 December 2001
include (pound)5,969 million ((pound)5,645 million at 31 December 2000) with a

The Group remains well placed to access various wholesale funding sources from

Net customer lending rose by (pound)1,075 million increasing structural

As for customer accounts, part of the overall increase in loans and advances to
customers reflects the acquisition in December 2001 by Citizens of the regional
retail and commercial operations of Mellon Financial Corporation for which
customer accounts acquired exceeded loans and advances to customers by
<BR>
(pound)5,663 million. Excluding that element, the underlying change in the
Group's net customer lending was an increase of (pound)6,738 million.
</P>
<P>
In prevailing economic conditions and with interest rates at historically low
levels in the UK, US and Europe, it is anticipated that the growth in demand
for further borrowing by customers will in the medium term continue to exceed
that for customer deposits received, thus increasing net customer lending
further and increasing gradually over time the Group's dependence on the
wholesale market for funding. The Group has evaluated a range of balance sheet
management strategies to address the consequent impact on its liquidity risk
position and has developed plans to contain that within its normal policy
parameters.

<DIV CLASS="eolNewPage"></DIV>
<A NAME="eolPage126"></A>
<P>
The Group's net surplus of wholesale assets has increased, reducing overall
structural liquidity risk. In line with the net customer activity acquired, the
surplus of wholesale assets includes the effect of the Mellon acquisition in
December 2001, which increased the Group's net wholesale assets by (pound)5,594
million. Excluding that element, the Group's net surplus of wholesale assets
declined by (pound)3,914 million to (pound)15,907 million.
</P>
<P>
Comparing the maturity and net level of deposits by banks with loans and
advances to banks, the Group's liquidity position has improved. Deposits by
banks net of loans and advances to banks decreased from (pound)3,055 million to
<BR>
(pound)1,517 million and the maturity structure has lengthened. Net bank
deposits repayable on demand fell by (pound)1,552 million and net bank deposits
of less than 3 months' maturity fell by (pound)3,458 million, whilst net bank
lending of over 3 months maturity increased by (pound)3,472 million.
</P>
<P>
The reduction in net bank deposits and in net customer repos has also been more
than offset by an increase in debt securities in issue, again typically
lengthening the maturity structure of the Group's funding and improving
liquidity.
</P>
<P>
Sterling liquidity
</P>
<P>
Over 55% of the Group's total assets are denominated in sterling. The FSA
requires the Group on a consolidated basis to maintain daily a minimum ratio of
100% between:
</P>
<P>
a)   a stock of qualifying high quality liquid assets (primarily UK government
securities, treasury bills, eligible bank bills, and cash held in
branches) and
</P>
<P>
b)   the sum of :
</P>
<P>
o    sterling wholesale net outflows contractually due within 5 working
days (offset up to a limit of 50%, by 85% of sterling certificates of
deposit held which mature beyond 5 working days), and
<BR>
o    5% of retail deposits with a residual contractual maturity of 5
working days or less.
</P>
<P>
The Group has exceeded that minimum ratio requirement during 2001.
</P>
<P>
The FSA also sets an absolute minimum level for the stock of qualifying liquid
assets that the Group is required to maintain each day. The Group has exceeded
that minimum stock requirement at all times during 2001.
</P>
<P>
The Group's operational processes are actively managed to ensure that both the
minimum sterling liquidity ratio and the minimum stock requirement are achieved
or exceeded at all times.
</P>
<P>
Liquidity in non-sterling currencies
</P>
<P>
For non-sterling currencies, no specific regulatory liquidity requirement is
set for the Group by the FSA. However, the importance of managing prudently the
liquidity risk in its non-sterling activities is recognised and the Group
manages its non-sterling liquidity risk daily within net mismatch limits set
for the 0-8 calendar day and 0-1 month periods as a percentage of the Group's
total deposit liabilities.
</P>
<P>
In measuring its non-sterling liquidity risk, due account is taken of the
marketability within a short period of the wide range of debt securities held.
Haircuts are applied in each case, dependent on various parameters, to
determine the Group's ability to realise cash at short notice if required to
meet unexpected outflows via the sale or repo of such marketable assets.
</P>
<P>
The level of contingent risk from the potential drawing of undrawn or partially
drawn commitments, back-up lines, standby lines and other similar facilities is
also actively monitored and reflected in the measures of the Group's
non-sterling liquidity risk. Particular attention is given to the US$
commercial paper market and the propensity of the Group's corporate
counterparties who are active in raising funds from that market to switch to
take up facilities offered by the Group in the event of either counterparty
specific difficulties or a significant widening of interest spreads generally
in the commercial paper market.
</P>
<P>
The Group also provides liquidity back-up facilities to both its own conduits
and certain other conduits which take funding from the US$ commercial paper
market. Limits sanctioned for such facilities totalled less than (pound)6,300
million at 31 December 2001. The short-term contingent liquidity risk in
providing such back-up facilities is also mitigated by the spread of maturity
dates typically over a 3-month period of the commercial paper taken by the
conduits.
</P>
<P>
The Group has operated within its non-sterling liquidity policy mismatch limits
at all times during the 2001 period and operational processes are actively
managed to ensure that is the case going forward.
</P>
<P>
Contingency plans are also maintained to enable the Group to respond
effectively to unforeseen market liquidity or major payment systems problems
which may emerge from time to time. Post the events in New York on 11 September
2001, the Group took swift action to bolster its liquidity position in both
sterling and non-sterling currencies in the light of market uncertainties and
potential payment systems difficulties which prevailed at that time and for a
period subsequently.

<A NAME="eolPage127"></A>
<P>
Insurance risk
</P>
<P>
The Group sells and underwrites general insurance and life assurance. The
essence of an insurance contract is the transfer of risk from the policyholder
to the insurer. The Group controls its insurance exposures through product
design and policy wording and through pricing and underwriting procedures. The
Group's underwriting experience, the level of retained risk and solvency are
closely monitored. Investment strategy reflects the maturity of underwriting
liabilities. Underwriting concentrations and catastrophe exposure are reviewed
and where necessary mitigated by reinsurance.
</P>
<P>
Residual value risk
</P>
<P>
The Group's asset finance activities expose the Group risk of loss if the value
of the physical asset at the end of the financing term is less than that
required to achieve the planned return. The Group mitigates this rise through
portfolio diversification and active management of asset exposures throughout
their life, from pricing through to re-marketing at the end of the transition
term.
</P>
<P>
(b)  Financial instruments
</P>
<P>
Financial instruments are fundamental to the Group's business and constitute
the core element of its operations. The risks associated with financial
instruments are a significant component of the risks faced by the Group.
Financial instruments create, modify or reduce the credit, market and liquidity
risks of the Group's balance sheet. Each of these risks and the Group's
policies and objectives for managing such risks are discussed above.
</P>
<P>
The purpose for which the Group holds or issues financial instruments can be
classified into five main categories.
</P>
<P>
o  Customer loans and deposits
</P>
<P>
Customer loans and deposits (both retail and institutional) form a substantial
part of the Group's business. The customer loan portfolio is the Group's
largest asset and the interest received from such loans is the Group's core
source of income.
</P>
<P>
The Group has detailed policies and strategies in respect of its customer loans
and deposits which seek to minimise the risks associated with these financial
instruments.
</P>
<P>
o  Investments (equity shares and debt securities)
</P>
<P>
The Group holds shares and other securities, excluding strategic investments,
for use on a continuing basis in the Group's activities. The objective of
holding such financial instruments is to generate funds over the term of the
investment, in the form of distributions and/or appreciation in value. Funds
generated are used in the Group's operations.
</P>
<P>
o Finance (money market loans and deposits, loan capital, debt securities in
issue, preference shares)
</P>
<P>
The Group issues financial instruments to fund that portion of the Group's
assets not funded by customer deposits. The objective of using financial
instruments for financing purposes is to manage the Group's balance sheet in
terms of minimising market risk. Responsibility for overseeing and implementing
balance sheet management lies with Group Treasury.
</P>
<P>
o  Trading (foreign exchange, derivatives, debt securities, loans and deposits)
</P>
<P>
The Group trades in financial instruments for customer facilitation and as
principal. The objective of trading in financial instruments is to maximise
short term gains for both the customer and/or the Group. Trading activity is
restricted to certain areas in the Group and is subject to strict policies and
limits. Responsibility for setting trading policies and monitoring adherence
thereto lies with Group Risk.
</P>
<P>
o  Hedging (derivatives, loans and deposits, debt securities)
</P>
<P>
Where financial instruments form part of the Group's risk management strategy
they are classified as hedges. The objective for holding financial instruments
as hedges is to match or eliminate the risk arising because of adverse
movements in interest rates, exchange rates, credit ratings, equity prices or
commodity prices. Derivatives are the main instruments used for hedging and are
discussed further below.
</P>
<P>
Funding in the form of loans and deposits and preference shares is used to
hedge certain of the Group's equity investments. Fixed rate debt securities are
periodically used to hedge issued preference shares.

The following table sets forth activities of a non-trading nature undertaken by
the Group, the related risks associated with such activities, and provides
details of the types of derivatives used in managing such risks.

RISK FACTORS
</SPAN>
</P>
<P>
Set forth below are certain risk factors which could affect the Group's future
results and cause them to be materially different from expected results.
However, the Group's results could also be affected by competition and other
factors. The factors discussed in this report should not be regarded as a
complete and comprehensive statement of all potential risks and uncertainties.
</P>
<P>
<SPAN STYLE="font-weight: bold">
THE FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE OF THE GROUP IS AFFECTED BY BORROWER CREDIT QUALITY
AND GENERAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, IN PARTICULAR IN THE UK.
</SPAN>
</P>
<P>
Risks arising from changes in credit quality and the recoverability of loans
and amounts due from counterparties are inherent in a wide range of the Group's
businesses. Adverse changes in the credit quality of the Group's borrowers and
counterparties or a general deterioration in UK or global economic conditions,
or arising from systemic risks in the financial systems, could reduce the
recoverability and value of the Group's assets and require an increase in the
Group's level of provisions for bad and doubtful debts.
</P>
<P>
<SPAN STYLE="font-weight: bold">
CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES, FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATES, EQUITY PRICES AND OTHER
MARKET FACTORS AFFECT THE GROUP'S BUSINESS.
</SPAN>
</P>
<P>
The most significant market risks the Group faces are interest rate, foreign
exchange and bond and equity price risks. Changes in interest rate levels,
yield curves and spreads may affect the interest rate margin realised between
lending and borrowing costs. Changes in currency rates, particularly in the
sterling-dollar and sterling-euro exchange rates, affect the value of assets
and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies and affect earnings reported
by the Group's non-UK subsidiaries and may affect revenues from foreign
exchange dealing. The performance of financial markets may cause changes in the
value of the Group's investment and trading portfolios. The Group has
implemented risk management methods to mitigate and control these and other
market risks to which the Group is exposed. However, it is difficult to predict
with accuracy changes in economic or market conditions and to anticipate the
effects that such changes could have on the Group's financial performance and
business operations.
</P>
<P>
<SPAN STYLE="font-weight: bold">
OPERATIONAL RISKS ARE INHERENT IN THE GROUP'S BUSINESS.
</SPAN>
</P>
<P>
The Group's businesses are dependent on the ability to process a large number
of transactions efficiently and accurately. Operational risk and losses can
result from fraud, errors by employees, failure properly to document
transactions or to obtain proper internal authorisation, failure to comply with
regulatory requirements and Conduct of Business rules, equipment failures,
natural disasters or the failure of external systems, for example, the Group's
suppliers or counterparties. Although the Group has implemented risk controls
and loss mitigation actions, and substantial resources are devoted to
developing efficient procedures and to staff training, it is only possible to be
reasonably, but not absolutely, certain that such procedures will be effective
in controlling each of the operational risks faced by the Group.
</P>
<P>
EACH OF THE GROUP'S BUSINESSES ARE SUBJECT TO SUBSTANTIAL REGULATION AND
REGULATORY OVERSIGHT. ANY SIGNIFICANT REGULATORY DEVELOPMENTS COULD HAVE AN
EFFECT ON HOW THE GROUP CONDUCTS ITS BUSINESS AND ON THE GROUP'S RESULTS OF
OPERATIONS.
</P>
<P>
The Group is subject to financial services laws, regulations, administrative
actions and policies in each location in which the Group operates. This
supervision and regulation, in particular in the UK, if changed could
materially affect the Group's business, the products and services offered or
the value of assets. For example, the Government, in conjunction with the UK
FSA, has commissioned an examination of the retail savings industry and its
approach to investment to see whether resources are being allocated efficiently
and whether consumers are being well served. The Group cannot predict the
timing or form of any future regulatory initiatives.
</P>
<P>
<SPAN STYLE="font-weight: bold">
INTEGRATION OF ACQUIRED BUSINESSES CAN AFFECT THE GROUP'S RESULTS.
</SPAN>
</P>
<P>
The businesses acquired as part of the acquisition of NatWest, the regional
retail and commercial business of Mellon Financial Corporation and other recent
acquisitions are being integrated into the existing businesses of the Group.
This integration process involves major changes to the management structures of
the acquired businesses, large-scale migration of computer processing onto the
Group's existing IT platform, and many other integration projects to align the
acquired businesses with that of the Group. There is, therefore, an increased
risk of operational failure during the integration process. Substantial
resources are allocated to planning, management, monitoring and implementation
of integration projects to minimise the risk that such projects are not
completed on schedule or within budgeted costs.

<A NAME="eolPage130"></A>
<P>
The Group's future growth in earnings and shareholder value depends on
strategic decisions regarding organic growth and potential acquisitions.
</P>
<P>
The Group devotes substantial management and planning resources to the
development of strategic plans for organic growth and identification of
possible acquisitions, supported by substantial expenditure to generate growth
in customer business. If these strategic plans do not meet with success, the
Group's earnings could grow more slowly or decline.
</P>
<P>
<SPAN STYLE="font-weight: bold">
THE GROUP'S INSURANCE BUSINESSES ARE SUBJECT TO INHERENT RISKS INVOLVING CLAIMS
PROVISIONS.
</SPAN>
</P>
<P>
Future claims in the Group's general and life assurance business may be higher
than expected as a result of changing trends in claims experience resulting
from catastrophic weather conditions, demographic developments, changes in
mortality and other causes outside the Group's control. Such changes would
affect the profitability of current and future insurance products and services.
</P>
<P>
THE UK GOVERNMENT HAS ACCEPTED THE RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE COMPETITION
COMMISSION (&quot;CC&quot;) IN RESPECT OF ITS INQUIRY INTO THE UK MARKET FOR SMALL
BUSINESS BANKING. THE RECOMMENDATIONS INCLUDE THE IMPLEMENTATION OF A NUMBER OF
BEHAVIOURAL MEASURES AND THE PAYMENT OF INTEREST ON SMALL AND MEDIUM SIZED
ENTERPRISES (&quot;SMES&quot;) CURRENT ACCOUNTS IN CREDIT IN ENGLAND AND WALES.
</P>
<P>
On 14 March 2002, the UK Government announced that it had accepted in full the
recommendations of the CC in connection with its inquiry into the provision of
banking services to SMEs in the UK (see page 88). A process has now started
whereby the detail behind the implementation of these remedies is agreed with
the Office of Fair Trading (&quot;OFT&quot;). There remains a number of uncertainties over
the precise form which this implementation will take and the timing of such
implementation, although the CC has suggested that it sees no reason why this
should not be within six months of the publication of its report. The Group
is currently analysing the implications of the report.

STATEMENT OF DIRECTORS' RESPONSIBILITIES
</SPAN>
</P>
<P>
UK company law requires the directors to prepare financial statements for each
financial year which give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the
Company and the Group as at the end of the financial year and of the profit or
loss of the Group for that year. In preparing those financial statements, the
directors are required to:
</P>
<P>
o    select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
</P>
<P>
o    make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent; and
</P>
<P>
o    state whether applicable accounting standards have been followed, subject
to any material departures disclosed and explained in the financial
statements.
</P>
<P>
The directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records which
disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the
Group and to enable them to ensure that the financial statements comply with
the UK Companies Act 1985. They are also responsible for safeguarding the
assets of the Company and the Group and hence for taking reasonable steps for
the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
</P>
<P>
By order of the Board.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS

</P>
<P>
To the Board of directors and shareholders of The Royal Bank of Scotland Group
plc
</P>
<P>
We have audited the Consolidated balance sheet of The Royal Bank of Scotland
Group plc and its subsidiary undertakings as at 31 December 2001 and 2000, and
the Consolidated profit and loss account, the Consolidated cash flow statement,
the Statement of consolidated total recognised gains and losses and the
Reconciliation of movements in shareholder funds for the years ended 31
December 2001 and 2000, the 15 month period ended 31 December 2000 and the 3
month period ended 31 December 1999. These financial statements are the
responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. The Consolidated
Financial Statements of the Group as of 30 September 1999 and for the year then
ended were audited by other auditors whose reports, dated 17 December 1999 and
9 May 2001, expressed an unqualified opinion on those statements.
</P>
<P>
We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally
accepted in the United States of America. Those standards require that we plan
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the
consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit
includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as
well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe
that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
</P>
<P>
In our opinion, such 31 December 2001, 31 December 2000 and 31 December 1999
financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial
position of The Royal Bank of Scotland Group plc and its subsidiary
undertakings at 31 December 2001 and 2000, and the results of their operations
and cash flows for the year ended 31 December 2001 and for each of the 15 and
12 month periods ended 31 December 2000, and the 3 month period ended 31
December 1999 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in
the United Kingdom.
</P>
<P>
Accounting principles generally accepted in the United Kingdom vary in certain
material respects from accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States of America. The application of the latter would have affected the
determination of net income for the year ended 31 December 2001, each of the 15
and 12 month periods ended 31 December 2000 and the 3 month period ended 31
December 1999 and the determination of the consolidated shareholders' equity at
31 December 2001 and 2000 to the extent described in Note 52 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements.

ACCOUNTING POLICIES
</SPAN>
</P>
<P>
The Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with
applicable Accounting Standards in the UK and the Statements of Recommended
Accounting Practice issued jointly by the British Bankers' Association and the
Irish Bankers' Federation. A summary of the more important accounting policies
is set out below. The Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared in
accordance with the special provisions of Part VII of the Companies Act 1985
relating to banking groups. The financial statements of the Company are
prepared in accordance with section 226 of, and Schedule 4 to, the Companies
Act 1985. As permitted by section 230(3) of the Companies Act 1985, no profit
and loss account is presented for the Company.
</P>
<P>
Disclosures required by Financial Reporting Standard (&quot;FRS&quot;) 17 'Retirement
Benefits' are included in Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Further disclosures under the transitional requirements of this standard will
be made in the Group's financial statements for 2002, and full implementation
is required from 2003.
</P>
<P>
Implementation of FRS 18 'Accounting Policies' has not resulted in any changes
to the Group's principal accounting policies.
</P>
<P>
(a)  Accounting convention and bases of consolidation.  The Consolidated
Financial Statements are prepared under the historical cost convention
modified by the periodic revaluation of premises and certain investments.
To avoid undue delay in the presentation of the accounts, the accounts of
certain subsidiary undertakings have been made up to 30 November. There
have been no changes in respect of these subsidiary undertakings, in the
period from their balance sheet dates to 31 December, that materially
affect the view given by the Group's Consolidated Financial Statements.
</P>
<P>
(b)  Goodwill.  Goodwill is the excess of the cost of acquisition of subsidiary
and associated undertakings over the fair value of the Group's share of
net tangible assets acquired. Goodwill arising on acquisitions of
subsidiary and associated undertakings after 1 October 1998 is capitalised
on the balance sheet and amortised on a straight-line basis over its
estimated useful economic life. Goodwill arising on acquisitions of
subsidiary and associated undertakings prior to 1 October 1998, previously
charged directly against profit and loss account reserves, was not
reinstated under the transitional provisions of FRS 10 'Goodwill and
Intangible Assets'. It will be written back only on disposal of the
related subsidiary or associated undertaking and reflected in the
calculation of the gains and losses arising.
</P>
<P>
(c)  Foreign currencies. Assets and liabilities denominated in foreign
currencies are translated into sterling at the rates of exchange ruling at
the balance sheet date. Profit and loss accounts of overseas branches and
subsidiary undertakings are translated at the average rates of exchange
for the period. Exchange differences arising from the application of
closing rates of exchange to the opening net assets of overseas branches
and subsidiary undertakings and from restating their results from average
to period-end rates are taken to profit and loss account reserves,
together with exchange differences arising on related foreign currency
borrowings.
</P>
<P>
(d)  Pensions and other post-retirement benefits. The Group provides
post-retirement benefits in the form of pensions and healthcare plans to
eligible employees. The cost of defined benefit pension schemes and
healthcare plans is assessed by independent professionally qualified
actuaries and recognised on a systematic basis over employees' service
lives. Contributions to defined contribution pension schemes are
recognised in the profit and loss account when payable.
</P>
<P>
(e)  Leases. Total gross earnings under finance leases are allocated to
accounting periods using the actuarial after tax method to give a constant
periodic rate of return on the net cash investment. Finance lease
receivables are stated in the balance sheet at the amount of the net
investment in the lease. Progress payments made prior to the commencement
of the lease are included at cost. Rental income from operating leases is
credited to the profit and loss account on a receivable basis over the
term of the lease. Balance sheet carrying values of finance lease
receivables and operating lease assets include amounts in respect of the
residual values of the leased assets. Unguaranteed residual values are
subject to regular review to identify potential impairments. Provisions
are made for impairment arising on specific asset categories.
</P>
<P>
(f)  General insurance. In calculating operating profit from general insurance
activities, premiums are recognised in the accounting period in which they
begin. Unearned premiums represent the proportion of the premiums that
relate to periods of insurance after the balance sheet date and are
calculated on a daily or 24th's basis. Provision is made where necessary
for the estimated amount required over and above unearned premiums to meet
future claims and related expenses and is calculated by class of business
on the basis of a separate carry forward of deferred acquisition expenses
after making allowance for investment income. Acquisition expenses
relating to new and renewed motor and household policies are deferred over
the period during which the premiums are unearned, generally twelve
months. The principal acquisition costs so deferred are direct advertising
expenditure and costs associated with the telesales and underwriting
staff. Claims are recognised in the accounting period in which the loss
occurs. Provision is made for the full cost of settling outstanding claims
at the balance sheet date, including claims estimated to have been
incurred but not yet reported at that date, and claims handling expenses.

ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)
</SPAN>
</P>
<P>
(g)  Long-term life assurance business. The value placed on the Group's
long-term life assurance business comprises the net assets of the Group's
life assurance subsidiaries, including its interest in the surpluses
retained within the long-term assurance funds, and the present value of
profits inherent in in-force policies. In calculating the value of
in-force policies, future surpluses expected to emerge are estimated using
appropriate assumptions as to future mortality, persistency and levels of
expenses, which are then discounted at a risk-adjusted rate. Changes in
this value, which is determined on a post-tax basis, are included in
operating profit, grossed up at the underlying rate of taxation.
</P>
<P>
Long-term assurance assets attributable to policyholders are valued on the
following bases: equity shares and debt securities at market price;
investment properties and loans at valuation. These assets are held in the
life funds of the Group's life assurance companies, and although legally
owned by them, the Group only benefits from these assets when surpluses
are declared. To reflect the distinct nature of the long-term assurance
assets, they are shown separately on the consolidated balance sheet, as
are liabilities attributable to policyholders.
</P>
<P>
(h)  Loans and advances. The Group makes provisions for bad and doubtful debts,
through charges to the profit and loss account, so as to record loans and
advances at their expected ultimate net realisable value.
</P>
<P>
Specific provisions are made against individual loans and advances that
the Group no longer expects to recover in full. For the Group's portfolios
of smaller balance homogeneous advances, such as credit card receivables,
specific provisions are established on a portfolio basis taking into
account the level of arrears, security and past loss experience. For loans
and advances that are individually assessed, the specific provision is
determined from a review of the financial condition of the counterparty
and any guarantor and takes into account the nature and value of any
security held.
</P>
<P>
The general provision is made to cover bad and doubtful debts that have
not been separately identified at the balance sheet date but are known to
be present in any portfolio of advances. The level of general provision is
determined in the light of past experience, current economic and other
factors affecting the business environment and the Group's monitoring and
control procedures, including the scope of specific provisioning
procedures.
</P>
<P>
Specific and general provisions are deducted from loans and advances. When
there is significant doubt that interest receivable can be collected, it
is excluded from the profit and loss account and credited to an interest
suspense account. Loans and advances and suspended interest are written
off in part or in whole when there is no realistic prospect of recovery.
</P>
<P>
(i)  Taxation. Provision is made for taxation at current rates on taxable
profits taking into account relief for overseas taxation where
appropriate. Certain items of income and expenditure are accounted for in
different periods for financial reporting purposes and for taxation
purposes. Deferred taxation is provided on the liability method in respect
of such timing differences to the extent that they are likely to
crystallise in the foreseeable future. It is calculated at rates expected
to be applicable when the liabilities or assets are expected to
crystallise.
</P>
<P>
(j)  Fees receivable. Fees receivable that represent a return for services
provided are recognised in the profit and loss account so as to match the
cost of providing the service. Certain front-end lending fees are
recognised over the life of the loan.
</P>
<P>
(k)  Debt securities and equity shares. Debt securities and equity shares
intended for use on a continuing basis in the Group's activities are
classified as investment securities and are stated at cost less provision
for any permanent diminution in value. The cost of dated investment
securities is adjusted for the amortisation of premiums or discounts over
periods to redemption and the amortisation is included in interest
receivable. Debt securities held for the purpose of hedging are carried at
a value that reflects the accounting treatment of the items hedged. Other
debt securities and equity shares are carried at fair value, with changes
in fair value recognised in the profit and loss account.
</P>
<P>
(l)  Shares in Group undertakings. The Company's shares in subsidiary
undertakings are stated in the balance sheet of the Company at directors'
valuation that takes account of the subsidiary undertakings' net asset
values.
</P>
<P>
(m)  Interests in associated undertakings. Interests in associated undertakings
are accounted for by the equity method and are stated in the consolidated
balance sheet at the Group's share of their net tangible assets. The
Group's share of the results of associated undertakings is included in the
consolidated profit and loss account. For this purpose, the latest
available audited accounts are used together with available unaudited
interim accounts.

(n)  Tangible fixed assets. Freehold and long leasehold properties are revalued
on a rolling basis, each property being revalued at least every five
years. Other tangible fixed assets are stated at cost less depreciation
and provisions for impairment. Costs of adapting premises for the use of
the Group are separately identified and depreciated.
</P>
<P>
Tangible fixed assets are depreciated over their estimated economic lives
on a straight-line basis, as follows:

<P>
Assets on operating leases are depreciated over their estimated useful
lives on a straight-line or reverse-annuity basis.
</P>
<P>
Investment properties are revalued annually to open market value. No
depreciation is charged on freehold investment properties, in accordance
with the requirements of Statement of Standard Accounting Practice 19
'Accounting for investment properties'. This is a departure from the
requirements of the Companies Act 1985 which requires all tangible fixed
assets to be depreciated. Investment properties are held not for
consumption but for investment and the directors consider that to
depreciate them would not give a true and fair view. It is not practicable
to assess estimated useful lives for investment properties, and
accordingly the effect of not depreciating them cannot be reasonably
quantified.
</P>
<P>
(o)  Derivatives. The Group enters into derivative transactions including
futures, forwards, swaps and options principally in the interest rate,
foreign exchange and equity markets. The accounting treatment for these
instruments is dependent upon whether they are entered into for trading or
non-trading (hedging) purposes.
</P>
<P>
Trading. Derivatives held for trading purposes are recognised in the
accounts at fair value. Gains or losses arising from changes in fair value
are included in dealing profits in the consolidated profit and loss
account. Fair value is based on quoted market prices. Where representative
market prices are not available, the fair value is determined from current
market information using appropriate pricing or valuation models.
Adjustments are made to quoted market prices where appropriate to cover
credit risk, liquidity risk and future operational costs. In the
consolidated balance sheet, positive fair values (assets) of trading
derivatives are included in Other assets and negative fair values
(liabilities) in Other liabilities. Positive and negative fair values of
trading derivatives are offset where the contracts have been entered into
under master netting agreements or other arrangements that give a legally
enforceable right of set-off.
</P>
<P>
Non-trading. Non-trading derivatives are entered into by the Group to hedge
exposures arising from transactions entered into in the normal course of
banking activities. They are recognised in the accounts in accordance with
the accounting treatment of the underlying transaction or transactions
being hedged. To be classified as non-trading, a derivative must match or
eliminate the risk inherent in the hedged item from potential movements in
interest rates, exchange rates and market values. In addition, there must
be a demonstrable link to an underlying transaction, pool of transactions
or specified future transaction or transactions. Specified future
transactions must be reasonably certain to arise for the derivative to be
accounted for as a hedge. In the event that a non-trading derivative
transaction is terminated or ceases to be an effective hedge, the
derivative is re-measured at fair value and any resulting profit or loss
amortised over the remaining life of the underlying transaction or
transactions being hedged. If a hedged item is derecognised, or a
specified future transaction is no longer likely to occur, the related
non-trading derivative is remeasured at fair value and the resulting
profit or loss taken to the profit and loss account.
</P>
<P>
(p)  Sale and repurchase transactions. Securities which have been sold with an
agreement to repurchase continue to be shown on the balance sheet and the
sale proceeds recorded as a deposit. Securities acquired in reverse sale
and repurchase transactions are not recognised in the balance sheet and
the purchase price is treated as a loan. The difference between the sale
price and repurchase price is accrued evenly over the life of the
transaction and charged or credited to the profit and loss account as
interest payable or receivable.

CHANGES IN ACCOUNTING PRESENTATION
</SPAN>
</P>
<P>
Following the acquisition of NatWest in March 2000, the following changes to
the accounting presentation adopted by the Group were made in respect of the
year ended 30 September 1999, to give a fairer presentation of the results of
enlarged Group.
</P>
<P>
(a)  Interest receivable and interest payable on trading assets and liabilities
previously shown in net interest income are now included in dealing
profits. As a result of this change, interest receivable and interest
payable were reduced by (pound)143 million and (pound)135 million
respectively and dealing profits were increased by (pound)8 million.
</P>
<P>
(b)  Fraud losses, formerly included in provisions for bad and doubtful debts,
are now included in administrative expenses. The charge for bad and
doubtful debt provisions has decreased by (pound)10 million, with a
corresponding increase in administrative expenses - other.
</P>
<P>
(c)  Credit card processing costs are now reported in fees and commissions
payable increasing this profit and loss caption by (pound)36 million and
reducing administrative expenses - other by the same amount.
</P>
<P>
(d)  Following an analysis of staff costs, transfers have been made within
administrative expenses: (pound)18 million from staff costs to other costs
and (pound)27 million from premises and equipment to staff costs.
</P>
<P>
These changes in presentation did not affect profit before tax, total assets or
shareholders' funds.

3.   Pension costs
</P>
<P>
The Group operates a number of pension schemes throughout the world. The main
schemes are defined benefit schemes whose assets are independent of the Group's
finances. The total pension cost for the Group was (pound)180 million (15
months ended 31 December 2000 - (pound)144 million). At 31 December 2001, there
was a pension cost prepayment of (pound)115 million and accrual of (pound)33
million (31 December 2000 - prepayment (pound)90 million and accrual of
<BR>
(pound)14 million).
</P>
<P>
There are two main UK pension schemes - The Royal Bank of Scotland Staff
Pension Scheme and the National Westminster Bank Pension Fund. Scheme
valuations are carried out by independent professionally qualified actuaries to
determine pension costs, using the projected unit method; any imbalance between
assets and liabilities is adjusted over the average future service life of
members of the scheme. The assumptions that have the most significant effect on
the results of the valuations are those relating to the valuation rate of
interest and the rates of increases in salaries and pensions.
</P>
<P>
On the acquisition of NatWest in March 2000, a surplus of (pound)1,070 million
on its major schemes was recognised in the consolidated balance sheet, and is
being amortised over the average future service life of members of the schemes.
The unamortised balance as at 31 December 2001 was (pound)920 million and is
included in 'Other assets'.

On the historical cost basis, the Group's freehold and long leasehold premises
would have been included at (pound)3,368 million (31 December 2000 -
<BR>
(pound)1,726 million).
</P>
<P>
Freehold and long leasehold properties are revalued on a rolling basis, each
property being valued at least every five years. Interim valuations outwith the
5 year cycle will be carried out on properties where there is an indication
that their value has changed significantly, given market conditions. The
directors are not aware of any material change in the valuation of the Group's
properties and therefore no additional interim valuations were required.
</P>
<P>
Properties occupied by the Group are valued on the basis of Existing Use Value,
except for certain specialised properties which are valued on a Depreciated
Replacement Cost basis. Investment and development properties and properties to
be disposed of are valued to reflect Open Market Value. Valuations are carried
out by internal and external qualified surveyors who are members of the Royal
Institution of Chartered Surveyors or, in the case of some overseas properties,
locally qualified valuers.

(1)  Group undertakings and properties being realised at balance sheet values.

roll-over relief, it is considered that no useful purpose would be served

Ordinary shares
</P>
<P>
In July 2001, in order to finance the Mellon acquisition, 140 million ordinary
shares were allotted in exchange for 100% of the equity and preference share
capital of a newly formed subsidiary company, and placed in the market at a
price of (pound)14.75. The proceeds of the placing, totalling (pound)2,065
million before expenses of (pound)23 million, were paid to the Company by way
of redemption of the subsidiary company's preference shares. The closing market
price of the Company's ordinary shares on the day of the placing was
<BR>
(pound)15.09.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the following issues of ordinary shares were made during the year
to 31 December 2001:
</P>
<P>
(a)  7.0 million ordinary shares following the exercise of options under the
Company's executive, sharesave and option 2000 schemes and a further 11.7
million ordinary shares in respect of the exercise of options under the
NatWest executive and sharesave schemes which had been exchanged for
options over the Company's shares following the acquisition of NatWest;
<BR>
(b)  19.0 million ordinary shares in lieu of cash in respect of the final
dividend for the 15 months ended 31 December 2000 and the interim dividend
for the year ended 31 December 2001; and
<BR>
(c)  3.6 million ordinary shares under the Company's profit sharing (share
ownership) scheme.
</P>
<P>
The total consideration for ordinary shares issued during the period amounted
to (pound)2,641 million.
</P>
<P>
During the year to 31 December 2001, options were granted over 24.9 million
ordinary shares under the Company's executive, sharesave and option 2000
schemes. At 31 December 2001, options granted under the Company's various
schemes exercisable up to 2011 at prices ranging from 246 pence to 1718 pence
per share, were outstanding in respect of 65.5 million ordinary shares. In
addition, options granted under the NatWest schemes were outstanding in respect
of 24.7 million ordinary shares exercisable up to 2009 at prices ranging from
318 pence to 924 pence per share. The Group has taken advantage of the
exemption in UITF 17 'Employee share schemes' applicable to SAYE schemes, and
accordingly no cost has been recognised on the grant of sharesave options.
</P>

<SPAN STYLE="font-weight: bold">
Additional Value Shares
</SPAN>
</P>
<P>
Approximately 2.7 billion Additional Value Shares (&quot;AVS&quot;) with a total nominal
value of (pound)27 million were issued to shareholders by way of a bonus issue
in July 2000 in connection with the acquisition of NatWest.
</P>
<P>
Each AVS is expected to attract dividends, at the discretion of the directors,
in aggregate of (pound)1 per share. A dividend of 15 pence per AVS was paid on
3 December 2001 and future dividends, if declared, are due to be paid as
follows: 30 pence per AVS on 1 December 2002 and 55 pence per AVS on 1 December
2003.
</P>
<P>
If on or before 1 December 2003 aggregate dividends of (pound)1 per AVS have
not been paid, the AVS will convert into ordinary shares and reasonable efforts
will be made to procure bids so as to result in the proceeds from the sale of
which ordinary shares to bring the amount per AVS equal to (pound)1 less the
aggregate amount of any dividend paid in respect of each AVS.

In June 2001, the Company issued 16 million Series K non-cumulative preference
shares of US$0.01 each at US$25 per share, the net proceeds being US$387

</P>
<P>
In January 2002, the Company redeemed the 600 million non-cumulative

In 1997, the Group established a Qualifying Employee Share Ownership Trust
('QUEST') for the purposes of delivering shares on the exercise of options
under the sharesave scheme. During the year ended 31 December 2001, the Group
received (pound)221 million (15 months ended 31 December 2000 - (pound)225
million) on the issue of 13.5 million shares (15 months ended 31 December 2000
<BR>
- 19.8 million shares) in respect of options under the sharesave scheme.
Employees paid (pound)58 million (15 months ended 31 December 2000 - (pound)64
million) to the Group for the issue of these shares. A transfer of (pound)163
million (15 months ended 31 December 2000 - (pound)161 million) has been made
from the profit and loss account reserves to the share premium account in
respect of this transaction.
</P>
<P>
At 31 December 2001, 816,254 shares were held by the QUEST and are included in
Other assets at an amount which reflects the share price of the options that
the shares are expected to be used to satisfy.
</P>
<P>
Exchange losses of (pound)27 million (15 months 31 December ended 2000 - losses
<BR>
(pound)123 million) arising on foreign currency borrowings have been offset in
the Group's profit and loss account reserves against differences on
retranslating the net investment in overseas subsidiary and associated
undertakings financed by these borrowings.
</P>
<P>
The tax effect of gains and losses taken directly to reserves was (pound)1
million charge (15 months ended 31 December 2000 - (pound)2 million charge).

Perpetual regulatory tier one securities (&quot;PROs&quot;)
</P>
<P>
In August 2001, the Company issued 1.2 million Series 1 PROs at US$1,000 per
security, the net proceeds being US$1,188 million. These securities are
classified as non-equity shareholders' funds.
</P>
<P>
The PROs have no maturity date and are not redeemable at the option of the
holders at any time. The Company has the option to redeem the securities on or
after 30 September 2031 or on any interest payment date thereafter or at any
time on the occurrence of certain events. No redemption of the PROs may be made
by the Company without the prior consent of the UK Financial Services
Authority.
</P>
<P>
Interest on the PROs is payable semi-annually in arrears at a fixed rate of
7.648% per annum until 30 September 2031 and thereafter quarterly in arrears at
a variable rate of 2.5% per annum above three month dollar LIBOR. The Company
can satisfy interest payment obligations by issuing ordinary shares to
appointed Trustees in an amount intended to be sufficient to enable them, on
selling these shares, to settle the interest payment.

38.  Derivatives
</P>
<P>
In the normal course of business, the Group enters into a variety of derivative
transactions principally in the foreign exchange and interest rate markets.
These are used to provide financial services to customers and to take, hedge
and modify positions as part of trading activities. Derivatives are also used
to hedge or modify risk exposures arising on the balance sheet from a variety
of activities including lending and securities investment.
</P>
<P>
The principal types of derivative contracts into which the Group enters are
described below.
</P>
<P>
Swaps
<BR>
These are over-the-counter (&quot;OTC&quot;) agreements between two parties to exchange
periodic payments of interest, or payments for the change in value of a
commodity, or related index, over a set period based on notional principal
amounts. The Group enters into swap transactions in several markets. Interest
rate swaps exchange fixed rates for floating rates of interest based on
notional amounts. Basis swaps exchange floating or fixed interest calculated
using different bases. Cross currency swaps are the exchange of interest based
on notional values of different currencies. Equity and commodity swaps exchange
interest for the return on an equity or commodity, or equity or commodity
index.
</P>
<P>
Options
<BR>
Currency and interest rate options confer the right, but not the obligation, on
the buyer to receive or pay a specific quantity of an asset or financial
instrument for a specified price at or before a specified date. Options may be
exchange traded or OTC agreements. The Group principally buys and sells
currency and interest rate options.
</P>
<P>
Futures and forwards
<BR>
Short-term interest rate futures, bond futures and forward foreign exchange
contracts are all agreements to deliver, or take delivery of, a specified
amount of an asset or financial instrument based on the specified rate, price
or index applied against the underlying asset or financial instrument, at a
specified date. Futures are exchange traded at standardised amounts of the
underlying asset or financial instrument. Forward contracts are OTC agreements
and are principally dealt in by the Group in interest rates as forward rate
agreements and in currency as forward foreign exchange contracts.
</P>
<P>
Collateral
<BR>
The Group may require collateral in respect of the credit risk in derivative
transactions. The amount of credit risk is principally the positive fair value
of contracts. Collateral may be in the form of cash or in the form of a lien
over a customer's assets entitling the Group to make a claim for current and
future liabilities.

38.  Derivatives (continued)
</P>
<P>
Maturity of replacement cost of over-the-counter contracts (trading and
non-trading)
</P>
<P>
Replacement cost indicates the Group's derivatives credit exposure. The
following table sets forth the gross positive fair values by maturity. The net
replacement cost of internal trades is not included as there is no credit risk
associated with them.

The Group's objectives and policies in managing the risks that arise in
connection with the use of financial instruments are set out under 'Risk
management' on pages 117 to 126, 'Financial Instruments' on page 126 and
'Derivatives' on page 127.

Interest rate sensitivity gap
</P>
<P>
The tables below summarise the Group's interest rate sensitivity gap for its
non-trading book at 31 December 2001 and 31 December 2000. The tables show the
contractual re-pricing for each category of asset, liability and for
off-balance sheet items. A liability (or negative) gap position exists when
liabilities reprice more quickly or in greater proportion than assets during a
given period and tends to benefit net interest income in a declining interest
rate environment. An asset (or positive) gap position exists when assets
reprice more quickly or in greater proportion than liabilities during a given
period and tends to benefit net interest income in a rising interest rate
environment. Contractual repricing terms do not reflect the potential impact of
early repayment or withdrawal. Positions may not be reflective of those in
subsequent periods. Major changes in positions can be made promptly as market
outlooks change. In addition, significant variations in interest rate
sensitivity may exist within the re-pricing periods presented and among the
currencies in which the Group has interest rate positions.

<P>
Fair values of financial instruments
</P>
<P>
The following tables set out the fair values of the Group's financial
instruments. Fair value is the amount at which an instrument could be exchanged
in a current transaction between willing parties, other than in a forced or
liquidation sale. Quoted market values are used where available; otherwise,
fair values have been estimated based on discounted expected future cash flows
and other valuation techniques. These techniques involve uncertainties and
require assumptions and judgements covering prepayments, credit risk and
discount rates. Changes in these assumptions would significantly affect
estimated fair values. The fair values reported would not necessarily be
realised in an immediate sale; nor are there plans to settle liabilities prior
to contractual maturity. As there is a wide range of valuation techniques, it
may be inappropriate to compare the Group's fair value information to
independent markets or other financial institutions' fair value.

Notes:
<BR>
1   Financial assets and financial liabilities carried at fair value or where
carrying value approximates to fair value because they are of short
maturity or repricing date.
<BR>
2   Fair values of derivatives are determined by market prices where available.
Otherwise fair value is based on current market information using
appropriate valuation models.
<BR>
3   The fair value of deposits repayable on demand is equal to their carrying
value. The fair values of term deposits and time certificates of deposit
are estimated by discounting expected future cash flows using rates
currently offered for deposits of similar remaining maturities.
<BR>
4   For loans which reprice frequently or are linked to the Group's base rate,
and for which there has been no significant change in credit risk since
inception, carrying value represents a reasonable estimate of fair value.
For other loans, fair values are estimated by discounting expected future
cash flows, using current interest rates appropriate to the type of loan,
and making adjustments for credit risk.
<BR>
5   Fair values of marketable securities are based on quoted market prices.
Where these are unavailable, fair value is estimated using other valuation
techniques.
<BR>
6   The fair value of short-term debt securities in issue is approximately
equal to their carrying value. The fair value of other debt securities in
issue is based on quoted market prices where available, or where these are
unavailable, is estimated using other valuation techniques.
<BR>
7   The fair value of loan capital, non-equity minority interests and
preference shares is based on quoted market prices where available. For
unquoted loan capital, fair value has been estimated using other valuation
techniques.
<BR>
8   Fair values are not given for financial commitments and contingent
liabilities. The diversity of the fee structures, the lack of an
established market and the difficulty of separating the value of the
instruments from the value of the overall relationship involve such
uncertainty that it is not meaningful to provide an estimate of their fair
value. (The principal amounts of these instruments are given in Note 40).

Hedges

<P>
As described in the accounting policies on pages 138 and 139, derivatives and
debt securities held for hedging purposes are accounted for in accordance with
the treatment of the hedged transaction. As a result any gains or losses on the
hedging instrument arising from changes in fair values are not recognised in
the profit and loss account immediately but are accounted for in the same
manner as the hedged item.

<P>
Acceptances are obligations to pay on maturity the face value of a bill of
exchange to a third party. Most acceptances are short-term and extend for one
year or less. By endorsing a document, the Group accepts liability for payment
if it is dishonoured.
</P>
<P>
Documentary credits are commercial letters of credit providing for payment by
the Group to a named beneficiary against delivery of specified documents.
</P>
<P>
Commitments to lend include commitments which are unconditionally cancellable
and agreements to lend to a customer so long as all conditions established in
the loan agreement have been satisfied or waived. A substantial proportion of
the Group's loans is by way of overdrafts. Unutilised overdraft facilities
constitute commitments to lend which, although unconditionally cancellable, are
normally granted for a specific period of time. Unutilised overdraft facilities
are included in commitments to lend.
</P>
<P>
Other commitments and contingent obligations usually have fixed expiry dates or
other termination clauses.
</P>
<P>
Banking commitments and contingent obligations which have been entered into on
behalf of customers and for which there are corresponding obligations by
customers are not included in assets and liabilities. The Group's maximum
exposure to credit loss, in the event of non-performance by the other party
where all counterclaims, collateral or security prove valueless, is represented
by the contractual notional amount of those instruments. Many commitments are
expected to expire without being drawn and do not necessarily represent future
cash requirements.
</P>
<P>
Litigation Members of the Group are engaged in litigation in the United Kingdom
and a number of overseas jurisdictions, including the US, involving claims by
and against them which arise in the ordinary course of business. The directors
of the Company, after reviewing the claims pending and threatened against Group
undertakings and taking into account the advice of the relevant legal advisers,
are satisfied that the outcome of these claims will not have a material adverse
effect on the net assets of the Group.

(1)  Revaluations reflect the restatement of loans and deposits to their
estimated fair values at the date of acquisition, and the related tax
effect.
<BR>
(2)  Accounting policy alignments reflect the adoption of Group accounting
policies in respect of provisioning for loans and advances, together with
the related tax effects.
<BR>
(3)  The goodwill arising on acquisition is being amortised over its estimated
economic life of 20 years, resulting in a charge of US$118 million
((pound)83 million) per annum.

41.   Acquisitions (continued)
</P>
<P>
National Westminster Bank Plc and its subsidiaries
</P>
<P>
The Group acquired NatWest on 6 March 2000. Estimated fair values were assigned
to the assets and liabilities of NatWest for inclusion in the Group's 2000
financial statements. Final adjustments, shown in the table below, to those
provisional fair values have now been made. As a result, goodwill on
acquisition has increased by (pound)93 million to (pound)11,483 million.

Notes:
<BR>
(1)  Revaluations - adjustments have been made to the fair values assigned
provisionally to NatWest's financial instruments and its property
portfolio in the light of further detailed reviews. As a result, the fair
values of certain asset and liability categories detailed above have been
reduced.
<BR>
(2)  Accounting policy alignments - application of Group accounting policy in
respect of insurance commissions following additional analysis of historic
customer behaviour increased Other liabilities by (pound)9 million.
<BR>
(3)  Other adjustments - changes to provisions recognised in 2000 as further
evidence became available about conditions at the date of acquisition
decreased Other liabilities by (pound)53 million.

48.   Segmental analysis
</P>
<P>
In the tables below, the analyses of net assets are included in compliance with
Statement of Standard Accounting Practice 25 'Segmental reporting'. The
fungible nature of liabilities within the banking industry results in
allocations of liabilities which, in some cases, are necessarily subjective.
The directors believe that it is more meaningful to analyse total assets and
the result of this analysis is therefore also included in the tables.

arrangements and agreements entered into by authorised institutions in the
Group were (pound)37,127,866 in respect of loans to 18 persons who were
directors of the Company (or persons connected with them) at any time
during the financial period and (pound)20,177 to one person who was an
officer of the Company at any time during the financial period.

(b)  Sir George Mathewson, Chairman of the Company, RBS plc and NWB Plc, had a
right to repurchase from RBS plc his former dwellinghouse which RBS plc
purchased from him and his wife in May 1988 at a price of (pound)125,000.
Any repurchase was to be at the higher of the purchase price paid by RBS
plc or a price determined by independent professional valuation at the time
of exercise of the right to repurchase. The right to repurchase became

2001 are shown in Note 26 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. These
transactions are conducted on similar terms to third party transactions and are
not material to the Group's results or financial condition. Certain subsidiary
undertakings in the Group provide development and other types of capital
support to businesses in their roles as providers of finance. These investments
are made in the normal course of business and on arm's-length terms depending
on their nature. In some instances, the investment may extend to ownership or
control over 20% or more of the voting rights of the investee company. However,
these investments are not considered to give rise to transactions of a
materiality requiring disclosure under FRS 8.

<P>
52.  Significant differences between UK and US generally accepted accounting
principles
</P>
<P>
The Consolidated Financial Statements of the Group are prepared in accordance
with UK generally accepted accounting principles (&quot;GAAP&quot;) which differs in
certain material respects from US GAAP. The main differences are summarised as
follows:
</P>
<P>
(a) Acquisition accounting. Under UK GAAP, all integration costs relating to
acquisitions are expensed as post-acquisition expenses. Under US GAAP, certain
restructuring costs and exit costs incurred in the acquired business are
treated as liabilities assumed on acquisition and taken into account in the
calculation of goodwill.
</P>
<P>
The fair value of the surplus on pension schemes is restricted under UK GAAP to
the amount expected to be realised by way of reduced contributions or refunds.
Under US GAAP, the full surplus is recognised as a fair value adjustment.
</P>
<P>
Under US GAAP, the consideration for the acquisition includes the value of
certain options granted to holders of options over the acquired entity's shares
under employee share option schemes.
</P>
<P>
Under UK GAAP, provisional fair value adjustments made in the accounting year
in which the acquisition occurs may be amended in the subsequent accounting
year. Under US GAAP, the allocation of the cost of acquisition to the fair
values of assets and liabilities is generally completed within 12 months of the
date of acquisition.
</P>
<P>
(b) Goodwill. Under the Group's accounting policy, goodwill arising on
acquisitions after 1 October 1998 is capitalised on the balance sheet and
amortised on a straight-line basis over its estimated useful economic life.
Goodwill arising on acquisitions before 1 October 1998 was deducted from
reserves immediately. Under US GAAP, goodwill on acquisitions completed before
30 June 2001 is amortised over the period estimated to benefit, which, in the
Group's case, is periods of up to 25 years. Under the transitional provisions
of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (&quot;SFAS&quot;) 142 'Goodwill and Other
Intangible Assets', goodwill arising on acquisitions completed after 30 June
2001 is not amortised.
</P>
<P>
(c) Revaluation. The Group's freehold and leasehold property is carried at
original cost or subsequent valuation. The surplus or deficit on revaluation is
included in the Group's reserves. Under US GAAP, revaluations of property are
not permitted to be reflected in the financial statements.
</P>
<P>
(d) Depreciation. Depreciation charged under UK GAAP is based on the revalued
amount of freehold and long leasehold properties; no depreciation is charged on
investment properties. Prior to 1 October 1999 no depreciation was charged on
any properties. Under US GAAP, the depreciation charge is based on the
historical cost of all properties.
</P>
<P>
(e) Dividends. Under UK GAAP, dividends are recorded in the period to which they
relate, whereas under US GAAP dividends are recorded in the period in which
they are declared.
</P>

<A NAME="eolPage186"></A>
<P>
52.  Significant differences between UK and US generally accepted accounting
principles (continued)
</P>
<P>
(f) Loan origination fees. Certain loan fees are recognised when received. Under
US GAAP, all loan fees and certain direct costs are deferred and recognised as
an adjustment to the yield on the related loan or facility.
</P>
<P>
(g) Pension costs. Pension costs, based on actuarial assumptions and methods,
are charged in the consolidated accounts so as to allocate the cost of
providing benefits over the service lives of employees in a consistent manner
approved by the actuary. US GAAP prescribes the method of actuarial valuation
and also requires assets to be assessed at fair value and the assessment of
liabilities to be based on current interest rates.
</P>
<P>
(h) Long-term assurance business. The shareholders' interest in the long-term
assurance fund is valued as the discounted value of the cash flows expected to
be generated from in-force policies together with net assets in excess of the
statutory liabilities. Under US GAAP, for traditional business, premiums are
recognised as revenue when due from the policyholders. Costs of claims are
recognised when insured events occur. A liability for future policy benefits is
established based upon the present value of future benefits less the present
value of future net premiums. Acquisition costs for traditional business
contracts are charged to the profit and loss account in proportion to premium
revenue recognised. For unit-linked business, premiums and front-end load-type
charges receivable from customers and acquisition costs relating to the
acquisition of new contracts are capitalised and depreciated in proportion to
the present value of estimated gross profits. Costs of claims are recognised
when insured events occur.
</P>
<P>
(i) Leasing. In accordance with UK GAAP, the Group's accounting policy for
finance lease income receivable is to allocate total gross earnings to
accounting periods so as to give a constant periodic rate of return on the net
cash investment, and certain operating lease assets are depreciated on a
reverse-annuity basis. Under US GAAP, finance lease income is recognised so as
to give a level rate of return on the investment in the lease but without
taking into account the associated tax flows, and all operating lease assets
are depreciated on a straight-line basis.
</P>
<P>
(j) Debt securities and equity shares. Under UK GAAP, the Group's investments in
debt securities and equity shares are classified as being held as investment
securities, held for the purpose of hedging or held for dealing purposes.
Investment securities are stated at cost less provision for any permanent
diminution in value. Premiums and discounts on dated securities are amortised
to interest income over the period to maturity. Under US GAAP, the Group's
investment debt securities and marketable investment equity shares are
classified as available-for-sale securities with unrealised gains and losses
reported in a separate component of shareholders' equity.
</P>
<P>
(k) Derivatives and hedging activities. SFAS 133 'Accounting for Derivative
Instruments and Hedging Activities' was effective for the Group's US GAAP
information from 1 January 2001. The Group has not made changes in its use of
non-trading derivatives to meet the hedge criteria of SFAS 133. As a result,
from 1 January 2001, for US GAAP purposes, the Group's portfolio of non-trading
derivatives has been remeasured to fair value and changes in fair value
reflected in net income. Under UK GAAP, these derivatives continue to be
classified as non-trading and accounted for in accordance with the underlying
transaction or transactions. The Group's UK and US GAAP reconciliations also
reflect transition adjustments on initial application of SFAS 133. These
adjustments are: a cumulative-effect-type adjustment increasing net income by
<BR>
(pound)45 million ((pound)65 million less tax of (pound)20 million); and a
cumulative-effect-type adjustment decreasing other comprehensive income by
<BR>
(pound)51 million ((pound)73 million less tax of (pound)22 million).
</P>
<P>
(l) Software development costs. Under UK GAAP, most software development costs
are written off as incurred. Under US GAAP, certain costs relating to software
developed for own use that are incurred after 1 January 1999 are capitalised
and depreciated over the estimated useful life of the software.
</P>
<P>
(m) Deferred taxation. Deferred taxation is provided only where it is probable
that a taxation liability will crystallise and is calculated at rates expected
to be applicable when the liabilities or assets are expected to crystallise.
Under US GAAP, deferred taxation is recognised on all temporary differences.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted rates in effect
for the year in which the differences are expected to be recovered or settled.
</P>
<P>
(n) Acceptances. Acceptances outstanding and the matching customers' liabilities
are not reflected in the consolidated balance sheet, but are disclosed as
memorandum items. Under US GAAP, acceptances outstanding and the matching
customers' liabilities are reflected in the consolidated balance sheet.
</P>
<P>
(o) Offset of repurchase and reverse repurchase agreements. Under UK GAAP, debit
and credit balances with the same counterparty are aggregated into a single
item where there is a right to insist on net settlement and the debit balance
matures no later than the credit balance. Under US GAAP, repurchase and reverse
repurchase agreements with the same counterparty may be offset only where they
have the same settlement date specified at inception.
</P>
<P>
(p) Year 2000 costs. Under UK GAAP, expenditure on Year 2000 compliance has been
set against provisions raised in 1997. Under US GAAP, such costs are charged as
incurred.

52.  Significant differences between UK and US generally accepted accounting
principles (continued)
</P>
<P>
Recent developments in US GAAP. In June 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards
Board (&quot;FASB&quot;) issued SFAS 141 'Business Combinations'. SFAS 141 requires all
business combinations initiated after 30 June 2001 to be accounted for using
the purchase accounting method, specifies how goodwill and other intangible
assets should be measured on initial recognition, and sets out disclosure
requirements relating to business combinations.
</P>
<P>
In June 2001, the FASB issued SFAS 142 'Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets'.
The main provisions of SFAS 142, effective for the Group's 2002 financial
statements, state how goodwill and other intangible assets should be accounted
for subsequent to acquisition and specifies that goodwill should not be
amortised but tested for impairment at least annually. Under the transitional
provisions of SFAS 142, goodwill arising on acquisitions completed after 30
June 2001 is not amortised.
</P>
<P>
In June 2001, the FASB issued SFAS 143 'Accounting for Asset Retirement
Obligations'. SFAS 143 sets out requirements for the accounting treatment of
obligations associated with the retirement of long-lived assets, and is
effective for the Group's 2003 financial statements.
</P>
<P>
In August 2001, the FASB issued SFAS 144 'Accounting for the Impairment or
Disposal of Long-Lived Assets'. SFAS 144 amends existing requirements for the
recognition and measurement of impairment losses relating to long-lived assets,
and the accounting treatment of long-lived assets that are to be disposed of,
and is effective for the Group's 2002 financial statements.
</P>
<P>
The Group is reviewing each of these statements to determine their effect on
its US GAAP reporting.
</P>
<P>
Selected figures in accordance with US GAAP
</P>
<P>
The following tables summarise the significant adjustments to consolidated net
income, comprehensive income and shareholders' equity which result from the
application of US GAAP instead of UK GAAP. Where applicable, the adjustments
are stated gross of tax with the tax effect shown separately in total.

2000, the date of acquisition of NatWest, the National Westminster Bank Pension
Fund (the &quot;plans&quot;). These plans cover most of the Group's UK employees and the
impact of US GAAP on the other Group schemes is considered to be immaterial. A
trust fund has been established under each plan, to which payments are made,
determined on an actuarial basis, designed to build up reserves during the
working life of full-time employees to pay such employees or dependants a
pension after retirement. Such pensions are based on final pensionable salaries
and are related to the length of service prior to retirement. Pensions are
limited to a maximum of two-thirds of final salary for 40 years service or
more. Staff do not make contributions for basic pensions but may make voluntary
contributions on a regular basis to purchase additional service qualification
where less than 40 years service will have been completed by normal retirement
age. The assets of the plans are held under separate trusts and, in the
long-term, the funding policy is to maintain assets sufficient to cover the
benefits in respect of service to date, with due allowance for future earnings
increases. The plan assets consist mainly of fixed-income securities and listed
securities. The investment policy followed for the plans seeks to deploy the
plan assets primarily in UK and overseas equity shares and UK government
securities.

The Group enters into securities repurchase agreements and securities lending
transactions under which it receives or transfers cash or securities as
collateral in accordance with normal market practice. At 31 December 2001,
securities to the value of (pound)27.4 billion (31 December 2000 - (pound)21.3
billion) transferred under repurchase transactions were included within the
securities on the balance sheet, of which (pound)23.7 billion (31 December 2000

- (pound)18.9 billion) were securities which the holder could resell or
repledge. Securities received as collateral under reverse repurchase agreements
amounted to (pound)35.5 billion (31 December 2000 - (pound)22.7 billion), of
which (pound)22.6 billion (31 December 2000 - (pound)18.5 billion) had been

Accounting for income taxes
</P>
<P>
Under SFAS 109, 'Accounting for Income Taxes', deferred tax balances should be
calculated using the full provision liability method, and a deferred tax asset
may only be recognised if management's judgement is that redemption of the
deferred tax asset is more likely than not. The components of the net US GAAP
deferred tax liability calculated in accordance with SFAS 109 at 31 December
2001 and 31 December 2000 are summarised below:

Notes
<BR>
1.   The main components of the tax charge attributable to continuing
operations are shown in Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
</P>
<P>
2.   The valuation allowance relates primarily to unrelieved tax losses.
</P>
<P>
Loan impairment
</P>
<P>
With effect from 1 October 1995, the Group adopted SFAS 114 'Accounting by
Creditors for Impairment of a Loan' and the subsequent amendment SFAS 118
'Accounting by Creditors for Impairment of a Loan - Income Recognition and
Disclosures' for US GAAP purposes. SFAS 114 applies to impaired loans only.
Under SFAS 114, a loan is considered impaired, based on current information and
events, if it is probable that a creditor will be unable to collect the
scheduled payments of principal or interest when due according to the
contractual terms of the loan agreement. The measurement of impaired loans is
primarily based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted
at the loan's effective interest rate, except for collateral dependent loans
where impairment is based on the fair value of the collateral. Smaller balance
homogeneous consumer loans, (credit card advances, residential mortgages,
consumer instalment loans, overdrafts), that are collectively evaluated for
impairment, leases and debt securities are outside the scope of SFAS 114.
</P>
<P>
At 31 December 2001 and 2000, the Group estimated that the difference between
the carrying value of its loan portfolio under SFAS 114 and its value in the
Group's UK GAAP financial statements was such that no adjustment to net income
or consolidated shareholders' equity was required.
</P>
<P>
At 31 December 2001, the Group's non-accrual loans and troubled debt
restructurings amounted to (pound)3,708 million (31 December 2000 -
<BR>
(pound)2,991 million). Specific provisions of (pound)2,395 million (31 December
2000 - (pound)2,019 million) were held against these loans. Average non-accrual
loans and troubled debt restructurings for the year to 31 December 2001 were
<BR>
(pound)3,277 million (year ended 31 December 2000 - (pound)3,083 million).
</P>
<P>
Gross interest income not recognised, but which would have been recognised
under the original terms of non-accrual and restructured loans, amounted to
<BR>
(pound)173 million for the year ended 31 December 2001 (year ended 31 December
2000 - (pound)148 million, year ended 30 September 1999 - (pound)53 million)
from domestic loans and (pound)60 million for the year ended 31 December 2001
(year ended 31 December 2000 - (pound)48 million, year ended 30 September 1999
<BR>
- (pound)32 million) from foreign loans. Interest on non-accruals and
restructured loans included in net income was (pound)42 million for the year
ended 31 December 2001 (year ended 31 December 2000 - (pound)30 million, year
ended 30 September 1999 - (pound)4 million) from domestic loans and (pound)14
million for the year ended 31 December 2001 (year ended 31 December 2000 -
<BR>
(pound)8 million, year ended 30 September 1999 - (pound)13 million) from
foreign loans.

The Group grants share options to executive officers under an executive share
option scheme (the &quot;executive scheme&quot;) and to employees under a savings-related
sharesave scheme (the &quot;savings scheme&quot;). Options granted under the executive
scheme are issued on a UK Inland Revenue approved or unapproved basis. Options
are issued at market price and are exercisable between the third and tenth
anniversaries of the grant date, only if performance criteria are met. For
options granted from 1996 to 1998, the criteria is that for the average growth
in adjusted earnings per ordinary share to exceed the average increase in the
UK Retail Prices Index by 2% per annum over a three year period. For options
granted since 1999 the relevant percentage has been increased to 3% per annum.
Under the savings plan, eligible employees can elect to exercise their options
either, three, five or seven years after the grant date.
</P>
<P>
Executive scheme
</P>
<P>
Under the terms of the executive scheme, senior management employees and
executive directors of Group companies may participate in the executive scheme
at the discretion of the Board of directors of the Company. The executive
scheme involves a participant being granted an option to subscribe for ordinary
shares of the Company at the higher of nominal value and market value of
ordinary shares on the date of grant. Options may be granted only within six
weeks after an announcement of final or interim results of the Group for any
particular year. Options may not be transferred or assigned and in normal
circumstances may be exercised only between the third and tenth anniversaries
of their grant. A participant may not be granted options over new shares to the
extent that the aggregate subscription price would exceed four times his
compensation.
</P>
<P>
Savings scheme
</P>
<P>
Under the terms of the savings scheme, employees of Group companies employed in
the UK and certain offshore jurisdictions are offered participation in the
savings scheme. The savings scheme requires the participants to make monthly
savings, under a save-as-you-earn contract (the &quot;savings contract&quot;), for a
period of three or five years, of amounts between (pound)10 and (pound)250 per
month. Options may be granted at not less than 80% of the average market value
of ordinary shares of the Company by reference to dealings in the ordinary
shares over the last three trading days of the week immediately preceding the
date of an invitation to participate, or, if higher, at par. Options comprise,
as nearly as possible, such number of ordinary shares as may be purchased at
the option price with the proceeds on maturity after either three, five or
seven years of the savings contract, and options may normally be exercised only
within six months after the third, fifth or seventh anniversary of the savings
contract. Options can only be exercised on completion of a minimum three years
of monthly savings. Options may not be transferred or assigned and may be
granted only within six weeks after an announcement of final or interim results
of the Group for any particular year.
</P>
<P>
Limitations of the executive and savings schemes:
</P>
<P>
(i)     During a ten year period, no more than 10% in aggregate of the issued
ordinary share capital of the Company from time to time may be issued
pursuant to all of the employee share schemes operated by the Company.
<BR>
(ii)    During a five year period, no more than 5% in aggregate of the issued
ordinary share capital of the Company from time to time may be issued
pursuant to all of the employee share schemes operated by the Company.
<BR>
(iii)   During a ten year period, no more than 5% in aggregate of the issued
ordinary share capital of the Company from time to time may be issued
pursuant to the executive scheme.
<BR>
(iv)    During a four year period, no more than 2 1/2% in aggregate of the
issued ordinary share capital of the Company from time to time may be
issued pursuant to the executive scheme.
<BR>
(v)     During a three year period, no more than 3% in aggregate of the issued
ordinary share capital of the Company from time to time may be issued
pursuant to the executive scheme.

On 9 August 2000 and again on 4 April 2001, every qualifying permanent member
of staff in the Group received an option over 150 shares in the Company. The
options were granted at a price of (pound)12.40 and (pound)15.63 respectively.
They are exercisable between 9 August 2003 and 8 August 2006 and between 4
April 2004 and 3 April 2007 respectively. The executive directors of the
Company waived their entitlement to the option granted on 4 April 2001.

*As a result of the bonus issue of Additional Value Shares to all ordinary
shareholders in July 2000, the number of options in issue was increased to
compensate option holders for the dilution that would have occurred to their
existing options. The exercise price of all options was reduced so that the
total exercise cost of options held remained the same.
</P>
<P>
The following table shows options outstanding at 31 December 2001, 31 December
2000 and 30 September 1999 by normal exercise date. An option life of 5 years,
being the midpoint on the 10-year option, has been assumed for options granted
under the RBS and NatWest executive plans.

issue of ordinary shares at the option of the Company and have not been
included in the computation of diluted earnings per share as their effect
is also anti-dilutive.
