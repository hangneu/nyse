	Eurozone, the economic prospects of the United States and the future economic growth of China, Brazil, Russia, India and other emerging markets are all expected to affect demand for product and
	crude tankers going-forward. Demand for oil and refined petroleum products remains weak as a result of the weak global economic environment and a general global trend towards energy efficient technologies, which in combination with the diminished
	availability of trade credit and deteriorating international liquidity conditions, led to decreased demand for tanker vessels, creating downward pressure on charter rates. This economic downturn has also affected vessel values overall. Energy prices
	sharply declined from mid-2014 to mid-February 2016 primarily as a result of increased oil production worldwide. In response to this increased production, demand for tankers to move oil and refined petroleum products increased significantly and
	average spot and period charter rates for product and crude tankers rose, and continue to be, at above historically average rates. If oil demand grows in the future, it is expected to come primarily from emerging markets which have been historically
	volatile, such as China and India, and a slowdown in these countries&#146; economies may severely affect global oil demand growth, and may result in protracted, reduced consumption of oil products and a decreased demand for our vessels and lower
	charter rates, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows, financial condition and ability to make cash distributions. Should OPEC significantly reduce oil production or should there be significant
	declines in non-OPEC oil production, that may result in a protracted period of reduced oil shipments and a decreased demand for our vessels and lower charter rates, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations,
	cash flows, financial condition and ability to make cash distributions.

	Historically, the crude oil markets have been volatile as a
	result of the many conditions and events that can affect the price, demand, production and transport of oil, including competition from alternative energy sources. Decreased demand for oil transportation may have a material adverse effect on our
	revenues, cash flows and profitability. The factors affecting the supply and demand for tankers are outside of our control, and the nature, timing and degree of changes in industry conditions are unpredictable. The continuing global financial crisis

	848 since January 2015 and stood at 528 as of February&nbsp;17, 2016. Of note is that Chinese imports of crude oil have steadily increased from three million barrels per day in 2008 to an all-time record of about 7.8&nbsp;million barrels per day in
	December 2015 and the U.S. has steadily increased its total petroleum product exports by about 370% to 4.4&nbsp;million barrels per day in November 2015 from one million barrels per day in January 2006. If the tanker sector of the seaborne

	China imports significant quantities of crude oil and trades significant quantities of petroleum products. For example in 2015, China imported
	about 305&nbsp;million tons of crude oil by sea compared with crude oil imports to the United States of about 231&nbsp;million tons. Our tanker vessels are deployed by our charterers on routes involving crude oil and petroleum product trades in and
	out of emerging markets, and our charterers&#146; oil shipping and business revenue may be derived from the shipment of goods within and to the Asia Pacific region from various overseas export markets. Any reduction in or hindrance to China-based
	importers could have a material adverse effect on the growth rate of China&#146;s imports and on our charterers&#146; business. For instance, the government of China has implemented economic policies aimed at reducing pollution, increasing the
	strategic stock piling of crude oil and increasing the amounts of diesel oil available for export. Should these policies change, this may have the effect of reducing crude oil imports or petroleum product exports and may, in turn, result in a
	decrease in demand for oil shipping. Additionally, though in China there is an increasing level of autonomy and a gradual shift in emphasis to a &#147;market economy&#148; and enterprise reform, many of the reforms, particularly some limited price
	reforms that result in the prices for certain commodities being principally determined by market forces, are unprecedented or experimental and may be subject to revision, change or abolition. The level of imports to and exports from China could be

	Our operations expose us to the risk that increased trade protectionism from China or other nations will adversely affect our business. If the
	global recovery is undermined by downside risks and the recent economic downturn returns, governments may turn to trade barriers to protect their domestic industries against foreign imports, thereby depressing the demand for shipping. Specifically,
	increasing trade protectionism in the markets that our charterers serve may cause (i)&nbsp;a decrease in cargoes available to our charterers in favor of Chinese charterers and Chinese owned ships and (ii)&nbsp;an increase in the risks associated
	with importing goods to China. Any increased trade barriers or restrictions on trade, especially trade with China, would have an adverse impact on our charterers&#146; business, operating results and financial condition and could thereby affect
	their ability to make timely charter hire payments to us and to renew and increase the number of their time charters with us.

	S.A. together with a number of commodities traders, represent a significant percentage of the production, trading and shipping logistics (terminals) of crude oil and refined products worldwide. Concerns for the environment have led the oil majors to
	develop and implement a strict ongoing due diligence process when selecting their commercial partners. This vetting process has evolved into a sophisticated and comprehensive risk assessment of both the vessel operator and the vessel, including
	physical ship inspections, completion of vessel inspection questionnaires performed by accredited inspectors and the production of comprehensive risk assessment reports. In the case of term charter relationships, additional factors are considered

	As of March&nbsp;17, 2016, the vessels in our fleet had an average age of approximately 5.0
	years and most tanker vessels have an expected life of approximately 25 years. We may acquire older vessels in the future. Older vessels are typically more costly to maintain than more recently constructed vessels due to improvements in engine
	technology. In some instances, charterers prefer newer vessels that are more fuel efficient than older vessels. Cargo insurance rates also increase with the age of a vessel, making older vessels less desirable to charterers as well. Governmental
	regulations, safety or other equipment standards related to the age of the vessels may require expenditures for alterations or the addition of new equipment, to our vessels and may restrict the type of activities in which these vessels may engage.
	We cannot assure you that as our vessels age, market conditions will justify those expenditures or enable us to operate our vessels profitably during the remainder of their useful lives. If we sell vessels, we may have to sell them at a loss, and if

	our vessels and other business assets. However, we cannot assure you that we will be able to insure against all risks adequately, that any particular claim will be paid out of our insurance, or that we will be able to procure adequate insurance
	coverage at commercially reasonable rates in the future. Our insurers also require us to pay certain deductible amounts, before they will pay claims, and insurance policies may contain limitations and exclusions, which, although we believe will be

	Additional conventions, laws and regulations may be adopted that could limit our ability to do business, require capital expenditures or
	otherwise increase our cost of doing business, which may materially adversely affect our operations, as well as the shipping industry generally. For example, in various jurisdictions, legislation has been enacted, or is under consideration, that
	would impose more stringent requirements on air pollution and effluent discharges from our vessels. For example, the International Maritime Organization (&#147;IMO&#148;) periodically proposes and adopts amendments to revise the International
	Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships (&#147;MARPOL&#148;), such as the revision to Annex VI which came into force on July&nbsp;1, 2010. The revised Annex VI implements a phased reduction of the sulfur content of fuel and allows for
	stricter sulfur limits in designated emission control areas (&#147;ECAs&#148;). Thus far, ECAs have been formally adopted for the Baltic Sea area (limits SOx emissions only); the North Sea area including the English Channel (limiting SOx emissions
	only) and the North American ECA (which came into effect on August&nbsp;1, 2012 limiting SOx, NOx and particulate matter emissions). The United States Caribbean Sea ECA entered into force on January&nbsp;1, 2013 and has been effective since
	January&nbsp;1, 2014, limiting SOx, NOx and particulate matter emissions. As of January 2015, the limit for fuel oil sulphur levels falls to 0.10% m/m in emission control areas established to limit SOx and particulate matter emissions. Outside the
	emission control areas, the current limit for sulphur content of fuel oil is 3.50%, falling to 0.50% m/m on and after January&nbsp;1, 2020. The 2020 date is subject to a review, to be completed by 2018, as to the availability of the required fuel
	oil. Depending on the outcome of the review, the effective date could be deferred to January&nbsp;1, 2025. Similarly MARPOL Annex VI requires Tier III standards for NOx emissions to be applied to ships constructed and engines installed in ships
	operating in NOx emission control areas from January&nbsp;1, 2016.

	Environmental legislation in the United States merits particular mention as it is in many respects more onerous than international laws,
	representing a high-water mark of regulation with which ship owners and operators must comply, and of liability likely to be incurred in the event of non-compliance or an incident causing pollution. Such regulation may become even stricter if laws
	are changed as a result of the April 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico. In the United States, the OPA establishes an extensive regulatory and liability regime for the protection and cleanup of the environment from cargo and
	bunker oil spills from vessels, including tankers. The OPA covers all owners and operators whose vessels trade in the United States, its territories and possessions or whose vessels operate in United States waters, which includes the United
	States&#146; territorial sea and its 200 nautical mile exclusive economic zone (the &#147;EEZ&#148;). Under the OPA, vessel owners, operators and bareboat charterers are &#147;responsible parties&#148; and are jointly, severally and strictly liable
	(unless the spill results solely from the act or omission of a third party, an act of God or an act of war) for all containment and clean-up costs and other damages arising from discharges or substantial threats of discharges, of oil from their
	vessels. In response to the 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil incident in the Gulf of Mexico, the U.S. House of Representatives passed and the U.S. Senate considered but did not pass a bill to strengthen certain requirements of the OPA; similar legislation

	In recent years, the EU has become increasingly active in the field of regulation of maritime safety and protection of the environment. In
	some areas of regulation the EU has introduced new laws without attempting to procure a corresponding amendment to international law. Notably, in 2005 the EU adopted a directive, as amended in 2009, on ship-source pollution, imposing criminal
	sanctions for pollution not only where pollution is caused by intent or recklessness (which would be an offence under MARPOL), but also where it is caused by &#147;serious negligence.&#148; The concept of &#147;serious negligence&#148; may be

	In addition, while the emissions of greenhouse gases from international shipping are not subject to the Kyoto Protocol to the United Nations
	Framework Convention on Climate Change, which requires adopting countries to implement national programs to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, the IMO intends to develop limits on greenhouse gases from international shipping. It has responded to the
	global focus on climate change and greenhouse gas emissions by developing specific technical and operational efficiency measures and a work plan for market-based mechanisms in 2011. These include the mandatory measures of the ship energy efficiency
	management plan (&#147;SEEMP&#148;), outlined above, and an energy efficiency design index (&#147;EEDI&#148;) for new ships. The IMO is also considering its position on market-based measures through an expert working group. Among the numerous
	proposals being considered by the working group are the following: a port state levy based on the amount of fuel consumed by the vessel on its voyage to the port in question; a global emissions trading scheme which would allocate emissions
	allowances and set an emissions cap; and an international fund establishing a global reduction target for international shipping, to be set either by the UNFCCC or the IMO. At its 64th session (2012), the MEPC indicated that 2015 was the target year
	for Member States to identify market-based measures for international shipping. At its 66th session (2014), the MEPC continued its work on developing technical and operational measures relating to energy-efficiency measures for ships, following the
	entry into force of the mandatory efficiency measures on January&nbsp;1, 2013,. It adopted the 2014 Guidelines on the Method of Calculation of the Attained EEDI, applicable to new ships. It further adopted amendments to MARPOL Annex VI concerning
	the extension of the scope of application of the EEDI to LNG carriers, ro-ro cargo ships (vehicle carriers), ro-ro cargo ships, ro-ro passenger ships and cruise passengers ships with nonconventional propulsion. At its 67th session (2014), the MEPC
	adopted the 2014 Guidelines on survey and certification of the EEDI, updating the previous version to reference ships fitted with dual-fuel engines using LNG and liquid fuel oil. The MEPC also adopted amendments to the 2013 Interim Guidelines for
	determining minimum propulsion power to maintain the manoeuvrability of ships in adverse conditions, to make the guidelines applicable to phase 1 (starting January&nbsp;1, 2015) of the EEDI requirements. At its 68th session (2015), the MEPC agreed
	upon proposed language regarding a data collection system for fuel consumption of ships above 5,000 gross tons, a concept first proposed at MEPC 66. Further, the MEPC amended the 2014 Guidelines on EEDI survey and certification as well as the method

	During the last few years, the scope of sanctions imposed against the government of Iran and persons engaging in certain activities or doing
	certain business with and relating to Iran was expanded by a number of jurisdictions, including the United States, the European Union and Canada. In 2010, the U.S. enacted the Comprehensive Iran Sanctions Accountability and Divestment Act
	(&#147;CISADA&#148;), which expanded the scope of the former Iran Sanctions Act. The scope of U.S. sanctions against Iran were expanded subsequent to CISADA by, among other U.S. laws, the National Defense Authorization Act of 2012 (the &#147;2012
	NDAA&#148;), the Iran Threat Reduction and Syria Human Rights Act of 2012 (&#147;ITRA&#148;), Executive Order 13662, and the Iran Freedom and Counter-Proliferation Act of 2012 (&#147;IFCA&#148;). The foregoing laws, among other things, expanded the
	application of prohibitions to non-U.S. companies, such as our company, and introduced limits on the ability of companies and persons to do business or trade with Iran when such activities relate to specific activities such as investment in Iran,
	the supply or export of refined petroleum or refined petroleum products to Iran, the supply and delivery of goods to Iran which could enhance Iran&#146;s petroleum or energy sectors, and the transportation of crude oil from Iran to countries which
	do not enjoy Iran crude oil sanctions waivers (our tankers called in Iran but did not engage in the prohibited activities specifically identified by these sanctions).

	U.S. economic sanctions on Iran fall into two general categories: &#147;Primary&#148; sanctions, which prohibit U.S. citizens and U.S.
	permanent residents from engaging in all direct and indirect trade and other transactions with Iran without U.S. government authorization, and &#147;secondary&#148; sanctions, which are mainly nuclear-related sanctions. While most of the
	nuclear-related sanctions with respect to Iran were lifted on January&nbsp;16, 2016 through the implementation of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (&#147;JCPOA&#148;) entered into between the permanent members of the United Nations Security
	Council (China, France, Russia, the United Kingdom and the United States) and Germany, there are still certain limitations in place with which we need to comply. The primary sanctions with which U.S. persons or transactions with a U.S. nexus must
	comply are still in force and have not been lifted, except in a very limited fashion.

	As an international shipping company, we may operate in countries known to have a reputation for corruption. The U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices
	Act of 1977 (the &#147;FCPA&#148;) and other anti-corruption laws and regulations in applicable jurisdictions generally prohibit companies registered with the SEC and their intermediaries from making improper payments to government officials for the
	purpose of obtaining or retaining business. Under the FCPA, U.S. companies may be held liable for some actions taken by strategic or local partners or representatives. Legislation in other countries includes the U.K. Bribery Act which is broader in
	scope than the FCPA because it does not contain an exception for facilitating payments. We and our customers may be subject to these and similar anti-corruption laws in other applicable jurisdictions. Failure to comply with legal requirements could
	expose us to civil and/or criminal penalties, including fines, prosecution and significant reputational damage, all of which could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations, including our relationships with our
	customers, and our financial results. Compliance with the FCPA, the U.K. Bribery Act and other applicable anti-corruption laws and related regulations and policies imposes potentially significant costs and operational burdens on us. Moreover, the
	compliance and monitoring mechanisms that we have in place including our Code of Ethics and our anti-bribery and anti-corruption policy, may not adequately prevent or detect all possible violations under applicable anti-bribery and anti-corruption

	In addition, increased operational risks arise as a
	consequence of the complex nature of the crude oil, product and chemical tanker industry, the nature of services required to support the industry, including maintenance and repair services, and the mechanical complexity of the tankers themselves.
	Compared to other types of vessels, tankers are exposed to a higher risk of damage and loss by fire, whether ignited by a terrorist attack, collision or other cause, due to the high flammability and high volume of the oil transported in tankers.
	Damage and loss could also arise as a consequence of a failure in the services required to support the industry, for example, due to inadequate dredging. Inherent risks also arise due to the nature of the product transported by our vessels. Any
	damage to, or accident involving, our vessels while carrying crude oil could give rise to environmental damage or lead to other adverse consequences. Each of these inherent risks may also result in death or injury to persons, loss of revenues or

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The shipping
	industry has historically been affected by acts of piracy in regions such as the South China Sea, the Indian Ocean, the Gulf of Aden off the coast of Somalia and the Red Sea. Although the frequency of sea piracy worldwide has decreased in recent
	years, sea piracy incidents continue to occur, particularly in the Gulf of Aden and towards the Mozambique Channel in the North Indian Ocean and increasingly in the Gulf of Guinea. A significant example of the heightened level of piracy came in
	February 2011 when the M/V Irene SL, a crude oil tanker in the Arabian Sea which was not affiliated with us, was captured by pirates in the Arabian Sea while carrying crude oil estimated to be worth approximately $200 million. In December 2009, the
	Navios Apollon, a vessel owned by Navios Maritime Partners L.P. (&#147;Navios Partners&#148;), was seized by pirates 800 miles off the coast of Somalia while transporting fertilizer from Tampa, Florida to Rozi, India and was released on
	February&nbsp;27, 2010. In January 2014, the Nave Atropos, a vessel owned by us, came under attack from a pirate action group in international waters off the coast of Yemen and in February 2016, the Nave Jupiter, a vessel also owned by us, came
	under attack from pirate action groups on her way our from her loading terminal about 50nautical miles off Bayelsa, Nigeria. In both instances, the crew and the on-board security team successfully implemented the counter piracy action plan and
	standard operating procedures to deter the attack with no consequences to the vessels or their crew. These piracy attacks have resulted in regions (in which our vessels are deployed) being characterized by insurers as &#147;war risk&#148; zones or
	Joint War Committee (JWC) &#147;war and strikes&#148; listed areas. Premiums payable for insurance coverage could increase significantly and insurance coverage may be more difficult to obtain. Crew costs, including those due to employing onboard
	security guards, could increase in such circumstances. While the use of security guards is intended to deter and prevent the hijacking of our vessels, it could also increase our risk of liability for death or injury to persons or damage to personal
	property. In addition, while we believe the charterer remains liable for charter payments when a vessel is seized by pirates, the charterer may dispute this and withhold charter hire until the vessel is released. A charterer may also claim that a
	vessel seized by pirates was not &#147;on-hire&#148; for a certain number of days and it is therefore entitled to cancel the charter party, a claim that we would dispute. We may not be adequately insured to cover losses from these incidents, which
	could have a material adverse effect on us. In addition, detention hijacking as a result of an act of piracy against our vessels, or an increase in cost, or unavailability of insurance for our vessels, could have a material adverse impact on our
	business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Acts of piracy on ocean-going vessels could adversely affect our business and operations.

	accumulation of public debt, continued deleveraging in the banking sector and a limited supply of credit. Recent conflicts in Iraq, Afghanistan, Syria, Ukraine, other current conflicts, and
	continuing concerns relating to the European sovereign debt crisis have led to increased volatility in global credit and equity markets. Several European countries including Greece, have been affected by increasing public debt burdens and weakening
	economic growth prospects. In recent years, Standard and Poor&#146;s Rating Services and Moody&#146;s Investors Service downgraded the long-term ratings of most European countries&#146; sovereign debt and initiated negative outlooks. Such downgrades

	Recently, a number of financial institutions have experienced serious financial difficulties and, in some cases, have entered bankruptcy
	proceedings or are in regulatory enforcement actions. These difficulties resulted, in part, from declining markets for assets held by such institutions, particularly the reduction in the value of their mortgage and asset-backed securities
	portfolios. These difficulties were compounded by financial turmoil affecting the world&#146;s debt, credit and capital markets, and the general decline in the willingness by banks and other financial institutions to extend credit, particularly to
	the shipping industry due to the historically low vessel earnings and values, and, in part, due to changes in overall banking regulations (for example, Basel III). As a result, the ability of banks and credit institutions to finance new projects,
	including the acquisition of new vessels in the future, were for a time uncertain. Following the stress tests run by the European Central Bank, revised capital ratios have been communicated to European banks. This has reduced the uncertainty
	following the difficulties of the past several years, but it has also led to changes in each bank&#146;s lending policies and ability to provide financing or refinancing. A recurrence of global economic weakness may adversely affect the financial
	institutions that provide our credit facilities and may impair their ability to continue to perform under their financing obligations to us, which could have an impact on our ability to fund current and future obligations.

	Furthermore, we may experience difficulties obtaining financing commitments, including commitments to refinance our existing debt as payments
	come due under our credit facilities, in the future if lenders are unwilling to extend financing to us or unable to meet their funding obligations due to their own liquidity, capital or solvency issues. Due to the fact that we would possibly cover
	all or a portion of the cost of any new acquisition with debt financing, such uncertainty, combined with restrictions imposed by our current debt, could hamper our ability to finance vessels or other assets and new business acquisitions.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	In addition, the economic uncertainty worldwide has made demand for shipping services volatile and has reduced charter rates, which may
	adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. Currently, the economies of China, Japan, other Asian Pacific countries and India are the main driving force behind the development in seaborne transportation. Reduced demand from

	Holdings or the Manager may make decisions that a more experienced operator in the sector might not make. If Navios Holdings or the Manager is not able to properly assess or ascertain a particular aspect of the crude oil, product or chemical tanker

	developing and maintaining long-term relationships with our customers. We believe that the Navios brand will allow us to take advantage of increasing global environmental concerns that have created a demand in the petroleum products/crude oil

	We own a large fleet of modern, high&#150;quality double&#150;hull tankers that are designed for enhanced safety and low operating costs. We believe that the increased enforcement
	of stringent environmental standards currently being imposed throughout the world has resulted in a shift in major charterers&#146; preference towards greater use of modern double&#150;hull vessels. We also have a large proportion of young product
	and chemical tankers in our fleet. Since our inception, we have committed to and have fully financed investments of over $2.1 billion, including investments of approximately $0.8 billion in newbuilding constructions. As of March&nbsp;17, 2016, our
	fleet had an average age of approximately 5.0 years. We believe that owning and maintaining a modern, high&#150;quality fleet reduces off&#150;hire time and operating costs, improves safety and environmental performance and provides us with a
	competitive advantage in securing employment for our vessels.

	years, and we believe our existing charter coverage provides us with predictable, contracted revenues and operating visibility. As of March&nbsp;17, 2016, we had charters covering 84.7% of available days in 2016 and 44.3% of available days in 2017.
	The charter arrangements for our eight VLCC tankers, eight contracted LR1 tankers, 18 MR2 product tankers and four chemical tankers represent $ 194.6&nbsp;million in 2016, and $97.8 million in 2017 of aggregate contracted net charter revenue,

	Our diversified fleet, which includes VLCC, product and chemical tankers, allows us to serve our customers&#146; international crude oil, petroleum product and liquid bulk chemical
	transportation needs. VLCC tankers transport crude oil and operate on primarily long&#150;haul trades from the Arabian Gulf to the Far East, North America and Europe. Product tankers transport a large number of different refined oil products, such
	as naphtha, gasoline, kerosene, jetfuel and gasoil, and principally operate on short&#150; to medium&#150;haul routes. Chemical tankers transport primarily organic and inorganic chemicals, vegetable oils and animal fats. We believe that our fleet of
	vessels servicing the crude oil, product and chemical tanker transportation sectors provides us with more balanced exposure to oil and commodities and more diverse opportunities to generate revenues than would a focus on any single shipping sector.

	Implement and Sustain a Competitive Cost Structure.

	Pursuant to our management agreement with the Manager, a wholly owned subsidiary of Navios Holdings, the Manager coordinates and oversees the commercial,
	technical and administrative management of our fleet. The current technical managers of some of the VLCC vessels, affiliates of the seller of the vessels acquired as part of the VLCC Acquisition are technical ship management companies that have
	provided technical management to the VLCC vessels acquired during the VLCC Acquisition prior to the consummation of the acquisition thereof. These technical managers will continue to provide such services for an interim period, after which the
	technical management of our fleet is expected to be provided solely by the Manager. We believe that the Manager will be able to do so at rates competitive with those that would be available to us through independent vessel management companies. For
	example, pursuant to our management agreement with Navios Holdings, management fees of our vessels are fixed through May 2016. We believe this external management arrangement will enhance the scalability of our business by allowing us to grow our
	fleet without incurring significant additional overhead costs. We believe that we will be able to leverage the economies of scale of Navios Holdings and manage operating, maintenance and corporate costs. At the same time, we believe the young age
	and high-quality of the vessels in our fleet, coupled with Navios Holdings&#146; safety and environmental record, will position us favorably within the crude oil, product and chemical tanker transportation sectors with our customers and for future

	The market for international seaborne crude oil transportation services is fragmented and highly competitive. Seaborne crude oil transportation
	services generally are provided by two main types of operators: major oil company captive fleets (both private and state-owned) and independent ship owner fleets. In addition, several owners and operators pool their vessels together on an ongoing
	basis, and such pools are available to customers to the same extent as independently owned and operated fleets. Many major oil companies and other oil trading companies also operate their own vessels and use such vessels not only to transport their
	own crude oil but also to transport crude oil for third party charterers in direct competition with independent owners and operators in the tanker charter market. Competition for charters is intense and is based upon price, location, size, age,
	condition and acceptability of the vessel and its manager. Due in part to the fragmented tanker market, competitors with greater resources could enter the tanker market and operate larger fleets through acquisitions or consolidations and may be
	willing or able to accept lower prices than us, which could result in our achieving lower revenues from our vessels.

	Traditionally there have been relatively few charterers in the oil transportation business and that
	part of the industry has been undergoing consolidation. The so called &#147;oil majors,&#148; such as Exxon Mobil, BP p.l.c., Royal Dutch Shell plc., Chevron, ConocoPhillips and Total S.A., together with a few smaller companies, represent a
	significant percentage of the production, trading and, especially, seaborne transportation of crude oil and refined petroleum products worldwide. Concerns about the environment have led oil majors to develop and implement a strict due diligence
	process, known as vetting, when selecting vessels and considering their managers. Vetting has evolved into a sophisticated and comprehensive assessment of both the vessel and the vessel manager. While numerous factors are considered and evaluated
	prior to a commercial decision, the oil majors, through their association, Oil Companies International Marine Forum (OCIMF), have developed two basic tools: the Ship Inspection Report program, which is known as SIRE, and the Tanker
	Management&nbsp;&amp; Self Assessment program, which is known as TMSA. Based upon commercial risk, there are three levels of assessment used by oil majors:

	The depth and

	the terms of the charter agreements, the charterers require that our vessels and their technical managers be vetted and approved to transport crude oil or refined petroleum products (as applicable). The technical manager is responsible for obtaining
	and maintaining the vetting approvals required to successfully charter our vessels.

	Not all risks are insured and not all risks are insurable. The principal insurable risks which nonetheless remain uninsured across our fleet
	are &#147;loss of hire&#148; and &#147;strikes,&#148; except in cases of loss of hire due to war or a piracy event. Specifically, Navios Acquisition does not insure these risks because the costs are regarded as disproportionate. These insurances
	provide, subject to a deductible, a limited indemnity for hire that would not be receivable by the shipowner for reasons set forth in the policy. Should a vessel on time charter, where the vessel is paid a fixed hire day by day, suffer a serious
	mechanical breakdown, the daily hire will no longer be payable by the charterer. Under some circumstances, an event of force majeure may also permit the charterer to terminate the time charter or suspend payment of charter hire. The purpose of the
	loss of hire insurance is to secure the loss of hire during such periods. In the case of strikes insurance, if a vessel is being paid a fixed sum to perform a voyage and the ship becomes strike bound at a loading or discharging port, the insurance
	covers the loss of earnings during such periods.

	Shipping is one of the world&#146;s most heavily regulated industries, and, in addition, it is subject to many industry standards. Government
	regulation significantly affects the ownership and operation of vessels. These regulations consist mainly of rules and standards established by international conventions, but they also include national, state, and local laws and regulations in force
	in jurisdictions where vessels may operate or are registered, and which are commonly more stringent than international rules and standards. This is the case particularly in the United States and, increasingly, in Europe.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	A variety of governmental and private entities subject vessels to both scheduled and unscheduled inspections. These entities include local
	port authorities (the U.S. Coast Guard, harbor masters or equivalent entities), classification societies, flag state administration (country vessel of registry), and charterers, particularly terminal operators. Certain of these entities require
	vessel owners to obtain permits, licenses, and certificates for the operation of their vessels. Failure to maintain necessary permits or approvals could require a vessel owner to incur substantial costs or temporarily suspend operation of one or

	Heightened levels of environmental and quality concerns among insurance underwriters, regulators, and charterers
	continue to lead to greater inspection and safety requirements on all vessels and may accelerate the scrapping of older vessels throughout the industry. Increasing environmental concerns have created a demand for vessels that conform to stricter

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The International Maritime Organization, or IMO, has adopted a number of international conventions concerned with ship safety and with
	preventing, reducing or controlling pollution from ships. These fall into two main categories, consisting firstly of those concerned generally with ship safety standards, and secondly of those specifically concerned with measures to prevent
	pollution.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	In the former category the primary international instrument is the Safety of Life at Sea Convention of 1974, as amended, or
	SOLAS, together with the regulations and codes of practice that form part of its regime. Much of SOLAS is not directly concerned with preventing pollution, but some of its safety provisions are intended to prevent pollution as well as promote safety
	of life and preservation of property. These regulations have been and continue to be regularly amended as new and higher safety standards are introduced with which we are required to comply.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	An amendment of SOLAS introduced the International Safety Management (ISM) Code, which has been effective since July 1998. Under the ISM Code
	the party with operational control of a vessel is required to develop an extensive safety management system that includes, among other things, the adoption of a safety and environmental protection policy setting forth instructions and procedures for
	operating its vessels safely and describing procedures for responding to emergencies. The ISM Code requires that vessel operators obtain a safety management certificate for each vessel they operate. This certificate evidences compliance by a
	vessel&#146;s management with code requirements for a safety management system. No vessel can obtain a certificate unless its manager has been awarded a document of compliance, issued by the flag state for the vessel, under the ISM Code.
	Noncompliance with the ISM Code and other IMO regulations, such as the mandatory ship energy efficiency management plan (&#147;SEEMP&#148;) which is akin to a safety management plan and came into effect on January&nbsp;1, 2013, may subject a ship
	owner to increased liability, may lead to decreases in available insurance coverage for affected vessels, and may result in the denial of access to, or detention in, some ports. For example, the United States Coast Guard and European Union
	authorities have indicated that vessels not in compliance with the ISM Code will be prohibited from trading in ports in the United States and European Union. Each vessel&#146;s

	In the second main category of international regulation, the primary instrument is the International
	Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships, or MARPOL, which imposes environmental standards on the shipping industry set out in Annexes I-VI of MARPOL. These contain regulations for the prevention of pollution by oil (Annex I), by
	noxious liquid substances in bulk (Annex II), by harmful substances in packaged forms within the scope of the International Maritime Dangerous Goods Code (Annex III), by sewage (Annex IV), by garbage (Annex V), and by air emissions (Annex VI).
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	These regulations have been and continue to be regularly amended as new and more stringent standards of pollution prevention are introduced
	with which we are required to comply. For example, MARPOL Annex VI, together with the NOx Technical Code established thereunder, sets limits on sulfur oxide and nitrogen oxide emissions from ship exhausts and prohibits deliberate emissions of ozone
	depleting substances, such as chlorofluorocarbons. It also includes a global cap on the sulfur content of fuel oil and allows for special areas to be established with more stringent controls on emissions. Originally adopted in September 1997, Annex
	VI came into force in May 2005 and was amended in October 2008 (as was the NOx Technical Code) to provide for progressively more stringent limits on such emissions from 2010 onwards. The revised Annex VI provides, in particular, for a reduction of
	the global sulfur cap, initially to 3.5% (from the previous cap of 4.5%), with effect from January&nbsp;1, 2012, then progressively reducing to 0.50% effective from January&nbsp;1, 2020, subject to a feasibility review to be completed no later than
	2018 (regarding the availability of compliant fuel which could defer the requirement to January&nbsp;1, 2025); and the establishment of new tiers of stringent nitrogen oxide emissions standards for marine engines, depending on their date of
	installation. We anticipate incurring costs in complying with these more stringent standards. At MEPC 68 (2015), draft amendments to Annex VI were approved for additional record requirements for operational compliance with NOx Tier III emission
	control areas, and are set for adoption in MEPC 69 (2016).

	In addition to MARPOL, other more specialized international instruments have been adopted to prevent different types of pollution or
	environmental harm from ships. In February 2004, the IMO adopted an International Convention for the Control and Management of Ships&#146; Ballast Water and Sediments, or the BWM Convention. The BWM Convention&#146;s implementing regulations call

	The BWM Convention will not enter into force until 12 months after it has been adopted by 30 states, the combined merchant fleets of which

	incident in 1999, the
	European Community has become increasingly active in the field of regulation of maritime safety and protection of the environment. It has been the driving force behind a number of amendments of MARPOL (including, for example, changes to accelerate
	the time-table for the phase-out of single hull tankers, and to prohibit the carriage in such tankers of heavy grades of oil), and if dissatisfied either with the extent of such amendments or with the time-table for their introduction it has been
	prepared to legislate on a unilateral basis. It should be noted, for instance, that the EU has its own regime as far as ship emissions are concerned and whilst it does in some respects reflect the IMO regime, this is not always the case. As far as
	sulfur dioxide emissions are concerned, for example, the EU regulation has not just caught up with the IMO limits for sulfur in ECAs, but it continues to have certain elements that exceed IMO regulations (e.g., as of January&nbsp;1, 2015, EU Member
	States must ensure that ships in the Baltic, the North Seam and the English Channel are using gas oils with a sulfur content of no more than 0.10%).

	In some areas of regulation the EU has introduced new laws without attempting to procure a corresponding amendment of international law.
	Notably, it adopted in 2005 a directive on ship-source pollution, imposing criminal sanctions for pollution not only where this is caused by intent or recklessness (which would be an offense under MARPOL), but also where it is caused by
	&#147;serious negligence.&#148; The directive could therefore result in criminal liability being incurred in circumstances where it would not be incurred under international law. Experience has shown that in the emotive atmosphere often associated
	with pollution incidents, retributive attitudes towards ship interests have found expression in negligence being alleged by prosecutors and found by courts. Moreover, there is skepticism that the notion of &#147;serious negligence&#148; is likely to

	U.S. federal legislation, including notably the Oil Pollution Act of 1990, or OPA, establishes an extensive regulatory and liability regime
	for the protection and cleanup of the environment from oil spills, including cargo or bunker oil spills from tankers. OPA affects all owners and operators whose vessels trade in the United States, its territories and possessions or whose vessels
	operate in United States waters, which includes the United States&#146; territorial sea and its 200 nautical mile exclusive economic zone. Under OPA, vessel owners, operators and bareboat charterers are &#147;responsible parties&#148; and are

	OPA liability limits are periodically adjusted for inflation, and the

	greater of $3,500 per gross ton or $25.846 million (this amount is reduced to $7.05 million if the vessel is less than 3,000 gross tons). For tank vessels over 3,000 gross tons, other than a single-hull vessel, liability is limited to $2,200 per
	gross ton or $18.8 million (or $4.7 million for a vessel less than 3,000 gross tons), whichever is greater. Under the OPA, these liability limits do not apply if an incident was directly caused by violation of applicable United States federal

	vessels. Several international conventions impose and limit pollution liability from vessels. An owner of a tanker vessel carrying a cargo of &#147;persistent oil&#148; as defined by the International Convention for Civil Liability for Oil Pollution
	Damage (the &#147;CLC&#148;) is subject under the convention to strict liability for any pollution damage caused in a contracting state by an escape or discharge from cargo or bunker tanks. This liability is subject to a financial limit calculated
	by reference to the tonnage of the ship, and the right to limit liability may be lost if the spill is caused by the shipowner&#146;s intentional or reckless conduct. Liability may also be incurred under the CLC for a bunker spill from the vessel
	even when she is not carrying such cargo, but is in ballast.

	When a tanker is carrying clean oil products that do not constitute &#147;persistent oil&#148;
	that would be covered under the CLC, liability for any pollution damage will generally fall outside the CLC and will depend on other international conventions or domestic laws in the jurisdiction where the spillage occurs. The same principle applies
	to any pollution from the vessel in a jurisdiction which is not a party to the CLC. The CLC applies in over 100 jurisdictions around the world, but it does not apply in the United States, where the corresponding liability laws such as the OPA
	discussed above, are particularly stringent.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	In 2001, the IMO adopted the International Convention on Civil Liability for Bunker Oil
	Pollution Damage, or the Bunker Convention, which imposes strict liability on shipowners for pollution damage in jurisdictional waters of ratifying states caused by discharges of &#147;bunker oil.&#148; The Bunker Convention defines &#147;bunker
	oil&#148; as &#147;any hydrocarbon mineral oil, including lubricating oil, used or intended to be used for the operation or propulsion of the ship, and any residues of such oil.&#148; The Bunker Convention also requires registered owners of ships
	over a certain size to maintain insurance for pollution damage in an amount equal to the limits of liability under the applicable national or international limitation regime (but not exceeding the amount calculated in accordance with the Convention
	on Limitation of Liability for Maritime Claims of 1976, as amended, or the 1976 Convention). The Bunker Convention entered into force on November&nbsp;21, 2008, and as of March&nbsp;8, 2016, had 82 contracting states. In other jurisdictions
	liability for spills or releases of oil from ships&#146; bunkers continues to be determined by the national or other domestic laws in the jurisdiction where the events or damages occur.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Outside the United States, national laws generally provide for the owner to bear strict liability for pollution, subject to a right to limit
	liability under applicable national or international regimes for limitation of liability. The most widely applicable international regime limiting maritime pollution liability is the 1976 Convention. Rights to limit liability under the 1976
	Convention are forfeited where a spill is caused by a shipowners&#146; intentional or reckless conduct. Some states have ratified the 1996 LLMC Protocol to the 1976 Convention, which provides for liability limits substantially higher than those set
	forth in the 1976 Convention to apply in such states. Finally, some jurisdictions are not a party to either the 1976 Convention or the 1996 LLMC Protocol, and, therefore, shipowners&#146; rights to limit liability for maritime pollution in such
	jurisdictions may be uncertain.

	Navios Acquisition&#146;s fleet is currently entered for protection and indemnity insurance with
	International Group associations where, in line with all International Group Clubs, coverage for oil pollution is limited to $1.0 billion per event. The 13 P&amp;I Associations that comprise the International Group insure approximately 95% of the
	world&#146;s commercial tonnage and have entered into a pooling agreement to collectively reinsure each association&#146;s liabilities. Each vessel that Navios Acquisition acquires will be entered with P&amp;I Associations of the International
	Group. Under the International Group reinsurance program for the current policy year, each P&amp;I club in the International Group is responsible for the first $9.0 million of every claim. In every claim the amount in excess of $9.0 million and up
	to $80.0 million is shared by the clubs under the pooling agreement. Any claim in excess of $80.0 million is reinsured by the International Group in the international reinsurance market under the General Excess of Loss Reinsurance Contract. This
	policy currently provides an additional $2.0 billion of coverage for non-oil pollution claims. Further to this, an additional reinsurance layer has been placed by the International Group for claims up to $1.0 billion in excess of $2.08 billion,
	i.e., $3.08 billion in total. For passengers and crew claims the overall limit is $3.0 billion for any one event with any one vessel with a sub-limit of $2.0 billion for passengers. With the exception of pollution, passenger or crew claims, should
	any other P&amp;I claim exceed Group reinsurance limits, the provisions of all International Group Club&#146;s overspill claim rules will operate and members of any International Group Club will be liable for additional contributions in accordance
	with such rules. To date, there has never been an overspill claim, or one even nearing this level.

	members of the individual associations, and members of the pool of P&amp;I Associations comprising the International Group. The P&amp;I Associations&#146; policy year commences on February&nbsp;20th. Calls are levied by means of Estimated Total
	Premiums (&#147;ETP&#148;) and the amount of the final installment of the ETP varies according to the actual total premium ultimately required by the club for a particular policy year. Members have a liability to pay supplementary calls which might

	On May&nbsp;6, 2014, Navios Acquisition sold
	the Shinyo Splendor to an unaffiliated third party for an aggregate sale price of $20.0 million. As of March&nbsp;31, 2014, an impairment loss of $10.7 million related to the Shinyo Splendor has been recognized under the line item &#147;Impairment
	Loss.&#148; The Company had a current expectation that, more likely than not, the Shinyo Splendor would be sold before the end of its previously estimated useful life, and as a result performed an impairment test of the specific asset group. The
	carrying amount of the asset group was more than its undiscounted future cash flows which resulted in an impairment loss (refer to Note 2(l) for further details related to the impairment test). The vessel&#146;s aggregate net carrying amount as at
	the date of sale was $19.2 million (including the remaining carrying balance of dry dock and special survey costs in the amount of $1.0 million). The Company received net cash proceeds in the amount of $18.3 million and recognized a loss of $0.9
	million. This loss is presented under &#147;Gain / (loss) on sale of vessels&#148; in the consolidated statements of operations.

	Our primary short-term liquidity needs are to
	fund general working capital requirements, drydocking expenditures, minimum cash balance maintenance as per our credit facility agreements and debt repayment, while our long-term liquidity needs primarily relate to expansion and investment capital

	generated by our fleet, while maintenance capital expenditures primarily consist of drydocking expenditures and expenditures to replace vessels in order to maintain the operating capacity of or revenue generated by our fleet. We anticipate that our
	primary sources of funds for our short-term liquidity needs will be cash flows from operations, proceeds from asset sales and bank borrowings which we believe that will be sufficient to meet our existing short-term liquidity needs for at least the

	Although the aforementioned excess of carrying value over fair value represents an estimate of the loss that
	Navios Acquisition would sustain on a hypothetical disposition of those vessels as of December&nbsp;31, 2015, the recognition of the unrealized loss absent a disposition (i.e., as an impairment) would require, among other things, that a triggering
	event had occurred and that the undiscounted cash flows attributable to the vessel are also less than the carrying value of the vessel (including the unamortized portion of deferred drydock and special survey costs related to the vessel).

	Use of Estimates:
</I>
</B>
	The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make
	estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the
	reporting periods. On an on-going basis, management evaluates the estimates and judgments, including those related to uncompleted voyages, future drydock dates, the selection of useful lives for tangible assets and scrap value expected future cash
	flows from long-lived assets to support impairment tests, provisions necessary for accounts receivable, provisions for legal disputes, and contingencies and the valuation estimates inherent in the deconsolidation gain. Management bases its estimates
	and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not
	readily apparent from other sources. Actual results could differ from those estimates under different assumptions and/or conditions.

	Vessels, Net:
</I>
</B>
	Vessels are stated at historical cost, which consists of the contract price, delivery and acquisition expenses and
	capitalized interest costs while under construction. Vessels acquired in an asset acquisition or in a business combination are recorded at fair value. Subsequent expenditures for major improvements and upgrading are capitalized, provided they
	appreciably extend the life, increase the earning capacity or improve the efficiency or safety of the vessels. Expenditures for routine maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred.

	Depreciation is computed using the straight line method over the useful life of the vessels, after considering the estimated residual value.
	Management estimates the residual values of our tanker vessels based on a scrap value cost of steel times the weight of the ship noted in lightweight ton (LWT). Residual values are periodically reviewed and revised to recognize changes in
	conditions, new regulations or other reasons. Revisions of residual values affect the depreciable amount of the vessels and affects depreciation expense in the period of the revision and future periods. The management after considering current
	market trends for scrap rates and 10-year average historical scrap rates of the residual values of the Company&#146;s vessels, estimates scrap value at a rate of $360 per LWT. Management estimates the useful life of our vessels to be 25 years from
	the vessel&#146;s original construction. However, when regulations place limitations over the ability of a vessel to trade on a worldwide basis, its useful life is re-estimated to end at the date such regulations become effective.

	Impairment of long-lived Asset Group:
</I>
</B>
	Vessels, other fixed assets and other
	long-lived assets held and used by Navios Acquisition are reviewed periodically for potential impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a particular asset may not be fully recoverable. Navios
	Acquisition&#146;s management evaluates the carrying amounts and periods over which long-lived assets are depreciated to determine if events or changes in circumstances have occurred that would require modification to their carrying values or useful
	lives. In evaluating useful lives and carrying values of long-lived assets, certain indicators of potential impairment are reviewed such as, undiscounted projected operating cash flows, vessel sales and purchases, business plans and overall market
	conditions.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Undiscounted projected net operating cash flows are determined for each asset group (consisting of the individual vessel and
	the intangible, if any, with respect to the time charter agreement attached to that vessel) and compared to the vessel carrying value and related carrying value of the intangible with respect to the time charter agreement attached to that vessel or
	the carrying value of deposits for newbuildings (if any). Within the shipping industry, vessels are often bought and sold with a charter attached. The value of the charter may be favorable or unfavorable when comparing the charter rate to then
	current market rates. The loss recognized either on impairment (or on disposition) will reflect the excess of carrying value over fair value (selling price) for the vessel individual asset group.

	As of March&nbsp;31, 2014, the Company had a current expectation that, more likely than not, the Shinyo Splendor would be sold before the end
	of its previously estimated useful life, and, as a result, performed an impairment test of the specific asset group. The recoverability test was based on undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the entity&#146;s use and eventual disposition
	of the asset. The significant factors and assumptions used in the undiscounted projected net operating cash flow analysis included determining the net operating cash flows by considering the charter revenues from the existing time charter until its
	expiration, net of brokerage and address commissions and management fees and an estimate of sale proceeds from its disposal based on market valuations for such vessel. The carrying amount of the asset group was more than its undiscounted future cash
	flows. As a result, the entity failed the recoverability test (step one) of the impairment test and proceeded with step two of the impairment analysis. An impairment loss in the amount of $10.7 million was recognized on this asset group as the
	carrying amount of the asset group was not recoverable and exceeded its fair value as of March&nbsp;31, 2014. The Shinyo Splendor was sold on May&nbsp;6, 2014 to an unaffiliated third party for a net cash consideration of $18.3 million (refer to
	Note 5 &#147;Vessels, Net&#148;).

	During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015, management concluded that, although market rates were at
	healthy levels during the year, however, events occurred and circumstances had changed, over previous years, which indicated the potential impairment of Navios Acquisition&#146;s long-lived assets may exist. These indicators included continued
	volatility in the charter market and the related impact of the tanker sector has on management&#146;s expectation for future revenues. As a result, an impairment assessment of long-lived assets or identified asset groups was performed.

	The Company determined undiscounted projected net operating cash flows for each vessel and compared it to the vessel&#146;s carrying value

	charter revenues from existing time charters for the fixed fleet days (Company&#146;s remaining charter agreement rates) and an estimated daily time charter equivalent for the unfixed days (based on the 10- year average historical one year time
	charter rates) over the remaining economic life of each vessel, net of brokerage and address commissions, excluding days of scheduled off-hires, management fees fixed until May 2016 and thereafter assuming an annual increase of 3.0% and utilization

	Revenue Recognition:
</I>
</B>
	Revenue is recorded when services are rendered, under a signed charter agreement or other evidence of
	an arrangement, the price is fixed or determinable, and collection is reasonably assured. Revenue is generated from the voyage charter and the time charter of vessels.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Voyage revenues for the transportation of cargo are recognized ratably over the estimated relative transit time of each voyage. Voyage
	expenses are recognized as incurred. A voyage is deemed to commence when a vessel is available for loading and is deemed to end upon the completion of the discharge of the current cargo. Estimated losses on voyages are provided for in full at the
	time such losses become evident. Under a voyage charter, a vessel is provided for the transportation of specific goods between specific ports in return for payment of an agreed upon freight per ton of cargo.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Revenues from time chartering of vessels are accounted for as operating leases and are thus recognized on a straight-line basis as the average
	revenue over the rental periods of such charter agreements, as service is performed. A time charter involves placing a vessel at the charterers&#146; disposal for a period of time during which the charterer uses the vessel in return for the payment
	of a specified daily hire rate. Under time charters, operating costs such as for crews, maintenance and insurance are typically paid by the owner of the vessel.

	Profit-sharing revenues are calculated at an agreed percentage of the excess of the charterer&#146;s average daily income (calculated on a
	quarterly or half-yearly basis) over an agreed amount and accounted for on an accrual basis based on provisional amounts and for those contracts that provisional accruals cannot be made due to the nature of the profit share elements, these are
	accounted for on the actual cash settlement. Profit sharing for the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2015,&nbsp;December&nbsp;31, 2014 and December&nbsp;31, 2013 amounted to $32.1 million, $6.7 million and $4.4 million, respectively.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Revenues are recorded net of address commissions. Address commissions represent a discount provided directly to the charterers based on a
	fixed percentage of the agreed upon charter or freight rate. Since address commissions represent a discount (sales incentive) on services rendered by the Company and no identifiable benefit is received in exchange for the consideration provided to
	the charterer, these commissions are presented as a reduction of revenue.

	For vessels operating in pooling arrangements, the Company

	is determined by points awarded to each vessel in the pool based on the vessel&#146;s age, design and other performance characteristics. Revenue under pooling arrangements is accounted for on the accrual basis and is recognized when an agreement
	with the pool exists, price is fixed, service is provided and the collectability is reasonably assured. Revenue for vessels operating in pooling arrangements amounted to $43.4 million, $17.0 million and $0, for the years ended December&nbsp;31,
	2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.

	of Uncertainties About an Entity&#146;s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern&#148;. This standard requires management to assess an entity&#146;s ability to continue as a going concern, and to provide related footnote disclosures in certain

	our common stock on a dollar-for-dollar basis and thereafter as capital gain, which will be either long-term or short-term capital gain depending upon whether the U.S. Holder held the common shares for more than one year. Because Navios Acquisition

	Dividends received by a non-corporate U.S. Holder are taxed at ordinary income tax rates (currently, a maximum 39.6%) unless such dividends
	constitute &#147;qualified dividend income.&#148; &#147;Qualified dividend income&#148; generally includes a dividend paid by a foreign corporation if (i)&nbsp;the stock with respect to which such dividend was paid is readily tradable on an
	established securities market in the U.S., (ii)&nbsp;the foreign corporation is not a PFIC for the taxable year during which the dividend is paid and the immediately preceding taxable year (which we do not believe we have been for 2015, or will be

	certain risk limiting transactions with respect to such stock), and (iv)&nbsp;the non-corporate U.S. Holder is not under an obligation to make related payments with respect to positions in substantially similar or related property. Qualified
	dividend income is subject to the long-term capital gain tax rate, which is currently a maximum of 20%. In addition, a 3.8% tax may apply to certain investment income.

	Special rules may apply to any amounts received in respect of our common stock that are treated as &#147;extraordinary dividends.&#148; In

	addition, extraordinary dividends include dividends received within a one year period that, in the aggregate, equal or exceed 20.0% of a U.S. Holder&#146;s adjusted tax basis (or fair market value). If we pay an &#147;extraordinary dividend&#148; on
	our common stock that is treated as &#147;qualified dividend income,&#148; then any loss recognized by an individual U.S. Holder from the sale or exchange of such common stock will be treated as long-term capital loss to the extent of the amount of

	Subject to the discussion of PFICs below, a U.S. Holder generally will recognize capital gain or loss upon a sale, exchange or other
	disposition of a share of our common stock in an amount equal to the difference between the amount realized by the U.S. Holder from such sale, exchange or other disposition and the U.S. Holder&#146;s adjusted tax basis in such stock. The U.S.
	Holder&#146;s initial tax basis in a share of our common stock generally will be the U.S. Holder&#146;s purchase price for the share and that tax basis will be reduced (but not below zero) by the amount of any distributions on our common stock that
	are treated as non-taxable returns of capital (as discussed under &#147;&#151; Distributions&#148; above). Such gain or loss will be treated as long-term capital gain or loss if the U.S. Holder&#146;s holding period is greater than one year at the
	time of the sale, exchange or other disposition. Such capital gain or loss will generally be treated as U.S.-source income or loss, as applicable, for U.S. foreign tax credit purposes.

	subsidiary&#146;s stock) in connection with the production of such income, in particular, the vessels we own (or we are deemed to own) that are subject to time charters, should not constitute passive assets for purposes of determining whether we are

	activities is services income or rental income. Moreover, in a case not interpreting the PFIC rules, Tidewater Inc. v. United States, 565 F.3d 299 (5th Cir. 2009), the Fifth Circuit held that the vessel time charters at issue generated predominantly
	rental income rather than services income. However, the IRS stated in an Action on Decision (AOD 2010-001) that it disagrees with, and will not acquiesce to, the way that the rental versus services framework was applied to the facts in the Tidewater

	Our functional and reporting currency is the U.S. dollar. We engage in worldwide commerce with a variety of entities. Although
	our operations may expose us to certain levels of foreign currency risk, our transactions are predominantly U.S. dollar denominated. Transactions in currencies other than U.S. dollar are translated at the exchange rate in effect at the date of each
	transaction. Differences in exchange rates during the period between the date a transaction denominated in a foreign currency is consummated and the date on which it is either settled or translated, are recognized. Expenses incurred in foreign
	currencies against which the U.S.&nbsp;Dollar falls in value can increase thereby decreasing our income or vice versa if the U.S. dollar increases in value. For example, during the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2015, the value of U.S. dollar
	increased by approximately 11.5% as compared to the Euro.

	long-term indebtedness. The debt is U.S. dollar-denominated. Borrowings under our credit facilities bear interest at rates based on a premium over U.S. $ LIBOR except for the interest rate on the Notes which is fixed. Therefore, we are exposed to
	the risk that our interest expense may increase if interest rates rise. For the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 we paid interest on our outstanding debt at a weighted average interest rate of 6.0%, 5.73% and 5.73%, respectively. A
	1% increase in LIBOR would have increased our interest expense for the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 by $4.9 million, $5.8 million and $5.4 million, respectively.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and the related consolidated statements of operations,
	changes in equity, and cash flows present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Navios Maritime Acquisition Corporation and its subsidiaries (the &#147;Company&#148;) at December 31, 2015 and 2014, and the results of their
	operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December&nbsp;31, 2015 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all
	material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2015, based on criteria established in Internal Control &#151;&nbsp;Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
	Treadway Commission (COSO). The Company&#146;s management is responsible for these financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over
	financial reporting, included in &#147;Management&#146;s annual report on internal control over financial reporting&#148; appearing in Item 15(b) of the Company&#146;s 2015 Annual Report on Form 20-F. Our responsibility is to express opinions on
	these financial statements and on the Company&#146;s internal control over financial reporting based on our integrated audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
	Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all
	material respects. Our audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
	management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material
	weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe
	that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	A company&#146;s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide
	reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company&#146;s internal control over financial
	reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable
	assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with
	authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company&#146;s assets that could have a material
	effect on the financial statements.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect
	misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may
	deteriorate.

	these costs will continue to be amortized as interest expense using the effective interest method pursuant to ASC 835-30-35-2 through 35-3. Upon adoption, the Company applied the new guidance retrospectively to all prior periods presented in the

	The Company has historically accounted for its investment in the common units of Navios Maritime Midstream Partners L.P. as available for sale securities, with
	the change in the market value of those securities recorded in other comprehensive income. The Company has reevaluated its accounting for those interests and concluded that they should be accounted for under the equity method of accounting.
	Management evaluated the materiality of the error, quantitatively and qualitatively, and determined it was not material to any of our previously issued financial statements. Accordingly, the Company has revised its previously reported results and
	related disclosures as of and for the year ended December 31, 2014 to correct its accounting. The schedule below provides a summary of the impact of the adjustment on the Company&#146;s consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended

	Affiliates are entities over which the Company generally has between 20% and 50% of the voting rights, or over which the Company has
	significant influence, but it does not exercise control. Investments in these entities are accounted for under the equity method of accounting. Under this method, the Company records an investment in the stock of an affiliate at cost, and adjusts
	the carrying amount for its share of the earnings or losses of the affiliate subsequent to the date of investment and reports the recognized earnings or losses in income. Dividends received from an affiliate reduce the carrying amount of the
	investment. The Company recognizes gains and losses in earnings for the issuance of shares by its affiliates, provided that the issuance of such shares qualifies as a sale of such shares. When the Company&#146;s share of losses in an affiliate
	equals or exceeds its interest in the affiliate, the Company does not recognize further losses, unless the Company has incurred obligations or made payments on behalf of the affiliate.

	Navios Acquisition evaluates its equity method investments, for other than temporary impairment, on a quarterly basis. Consideration is given
	to (1) the length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been less than the carrying value, (2) the financial condition and near-term prospects and (3) the intent and ability of the Company to retain its investments for a period of time
	sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in fair value.

	Subsidiaries are those entities in which
	the Company has an interest of more than one half of the voting rights and/or otherwise has power to govern the financial and operating policies. The acquisition method of accounting is used to account for the acquisition of subsidiaries if deemed
	to be a business combination. The cost of an acquisition is measured as the fair value of the assets given up, shares issued or liabilities undertaken at the date of acquisition. The excess of the cost of acquisition over the fair value of the net
	assets acquired and liabilities assumed is recorded as goodwill.

	The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent
	assets and liabilities as of the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. On an on-going basis, management evaluates the estimates and judgments, including those related to
	uncompleted voyages, future drydock dates, the selection of useful lives for tangible assets and scrap value, expected future cash flows from long-lived assets to support impairment tests, provisions necessary for accounts receivables, provisions
	for legal disputes and contingencies and the valuations estimates inherent in the deconsolidation gain. Management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the
	circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results could differ from those estimates under different
	assumptions and/or conditions.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Voyage revenues for the transportation of cargo are recognized ratably over the estimated relative transit time of each voyage. Voyage
	expenses are recognized as incurred. A voyage is deemed to commence when a vessel is available for loading and is deemed to end upon the completion of the discharge of the current cargo. Estimated losses on voyages are provided for in full at the
	time such losses become evident. Under a voyage charter, a vessel is provided for the transportation of specific goods between specific ports in return for payment of an agreed upon freight per ton of cargo.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Revenues from time chartering of vessels are accounted for as operating leases and are thus recognized on a straight-line basis as the average
	revenue over the rental periods of such charter agreements, as service is performed. A time charter involves placing a vessel at the charterers&#146; disposal for a period of time during which the charterer uses the vessel in return for the payment
	of a specified daily hire rate. Under time charters, operating costs such as for crews, maintenance and insurance are typically paid by the owner of the vessel.

	Profit-sharing revenues are calculated at an agreed percentage of the excess of the charterer&#146;s average daily income (calculated on a
	quarterly or half-yearly basis) over an agreed amount and accounted for on an accrual basis based on provisional amounts and for those contracts that provisional accruals cannot be made due to the nature of the profit share elements, these are
	accounted for on the actual cash settlement. Profit sharing for the years ended December 31, 2015, December 31, 2014 and December 31, 2013 amounted to $32,060, $6,710 and $4,360, respectively.

	On May 6, 2014,

	&#147;Impairment Loss.&#148; The Company had a current expectation that, more likely than not, the Shinyo Splendor would be sold before the end of its previously estimated useful life, and as a result performed an impairment test of the specific
	asset group. The carrying amount of the asset group was more than its undiscounted future cash flows which resulted in an impairment loss (refer to Note 2(l) for further details related to the impairment test). The vessel&#146;s aggregate net
	carrying amount as at the date of sale was $19,219

	Navios Acquisition reports

	by revenue per day and operating results of the fleet and thus Navios Acquisition has determined that it operates under one reportable segment.

	Following the default of their charterer in June 2013, the original charters of two MR2 product tankers, were terminated. Pursuant to the rehabilitation plan
	of the defaulted charterer, Navios Acquisition would be paid, partly in cash and partly in shares, for a loss claim that was agreed by the competent court in December 2013. The Company had a right to receive shares (issued in 2014) and therefore,
	recorded a derivative of $3,446 which was valued using the publicly available trading data on the settlement date. The derivative would be marked-to-market until the shares are received. The long-term notes receivable for cash of $1,177 was
	discounted using a discount rate that was determined based on the terms of the rehabilitation plan and managements&#146; estimates. The total amount of $4,623 was recognized in the consolidated statements of operations under &#147;Other Income&#148;

	relevant vessels&#146; tonnage. The payment of said duties exhausts the tax liability of the foreign ship owning company and the relevant manager against any tax, duty, charge or contribution payable on income from the exploitation of the foreign
	flagged vessel. The amount included in Navios Acquisition&#146;s statements of operations for each of the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, related to the Greek Tonnage tax was $551 and $336, respectively.

	Pursuant to Section 883 of the Internal Revenue Code of the United States (the &#147;Code&#148;), U.S. source income from the international operation of ships
	is generally exempt from U.S. income tax if the company operating the ships meets certain incorporation and ownership requirements. Among other things, in order to qualify for this exemption, the company operating the ships must be incorporated in a
	country, which grants an equivalent exemption from income taxes to U.S. corporations. All the Navios Acquisition&#146;s ship-operating subsidiaries satisfy these initial criteria. In addition, these companies must meet an ownership test. Subject to
	proposed regulations becoming finalized in their current form, the management of Navios Acquisition believes by virtue of a special rule applicable to situations where the ship operating companies are beneficially owned by a publicly traded company
	like Navios Acquisition, the second criterion can also be satisfied based on the trading volume and ownership of the Company&#146;s shares, but no assurance can be given that this will remain so in the future.

	In February
	2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-02, &#147;Leases (Topic 842)&#148; (&#147;ASU 2016-02&#148;). ASU 2016-02 will apply to both types of leases&nbsp;&#151;&nbsp;capital (or finance) leases and operating leases. According to
	the new Accounting Standard, lessees will be required to recognize assets and liabilities on the balance sheet for the rights and obligations created by all leases with terms of more than 12 months. ASU 2016-02 is effective for fiscal years
	beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early application is permitted. The Company is currently assessing the impact that adopting this new accounting guidance will have on its consolidated financial
	statements and footnotes disclosures.

	In February 2015, the FASB issued the ASU 2015-02, &#147;Consolidation (Topic 810)&nbsp;&#151;&nbsp;Amendments to
	the Consolidation Analysis&#148;, which amends the criteria for determining which entities are considered VIEs, amends the criteria for determining if a service provider possesses a variable interest in a VIE and ends the deferral granted to
	investment companies for application of the VIE consolidation model. The ASU is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2015. Early application is permitted. The Company does not expect the adoption of this ASU to have
	a material impact on Company&#146;s results of operations, financial position or cash flows.

	In January 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-01, &#147;Income Statement Extraordinary and Unusual Items&#148;.
	This standard eliminates the concept of extraordinary and unusual items from U.S. GAAP. The new standard is effective for annual and interim periods after December 15, 2015. Early adoption is permitted. Navios Acquisition plans to adopt this
	standard effective January 1, 2016. The adoption of the new standard is not expected to have a material impact on the Company&#146;s results of operations, financial position or cash flows.

	In August 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-15, &#147;Presentation of Financial Statements-Going Concern (Subtopic 205-40): Disclosure of Uncertainties About
	an Entity&#146;s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern&#148;. This standard requires management to assess an entity&#146;s ability to continue as a going concern, and to provide related footnote disclosures in certain circumstances. Before this new
	standard, no accounting guidance existed for management on when and how to assess or disclose going concern uncertainties. The amendments are effective for annual periods ending after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within annual periods
	beginning after December 15, 2016. Early application is permitted. The Company plans to adopt this standard effective January&nbsp;1, 2017. The adoption of the new standard is not expected to have a material impact on the Company&#146;s results of

	In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09 &#147;Revenue from Contracts with Customers&#148; clarifying the
	method used to determine the timing and requirements for revenue recognition on the statements of operations. Under the new standard, an entity must identify the performance obligations in a contract, the transaction price and allocate the price to
	specific performance obligations to recognize the revenue when the obligation is completed. The amendments in this update also require disclosure of sufficient information to allow users to understand the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of
	revenue and cash flow arising from contracts. The new accounting guidance was originally effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016. On July 9, 2015, the FASB finalized a one-year deferral of the effective date for
	the new revenue standard. The standard will be effective for public entities for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017 and interim periods therein. The Company is currently reviewing the effect of ASU No. 2014-09 on its revenue
	recognition.
