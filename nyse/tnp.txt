	The shipping industry uses time charter equivalent, or TCE, to calculate revenues per vessel in dollars per day for vessels on voyage charters. The industry does this because it does not commonly express charter rates
	for vessels on voyage charters in dollars per day. TCE allows vessel operators to compare the revenues of vessels that are on voyage charters with those on time charters. TCE is a non-GAAP measure. For vessels on voyage charters, we calculate TCE by
	taking revenues earned on the voyage and deducting the voyage expenses (bunker fuel, port expenses, canal dues, charter commissions) and dividing by the actual number of voyage days. For vessels on bareboat charter, for which we do not incur either
	voyage or operation costs, we calculate TCE by taking revenues earned on the charter and adding a representative amount for vessel operating expenses. TCE differs from average daily revenue earned in that TCE is based on revenues after voyage
	expenses and does not take into account off-hire days.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	The tanker market enjoyed its highest earnings in over seven years in 2015, benefitting directly from lower oil prices. The sharp decline in the price of oil
	since the second half of 2014 was this time driven by a global crude oversupply, rather than a decline in demand which was the driver behind the last sharp drop in oil prices during the financial crisis of 2008-2009. The crude surplus and low oil
	prices of 2015 triggered a multitude of beneficial demand factors for the tanker market which included record consumption growth in some parts of the world, strategic and commercial crude and oil product stockbuilding demand, floating storage plays,
	exceptionally high refining runs, infrastructure bottlenecks leading to vessel delivery delays and many more. The added demand for tanker tonnage also allowed tanker owners to hold on to the benefit of the lower cost of bunker fuels (which are
	highly correlated with crude oil). Furthermore, this strong upward shift in tanker demand occurred during a year of low fleet growth in most sectors, which allowed for freight rates to rise sharply.

	Brent crude lost approximately 77% of its value from its $115/bbl peak in June 2014 to a low of just above $26/bbl in mid-January 2016. Despite a temporary
	resurgence in both Brent and WTI prices during Q2-2015, at the end of June world powers and Iran reached an agreement that would see sanctions soon lifted on the country which, combined with rising crude supply elsewhere, triggered a pronounced
	sell-off that tailed off into 2016. US crude production remained unexpectedly high, while OPEC&#146;s two largest members, Saudi Arabia and Iraq, boosted their combined production by over 1&nbsp;million bpd over the year. Concerns of a weakening
	Chinese economy has also brought the price of oil under pressure, particularly in August 2015, as oil prices traded below $40/bbl for the first time since early 2009 and again in late December after periods of high volatility on the Shanghai Stock
	Exchange. The lifting of sanctions on Iran became effective in mid-January 2016, eventually pushing prices down further to bottom out below $30/bbl.

	WTI switched to trade at a premium to Brent during the last days of 2015, following the lifting of the 40-year
	old US crude export ban. As a slightly higher quality crude in terms of API gravity and sulphur content, WTI should logically trade at a premium to Brent, but its landlocked nature amid booming domestic production has led it to trade at a discount
	since the so-called &#147;shale revolution&#148;. The WTI discount to Brent has been re-established as the US crude has yet to emerge as a major export grade. Export infrastructure in the US Gulf coast, the natural crude export hub for US crude,
	falling US crude production, and a lack of demand amid the ongoing crude surplus has limited US crude&#146;s global reach and has for now kept it largely landlocked. Possible crude export markets for US crude could be Latin America, particularly
	Venezuela for blending purposes, Europe where it could compete with light, sweet West African crude and potentially Asia where both US condensate and some very high quality crude can be used for condensate splitting. The greater the export demand
	for the crude, the more WTI will appreciate in value relative to other grades. US domestic refineries, however, would prefer for the WTI discount to remain to continue providing them with a feedstock cost advantage relative to their international
	competitors.

	The IEA estimates that the crude oversupply in 2015 averaged 2m bpd, with a global crude stockbuilding rate estimated at around
	1.4&nbsp;million bpd (all IEA data captured last from the February 2016 report). Stocks in some areas approached near capacity; for example in Cushing, US, stocks rose to 64.2&nbsp;million bbls &#150; only 0.8&nbsp;million bbls below the operational
	capacity of the Cushing storage facilities. Stocks in other areas, notably China and India, were expanded as part of a long-term strategic plan but the low crude prices also helped to encourage that strategic and other commercial stockbuilding. As
	of the February update, the IEA is estimating that the crude surplus will remain at around 2&nbsp;million bpd in Q1-2016, fall to 1.5&nbsp;million bpd in Q2-2016 and then sharply narrow in the second half of the year to average 0.3&nbsp;million bpd
	&#150; leaving the year with an average surplus of approximately 1&nbsp;million bpd.

	Total OECD crude stocks reached 1,119.3&nbsp;million barrels at the
	end of 2015, nearly a 15% year-on-year increase from 2014. The largest build was witnessed in the OECD Americas where stocks built by 93.2&nbsp;million bbls. Stocks in OECD Europe rose by 36.5&nbsp;million bbls and by 25&nbsp;million bbls in OECD
	Asia Oceania. Middle distillate stocks rose by 87&nbsp;million bbls in all OECD regions, the largest gain was in Europe but this was closely followed by the Americas, amid slowing global demand growth for the fuel and high output from refiners who
	raised their products output in order to capture firmer gasoline margins but leaving large surpluses of middle distillates to be stockpiled. Gasoline stocks were the only type to fall year-on-year as demand growth accelerated - since the primary
	buyers of gasoline are individual consumers for passenger car use this makes the fuel much more elastic (i.e. demand will respond to lower prices) than gasoil, which relates more to industrial demand. OECD fuel oil stocks also rose by a smaller
	16.4&nbsp;million bbls.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	In 2015, Chinese stockbuilding reached its highest level yet at an average of 670,000 bpd for the year. This jump in
	stockbuilding activity was attributable to a one-time build in refinery stocks after the government issued a rule whereby refineries had to maintain crude oil inventories of at least 15 days when international crude prices are below $130/bbl and at

	OPEC
	production rose by 1.07&nbsp;million bpd in 2015 as the organization agreed in November 2014 and re-affirmed in June 2015 not to cut production to lift prices. At the most recent OPEC bi-annual meeting in December 2015 the organization decided to
	forgo a production ceiling altogether as they welcomed back Indonesia and as the uncertainty surrounding Iranian production growth following the lifting of sanctions raised questions over the correct level of the ceiling. This decision was largely
	viewed as symbolic as OPEC had been pumping well above its 30&nbsp;million bpd ceiling for many months. Recently, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Venezuela, Qatar and Russia agreed to freeze production at January 2016 levels which, at the time of writing,
	has done little to stifle a rise in oil prices as oil production from those countries was not expected to rise much above January 2016 levels anyway in the year, or in some cases was expected to even fall. Iran and Iraq have so far not committed to
	an output freeze.

	developments. First, the benchmark Basrah crude was split into a Heavy and Light grade in May which improved the consistency of the oil Iraq sent to its customers and enabled a rise in the Heavy stream outflow. Second, with support from improved
	pipeline infrastructure and greater autonomy, production from the autonomous Kurdistan region grew from an average of 200,000 bpd in 2012 and 2013 to average 550,000 bpd in 2015. Saudi Arabia was the second-largest contributor to OPEC production
	growth with output rising year-on-year by 450,000 bpd in 2015. The UAE and Angola were the only other OPEC members (apart from Iran) to boost year-on-year output, by 100,000 bpd and 120,000 bpd respectively.

	At the end of June 2015, Iran and the P5+1

	mid-January 2016, however US sanctions tied to non-nuclear related issues remain on a number of Iranian entities and individuals. Subsequently, Iran has vehemently promised to boost crude output by 500,000 bpd within months of sanctions being lifted
	in the hopes of restoring output to pre-sanction levels of just below 4&nbsp;million bpd from a 2015 average of 2.86&nbsp;million bpd. The IEA expects Iranian output to rise by around 600,000 bpd in 2016, further boosting OPEC&#146;s market share as

	forecasted decline in non-OPEC production will be more than offset by an expected rise in OPEC production &#150; driven by Iran. OPEC production is expected to rise by more than 700,000 bpd in 2016, leaving total global crude production relatively
	flat year-on-year at 96.5&nbsp;million bpd - roughly 100,000 bpd higher than 2015 output. On the other hand, the IEA expects demand growth to average 1.2&nbsp;million bpd in 2015, down from 1.6&nbsp;million bpd last year, which leaves the 2016

	US crude output peaked in April 2015 at 13.24&nbsp;million bpd, and averaged
	12.92&nbsp;million bpd for the year. Output in the US is expected to fall by about 500,000 bpd this year as the resilient US oil industry, populated by many independent producers, only began to see consecutive month-on-month declines at the very end
	of 2015. Buoyant production from the US Gulf of Mexico delayed the fall in total US production; output in the Gulf of Mexico rose by 142,000 bpd in 2015 with similar growth expected again this year. By mid-January 2016 the total number of active
	rigs in the US stood at 515, 68% below the peak in October 2014. Meanwhile production from new wells drilled has fallen to less than 240,000 bpd which is behind legacy declines of more than 350,000 bpd. The lifting of the crude export ban is not
	expected to lead to a rise in US crude production for export while global oil prices remain low and there is a persistent oversupply. The decline in US crude production, however, is expected to boost seaborne imports into the country. The small and
	entrepreneurial independent producers that characterize much of the US shale oil industry are likely to boost output again at the first sign of a rise in oil prices which makes a large part of US production very elastic.

	In the wake of low oil prices, many countries
	took advantage of this position to either reduce subsidies or increase environmental disincentives for oil consumption as the low oil price reduced clean energy&#146;s cost competitiveness and induced heavy oil demand growth that if left unabated
	could cause serious pollution damage. These measures can be considered as artificial demand caps, reducing otherwise natural demand growth. Some examples include a handful of Mideast Gulf countries (Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, the UAE) reducing their
	generous fuel subsidies to bring relief to their strained budgets, India and Indonesia sharply reducing or completely removing fuel subsides, China imposing a freeze on fuel prices when crude oil falls below $40/bbl, India banning new luxury diesel
	vehicles in Delhi and imposing a green tax on commercial vehicles in the city and more recently Venezuela relaxing its heavy fuel subsidies. The IEA advises that the expected demand growth risk is tilted towards the downside amid weak emerging and
	oil producing nation economies and an expected steady rise in oil, and fuel, prices as the year progresses. That being said, other industry watchers have a more optimistic view and it would not be the first time early year forecasts would prove

	Chinese oil demand rose to an average of 11.18&nbsp;million bpd this past year, an increase of 570,000 bpd or approximately 5.3% from
	2014. This outpaced demand growth in 2014 of 300,000 bpd, but is in line with recent annual growth of 3-5% since growing by 11% in 2010 and at similar levels in prior years. Demand is expected to slow in 2016 to a growth rate of 3%, reflecting
	decelerating GDP growth and a number of government efforts (mentioned previously as artificial demand caps) that are stemming oil demand growth in an effort to reduce pollution. Chinese refining capacity expanded by approximately 650,000 bpd in
	2015, this comprised of three state-owned refineries each totaling 100,000 bpd and 350,000 bpd of teapot expansions. Most Chinese refinery expansions in 2016 have been delayed as refiners instead focus on upgrading capacity to meet the 2017 change

	An
	important development this past year worth mentioning is independent, or teapot, refineries being given the ability to process and directly import crude in place of fuel oil. A reported total of 12 independent refiners have been given crude
	processing quotas by February 2016 totaling just over 1&nbsp;million bpd, while most have also been allocated direct crude import quotas. In order to receive these quotas the independent refiners had to reduce inefficient capacity, build a certain
	level of stocks, and comply with other efficiency-promoting requirements. The independent refiners constitute a new source of crude demand, but they are at the mercy of reduced fuel oil demand as fuel oil was their previous feedstock, and will
	therefore add to Chinese crude demand this year as they did at the latter end of 2015. However, independent refineries have a lower utilization on average than their state-owned counterparts, despite utilization with crude oil feedstock an
	improvement from fuel oil, and so it is doubtful that the full quotas will be utilized.

	Growth in emerging and developing markets declined for the fifth consecutive year, with many of those economies drawing a
	large portion of their finances from commodities, while advanced economies continued to embark on a slow recovery. The fall in oil prices driven by the oversupply should supposedly support global demand as a result of the higher propensity to spend
	in oil importing countries relative to oil exporting countries, but a number of factors have reduced the otherwise positive impact. The IMF cited financial woes in many oil exporters limiting their ability to smoothen the shock of the drop in oil
	prices, leading to a significant fall in their domestic demand. The fall in oil price has sharply reduced an entire industry&#146;s level of investment, itself a contribution to global demand growth. The IMF expects global GDP growth to pick up to
	3.4% in 2016 and 3.6% in 2017. In the long term, the &#147;lower for longer&#148; oil price phenomenon has reduced oil industry investment to a point where the global economy could witness skyrocketing oil prices later down the line.

	As importing regions, China and India continued to be the driving force behind crude ton-mile demand growth. The approximate
	540,000 bpd year-on-year rise in Chinese seaborne volumes in 2015 came from a combination of Middle Eastern, east coast South American and Russian volumes (only a small portion of the rise in total Russian flows was non-seaborne). Saudi Arabia only
	met 4% of China&#146;s increase in crude appetite last year, with Kuwait, Iraq and Oman gaining more of a foothold boosting their shipments by 80,000 bpd, 70,000 bpd and 50,000 bpd respectively. Russian exports to the far eastern nation rose by an
	equivalent amount to Middle Eastern volumes (excluding Saudi Arabia) &#150; this was in large part due to rising Kozmino ESPO crude loadings and China&#146;s independent refineries&#146; healthy appetite for the grade. Previously limited to
	Aframaxes, the Kozmino export terminal began loading Suezmaxes in November 2015 with loadings at the terminal reportedly climbing more than 20% year-on-year. Generating the greatest boost in ton-mile growth, however, would be the 140,000 bpd
	year-on-year gain in east coast South America flows to China which was wholly provided for by Brazil as Argentinean flows remained flat at 10,000 bpd. The greatest annual fall in volumes occurred from West Africa, a fall of 90,000 bpd, due to a
	decline in imports from Angola, Congo, Equatorial Guinea and Nigeria as Europe took more West African crude to feed their surge in refining runs but also as West Africa struggled to sell their crude amid the global oil glut.

	The rise in Indian ton-miles was a result of increased flows from Mexico, Saudi Arabia and West Africa &#150; but
	mileage growth was certainly impeded by a 90,000 bpd year-on-year fall in volumes from the Caribs in 2015. Overall, Indian crude imports grew only 2% year-on-year to 3.92&nbsp;million bpd, but in 2014 import volumes actually fell year-on-year and so
	2015 volumes were less than 1% or 20,000 bpd higher than in 2013. A lack of new Indian refining capacity was behind the low growth in crude volumes flowing into India, the 300,000 bpd Paradip refinery was scheduled to come online in 2015, after
	being delayed from 2013, but is now coming online in March 2016. The refinery is expected to take 60% Mexican Mayan crude, but is also thought to be capable of taking West African grades. India was a consistent buyer of West African crudes,
	particularly as they were depressed this year with a number of cargoes leftover at the end of each month attracting favorable discounts. India was also a strong buyer of Iraqi volumes, the country&#146;s imports from Basrah rose by 170,000 bpd as
	reportedly the 9.7&nbsp;million bbl Visakhapatnam SPR on the western coast of the country was filled with predominantly Iraqi crude.

	2015 saw also a
	noticeable pick up in European crude ton-mile demand growth as refiners there greatly benefitted from the fall in crude prices relative to the pick-up in products demand. The EU28 seaborne volumes rose almost 6% to 9.38&nbsp;million bpd while
	Russian pipeline volumes to the region only rose by 70,000 bpd. European refining runs rose by just under 700,000 bpd with the surge in refining margins bringing long-awaited relief to the region&#146;s ailing downstream sector. The 510,000 bpd rise
	in seaborne imports was predominantly due to a rise in flows from the Middle East Gulf, the Eastern Mediterranean and West Africa. Iraqi flows into the EU28 rose by an astounding 270,000 bpd as volumes from Libya and Saudi Arabia waned. Angola was
	the primary benefactor in West Africa from the boost in runs, while in the East Mediterranean the EU28 took 120,000 bpd of more crude from Azerbaijan and in Latin America Mexico was the only country to see year-on-year export growth to the EU28 of
	70,000 bpd.

	Although US domestic production began to fall in 2015, seaborne imports continued to trend downwards, albeit at a slower pace than in 2014,
	falling 200,000 bpd year-on-year. Imports from Canada to the US, however, continued to grow, to the detriment of seaborne volumes, rising by almost 200,000 bpd. Other rises in crude flows into the US were from Latin America, principally Colombia and
	Ecuador, while imports continued to fall from the Mideast Gulf and West Africa although volumes from Iraq more than doubled in Q4-2015 to average 350,000 bpd while imports from Angola rose 60,000 bpd in Q3-2015 and another 30,000 bpd in Q4-2015.
	Going forward, US seaborne imports are poised to rise as domestic output is expected to fall in 2016 while WTI could strengthen relative to Brent as domestic output falls.

	2015 was an extraordinary year for crude flows by virtue of the immense oversupply, this however has only temporarily delayed the long-term trend of refinery
	closures in major importing regions including Europe, Japan, and Australia in place of more efficient refineries in the Mideast Gulf and Asia. In the case of the Mideast Gulf, the area is expected to increasingly see higher value-added product
	exports in place of crude exports. However, in the short-term refining runs in crude importing regions remain relatively supported by the continued low oil price and healthy oil demand. The healthy oil demand included stockbuilding activity, while
	low oil prices also dramatically encouraged competitive and opportunistic buying and increased trading/blending activity, supporting ton-mile growth. Meantime, in line with long-term strategies, Asian crude buyers continue to widen their buying
	palate away from the Mideast Gulf to longer-haul destinations, particularly Latin America, which supported crude tanker ton-mile growth.

	Retail gasoline prices in the US have fallen by over 50% from July 2014, incentivizing Americans to drive a record 283.749
	billion miles in July 2015. Consequently, US gasoline imports during the third quarter were 747,000 bpd, almost 40% higher than during the same period last year despite domestic refineries running at full capacity. There were also slight upticks in
	distillate and kerosene imports in 2015 compared to 2014, which was aided by cold winter weather in Q1-2015 despite refineries shoveling significant amounts into storage towards the end of the year as the warmer than usual winter weather in Q4-2015
	did not generate enough demand growth. Despite Europe being inundated by diesel imports from the Middle East, Russia and Asia &#150; along with their own surging output due to high refining runs &#150; the US managed to also boost distillate exports
	to the region, however at the start of 2016 the arbitrage had come under increasing pressure due to an oversupply of distillates on both sides of the Atlantic.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Perhaps the most notable event of the past year for the US downstream sector occurred at the end of 2015 with the lifting of the US crude export ban. The
	refining industry has been against a lifting of the crude ban as it would make US crude grades exportable, thereby removing their landlocked discount &#150; propagated by the US shale revolution &#150; and eroding US refiners&#146; advantageous
	feedstock cost. As mentioned, WTI switched to trade at a premium to Brent for a few weeks following the lifting of the ban, but by the time of writing it had switched back to trade at a discount to Brent. Reasons for this include limited ability for
	US crude exports to be realized due to insufficient export infrastructure, and an already oversupplied crude market and therefore little demand opportunity, while many US grades have a very light, sweet quality which makes it more likely to be sold
	in smaller cargoes (in addition to export infrastructure limiting cargo size). Moreover, it is only reasonable to expect a decline in US refining runs in the case of a decline in US oil demand growth &#150; however this is not forecasted to be the
	case yet. Oil demand in Latin America, to which the US sends most of its product exports, will also prevent a decline in runs. Therefore, it can be expected that the US will continue to see greater product exports in place of imports, as it has
	since the shale oil revolution, although in the longer term US refineries will be subject to competition from the more efficient, modern refineries coming online in the Mideast Gulf and Asia.

	Refining margins peaked in the summer, reaching an average of $9.75/bbl on the US Gulf coast in July and
	$6.97/bbl in Europe &#150; their highest monthly averages since at least 2012. European refiners were particularly pleased after many months in recent years of negative margins in the region, as reported by the IEA. As a result, European refinery
	autumn refinery maintenance fell to its lowest in nine years, averaging just over 200,000 bpd compared to a 2007-2013 average of almost 1m bpd. Autumn refinery maintenance was also reduced in 2014 to under 600,000 bpd. The two years of delays will
	inevitably spell a very heavy maintenance period in the near future &#150; perhaps at a time when the market can least afford it, i.e. this could lead to a larger than usual reduction in European crude demand during autumn seasonal maintenance at a
	time when the crude tanker market is weak.

	The boost in margins has lent itself to temporarily relieve the long ailing and oversupplied European refining
	sector, but the long-term reduction in capacity has not been avoided. Total is still planning to halve capacity at its 222,000 bpd Lindsey refinery in 2016, while despite union protests their 153,000 bpd La Mede refinery, outside Marseille, will be
	converted into France&#146;s first bio-refinery of 10,000 bpd and will stop refining crude oil at the end of 2016. ENI will also convert its 100,000 bpd Gela refinery in Sicily into a bio-refinery which is expected to be completed in 2016 with the
	first production of biodiesel. Finally, it has recently been announced that Phillip&#146;s 66 is again looking for a buyer for its 71,000 bpd Whitegate refinery on the south coast of Ireland, if no buyer is found it may close. In Australia, BP
	closed the 102,000 bpd Bulwer refinery in Brisbane which leaves the country with four refineries at a combined capacity of 444,000 bpd, from a countrywide capacity of 844,000 bpd in 2003. In Asia, CPC closed the 220,000 bpd Kaohsiung refinery in
	Taiwan which removed substantial gasoil supplies from the Asia-Pacific region. Finally, a long-term refinery reduction plan that continues apace is that of Japan. Petrobras closed their 100,000 bpd Nishihara refinery in 2015, while the country needs
	to close another 400,000 bpd of capacity to reduce Japan&#146;s total refining capacity to 3.45&nbsp;million bpd under a government mandate to reconcile the downstream sector with dwindling domestic oil demand. To address the remaining 400,000 bpd
	closures, Japan&#146;s top refineries have announced merger plans with each other and streamlining of adjacent refineries.

	Two giant refineries in the
	Middle East Gulf came online nearly simultaneously during the summer of 2015, although both suffered some minor intermittent start-up problems. The two refineries boosted volumes for particularly LR tonnage out of the region destined for Europe,
	Asia and Australia as the country became more reliant on product imports following the refinery closures. The two refineries were the 416,000 bpd Ruwais expansion in the UAE and the 400,000 bpd Yanbu Yasref refinery on the Red Sea. The Yanbu
	refinery processes crude from a new oil field, thereby not reducing crude export volumes, and has become a major supplier of high specification diesel to Europe. Further expanding Middle Eastern refining muscle are two projects in Iran, the first
	was a small 30,000 bpd expansion at the 320,000 bpd Bandar Abbas refinery at the end of 2015 while a new 300,000 bpd refinery is due in Q2-2015 also in Bandar Abbas called the Persian Gulf Star that will produce mainly gasoline, Iran&#146;s only net
	product import. NNPC, the state-owned Nigerian oil company, has also been eagerly expanding domestic refining capacity in an effort to cut the country&#146;s product import bill. Three existing refineries, the 210,000 bpd Port Harcourt, 125,000 bpd
	Warri and 110,000 bpd Kaduna refinery have however been plagued by a number of start-up problems for several months and so remain out of commission which will support product imports into the country from primarily Europe, but also the US.

	High refinery output in the west, encouraged by lofty margins, kept the west in surplus of naphtha and continued to support the west/east naphtha trade. Arb
	volumes, and freight demand, was particularly strong during the summer months, peaking in August just short of 2&nbsp;million tons, as refineries in the west were running at near full capacity as margins reached their peaks for the year on the back
	of strong gasoline demand. In September, arb volumes dropped sharply in part due to problems at some petrochemical facilities in the Far East, weaker gasoline margins and as seasonal maintenance in the Far East set in. Despite west/east naphtha arb
	volumes climbing well above August highs of 2&nbsp;million tons in January, the backlog of tonnage in the Middle East Gulf has prevented a similar strengthening in freight as it did in the summer. Far eastern demand for naphtha is expected to
	continue coming from China as they add an estimated 296,000 bpd of reforming capacity this year to meet China 5 fuel standards by the start of 2017, while runs in the west are expected to remain relatively high

	VLCC fleet growth remained low in 2015, growing at a year-on-year rate of 2.8% after rising by 2.4% in 2014 and 2.1% in 2013. Years of consecutive low fleet
	growth have enabled a more pronounced freight response to the recent changes in demand. Lower fleet growth in 2015 was attributable to a low level of additions at only 18 vessels while 3 VLCCs were removed from the trading fleet which were all
	converted to floating storage units &#150; this is less than the 9 and 17 vessels that were removed in 2013 and 2014, respectively, as the tight market found employment for several older vessels while the buoyant market and dropping scrap steel
	prices dissuaded scrapping. Slippage in 2015 was 25%, slightly less than the 2009-2014 average of 27.6%, as the well performing markets encouraged ships to be taken on time. The removal of the three floating storage units (&#147;FSUs&#148;) from the

	growth up to 6.7% - the highest since 2011. The current orderbook translates into heavy fleet growth over the next couple of years as well, with a reasonable expectation for heavy removals towards the end of the decade as many VLCCs turn over the

	Suezmax fleet growth is also expected to have experienced its last consecutive year of low fleet growth of 1.4% after contracting in 2014 at a

	slippage for 2015 was a low 10% compared to the 2009-2014 average of 43%. The average age of the 3 removed Suezmaxes was 18 years old, although one ship was less than 10 years old and was the only one not to be scrapped but converted into an FSU.

	Handy product tanker fleet growth (27,000 dwt &#150; 45,000 dwt) broke its five-year contraction streak in 2015, growing at a rate of 2.3%. In 2015 there was
	both a rise in additions and a fall in removals compared to 2014; 39 ships were added to the fleet with 20 removed which equates to a net fleet growth of 19 vessels. Slippage in 2015 was a very low 2.5%, only 1 vessel slipped into 2016, this
	compares to an average slippage between 2009-2014 of 33.3%. As at the 1

	st
</SUP>
	of January 2016, the orderbook for the current year stood at 54 vessels, applying average slippage since 2009 of 28.9%
	this translates into an expected 2016 delivery schedule of 38 which, against expected removals of 20 driven mainly by age, leads to a similar net fleet growth in 2016 of 2.2%. As additions to the fleet fall slightly going forward and as removals
	accelerate due to the aging fleet (about 14% of the fleet is over 20 years old, although Handy trading is flexible in terms of age), fleet growth is, unlike the crude and LR sectors, expected to continue to fall but remain positive over the next few
	years.

	In 2015, a total of 73 VLCCs were ordered &#150; the most in at least the past four years. Over half of the
	orders were made in the second half of the year as earnings continued to strengthen, newbuilding prices remained attractive and as the impending IMO Tier III engine standard that came into place at the start of 2016 would add an extra cost of $2-$4
	million, encouraging purchases in 2015 that may have otherwise been made later. 3 VLCCs were ordered in the first month of 2016, bringing the total orderbook to 138 against a fleet of 656 at the time of writing.

	Similarly, strong crude earnings encouraged heavy Suezmax ordering in 2015 with a total of 79 orders as at the end of 2015 that will deliver on the back of
	the smaller Suezmax fleet, which at the time of writing totals 435 vessels. Over a third of the orders were made in the fourth quarter of the year with mainly South Korean shipbuilders throughout 2015, although almost a third were made with Chinese
	shipbuilders during the year. Despite the marked fall in VLCC (South Korean) newbuilding prices, Suezmax newbuilding prices stayed relatively stable throughout the year &#150; dipping to $64m for two months in September and ending the year back at
	$65m. So far in 2016, Suezmax ordering continues to outpace VLCC ordering with a total of 4 Suezmaxes ordered in the first month of the year, bringing the total orderbook up to 129 vessels at the time of writing.

	Aframax ordering in 2015 was no different, a total of 30 uncoated and 99 coated LR2s were ordered. In 2014 a total of 9 uncoated and 15 coated LR2s were put
	on order, but the high LR2 figure is not completely stand alone as 85 coated LR2s were ordered during 2013. Aframax ordering jumped in Q2-2015 and stayed high for the rest of the year as average annual earnings were almost double levels from 2014
	and as (South Korean) newbuilding prices fell by $1 million, although keeping in mind the effect of the USD appreciation throughout 2015. Most recently, newbuilding prices have fallen by a further $1 million since the start of the year, 5 Aframaxes
	(believed to be uncoated) have since been ordered during January 2016 bringing the total orderbook to 192 against a fleet of 901 vessels (coated and uncoated) at the time of writing. Even though the majority of orders are specified as fully coated
	vessels, uncoated vessels can still be switched to fully coated before construction ends while for a short time uncoated vessels can trade clean for their very first voyages, although they will have to revert to dirty trades so as the refined
	products do not significantly erode their uncoated tanks.

	MR ordering in 2015 was non-existent in Q1-2015, and only showed a total of 3 orders in Q2-2015
	as the market took a breather from the vigorous eco-MR driven ordering from 2013 when 226 vessels were ordered. Despite the absence of newbuilding orders, prices actually increased in February 2015 to $37 million but shortly later sunk down to $36.5
	million where they remained until July, they only declined later in the year to fall by $0.7m year-on-year as the market instead seemed to favor secondhand vessels. Earnings in the first three quarters of 2015 were at least double than during the
	same period last year which must have encouraged some orders despite the intense focus there seems to have been on crude ordering during the year. Throughout 2015, a total of 98 MRs were ordered, 95 of which were ordered in the second half of the
	year. There were only 2 MR orders in January 2016, which brings the orderbook to tally at 202 against a fleet of 1301 at the time of writing.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Despite the
	vast majority of annual tanker earnings in 2015 reaching their highest level since 2008, the same magnitude of rise was not reflected in newbuilding prices which lent itself to encourage high level of particularly crude and LR ordering witnessed
	last year. It could be argued that market players were intent instead on capturing the current market which limited the price appreciation on vessels that would not be delivering for another two years at least. In addition, it has been shown that
	years of strong earnings typically lead to years of high ordering, while the introduction of the IMO Tier III engine standard come 2016 also may have pushed some orders to happen in 2015 that may have otherwise happened later. Conversions from the
	dry bulk market into tanker orders also continued in 2015, there were estimated to be almost 40 dry conversions in 2015 and a handful of LNG conversions into tanker orders.

	On the whole, tanker earnings had an extraordinary earnings streak last year due to a combination of surging demand for oil, and thus tankers, in the low price
	environment, low fleet supply growth in most sectors and a lower bunker cost. Year-on-year, VLCC earnings doubled (basis TD3 Middle East/Japan), Suezmax earnings rose 78% (basis TD20 West Africa/Northwest Europe) and Aframax earnings rose 47% (basis
	the HRP Aframax composite). Apart from January 2015 on the HRP Aframax Composite, earnings on the three crude benchmarks averaged higher every month of 2015 than the corresponding 2014 month. Both a cold early winter in early 2015 and the
	continuation of a low oil price environment following OPEC&#146;s pivotal meeting at the end of November 2014 kept crude tanker earnings on their upward march that had started in Q4-2014. Q2-2015 was the strongest quarter-on-quarter earnings period
	- usually the spring months are a seasonal lull for crude tankers while refinery maintenance is in full swing in Europe and Asia, however, this time all three crude tanker benchmarks were more than double from Q2-2014 earnings as refineries worked
	to run near full capacity and capture booming gasoline demand growth during the peak demand season. This also led to surpluses of fuel oil among other products to be carried on tankers. Earnings again trended higher during the third quarter, but
	largely due to a very strong July as earnings then seasonally fell with refinery maintenance limiting demand later that quarter. Exceptional earnings in October and December on the VLCCs, and consistently strong earnings on the Suezmaxes and
	Aframaxes ensured a strong finish to the year for crude tanker earnings which were up almost 50% on the VLCCs, and over 15% on Suezmaxes and Aframaxes year-on-year compared to the also strong Q4-2014.

	As already explained, the low oil price environment sparked a multitude of positive demand factors for the tanker market but in addition it has also lead to a
	reduction in the primary voyage cost for shipowners: bunkers. Bunker prices fell to an annual low at the very end of the year but then have continued to fall to a 12-year low around mid-January 2016 of just above $100/ton (Rotterdam IFO380) as Brent
	fell below $30/bbl. The reduction in bunkers from their highs of over $600/ton in the first half of 2014 to well under $200/ton at the end of 2015 reduced the percentage of bunkers over gross freight (basis TD3 Middle East/Japan) from over 80% to
	under 20%, which means that after paying for bunker costs, shipowners had 80% or more leftover to cover other costs and hold as profit as opposed to under 20% which was the case when bunker prices were above $600/ton in 2013-14. The importance of
	the fall in bunker price in relation to earnings cannot be highlighted enough. The low

	Although supply growth is picking up in 2016 and for the next couple of years thereafter, fleet growth at the moment remains supportive as heavy deliveries on
	VLCCs, the first sector to reach peak fleet growth, are not expected to impact the market until the end of the year and into early 2017. Therefore, earnings this year will remain supported by slowly building crude supply growth, continued strong oil
	demand growth and low bunker prices. That being said, the crude oil oversupply is projected to narrow come Q3-2016 and so oil prices, and by extension bunker prices, are expected to steadily pick up eventually eating into tanker earnings. In
	addition, the boon in oil prices that was propagated from the plunge in oil prices has now been factored into demand growth, oil prices cannot fall by another $50/bbl when they are already at ~$30/bbl. This, among other factors such as lower demand
	in oil producing nations, lower industrial demand, removal of subsidies in some countries, etc. has lowered the oil demand growth outlook for 2016 and onwards. Floating storage remains a possibility pending a widening of both the crude and now
	products contango, in Northwest Europe the gasoil contango has strengthened markedly since the build-up of supply due to a mild winter, low Rhine water levels keeping the product trapped along the coast and an influx of cargoes from the Mideast
	Gulf, Russia, the US and Asia. If floating storage once again becomes viable, it will act as a floor to the market. Finally, the possibility of slowing down tanker speed to stem fleet supply growth is for the most part out of the question as low
	bunker prices do not justify slowing down until the market reaches very low levels.

	The products sector likewise started out on a strong note in 2015 as
	earnings for the year were approximately $10,000/day higher on the HRP MR Selected Composite and similar annual gains were made in the LR market. The two new Middle Eastern refineries that came online provided significant cargo volume for LRs, while
	a cold start to 2015 and strong gasoline demand globally kept the fleet busy from the start of the year to the end of summer. However, this annual gain would have been higher without the weakness exhibited in Q4-2015, which was the only quarter to
	record lower earnings compared to the same quarter in 2014. Product earnings did also receive a boost from the lower bunker price while Worldscale rates stagnated at lower levels due to a number of factors including a build-up in LR tonnage in the
	Middle East Gulf after a strong naphtha arbitrage during the summer, limiting any breakaways in LR freight from the region, a build-up in product stocks on both sides of the Atlantic bringing both the diesel and gasoline arbitrages between the
	regions under pressure, and of course the immense MR fleet growth in 2015 which did not bring earnings crashing down but certainly added to supply during the year. As DPP earnings rose relative to CPP earnings the percentage of fully coated vessels
	trading DPP inched during 2015, exhibiting the ability of switching to act as a &#147;cap&#148; to earnings on both sides of the market.

	Buoyed by a spur
	storage play excitement, VLCC earnings (TD3 Middle East/Japan) rose slightly from December 2014 to average just over $73,000/day in January 2015 as 1-year TC rates rose to $42,500/day in the third week of the month. A lot of floating storage
	interest was generated when the Brent 12-month contango widened to above $10/bbl, prompting many to include a storage option in their TC arrangements or take vessels specifically to store. All of the earnings stated above and in subsequent comments
	are basis the HRP standard speed and consumption assumptions ~ 12-13 knots which we also refer to as Slow Steaming. The market fell seasonally in February and March, leaving earnings for the quarter to average over $58,000/day. Earnings in Q2 were
	extremely robust, averaging almost $63,000/day &#150; almost four times the Q2-2014 average &#150; especially considering it is a seasonally weak period of the year for the VLCC market. The strength continued into Q3-2015 where earnings averaged
	above $57,115/day as refineries in most parts of the world, particularly in the US and Europe, ran at as high utilization rates as possible to capture high refining margins. VLCC earnings, however, dropped quite sharply in August as Chinese buying
	dropped by about 1&nbsp;million bpd with a sharp fall in implied stockbuilding activity, and in fact a very slight drawdown in crude stocks. A notable tightness in prompt supply in the Mideast Gulf in October boosted earnings for the month, which
	was later explained by a record for the year Chinese imports for the month of December, which would be roughly when the vessels would arrive from the Middle East. Meanwhile, the increasing amount of crude that is being transported around the world
	has congested infrastructure in many parts of the world, tying up supply and then contributing to temporary shortages of available vessels. These port delays, as opposed to weather delays, again helped to push TD3 to average over $100,000/day in
	December 2015 &#150; bringing the seasonally strong Q4-2015 average above $83,000/day. Once again the explanation for the rush of demand transpired with a new record high import level being set for Chinese imports arriving in February at
	8&nbsp;million bpd.

	The fall in oil prices encouraged strong stockbuilding activity yet again in China, and coincided with minimal
	stockbuilding in India with the opening of the Visakhapatnam SPR on the west coast. Overall, the low oil price invigorated the global seaborne oil trade: sometimes aggressive pricing by producing nations led regions to import certain grades of crude
	they would not otherwise purchase, purchasing became more opportunistic and experimental, while lower oil prices continued to support strong refinery demand. VLCC crude and DPP seaborne volumes rose in 2015 to the tune of 4.7%, or 900,000 bpd, from
	a decline of -130,000 bpd in 2014 mainly related to DPP (mainly Fuel Oil).

	&#150; more than twice the average of 2014. So far this year, VLCC earnings have averaged only slightly down after December&#146;s high as refinery maintenance in North America and a pullback in buying in January ahead of Chinese New Year has taken
	some steam out of the market. A slowly rising fleet growth this year and lower, yet still robust oil demand growth, is poised to support healthy VLCC earnings in 2015, although earnings are not expected to reach the extraordinary highs of 2015 even
	though the market will still draw upon many of those factors which aided it last year.

	the quarter earlier. The strength continued into Q2-2015 which was almost four times as high as the same quarter in 2014 at nearly $43,000/day &#150; earnings were particularly strong in June as the first signs of record US gasoline consumptions
	began to trickle through, certifying that refineries should keep running at breakneck pace.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Earnings sunk in the third quarter as the summer demand
	tailed off and refineries underwent maintenance, although European refiners for the second year in a row delayed a considerable amount of maintenance compared to the historical average which aided Suezmax tanker demand. After averaging almost
	$35,000/day in Q3-2015, earnings rose as they usually do seasonally to average over $47,500/day in Q4. A fall in prompt supply in West Africa encouraged a rally at the end of November, and the very strong VLCC market during December helped to keep
	supply somewhat tight ex-West Africa as supply moved to capture the spike ex-Mideast Gulf, keeping earnings high at $67,000/day. Overall, the Suezmax composite averaged $43,089/day in 2015 basis our standard assumptions. With the removal of the US
	crude export ban and fall in US production towards the end of the year, there has been renewed crude purchasing from West Africa by the US, bringing the phased out TD5 West Africa/US Atlantic Coast trade somewhat back into play. US refineries will
	look to import crude when the cost of bringing domestic volumes by train is more expensive. If WTI traded at a premium to Brent consistently (as it did immediately following the lifting of the ban) this would bode well for Suezmax demand. So far in
	2016, earnings have averaged less than the 2015 annual average at the time of writing, although the market has picked up from its low at the start of February which is historically a weak month. High refining runs in Europe, and in other regions, a
	low delivery schedule until the end of 2016 and a strong VLCC market translates into healthy expectations for 2016.

	winter months. TD17 Baltic/UK Continent averaged almost $75,000/day in January, while TD7 North Sea/UK Continent rose above $50,000/day during the same month amid a particularly cold winter in northern Europe. Similar to the other crude benchmarks,
	the Aframax composite remained unusually high in Q2-2015 &#150; almost three times the level it was during Q2-2014 &#150; to average over $40,000/day with marked strength in all six routes comprising the benchmark particularly in June, as exhibited
	with the Suezmaxes. Earnings fell in the third quarter to under $30,000/day due to notable weakness in TD11 Cross-Med which fell to under $18,000/day as the tonnage list outweighed cargo activity during the period.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Earnings recovered in the fourth quarter to average almost $39,000/day, near where they started the year as the Mediterranean market recovered but also as the
	weather-sensitive routes picked up despite a mild start to the winter. Overall, the Aframax composite averaged $37,262/day in 2015 as quarterly earnings established at consistently higher levels than in 2014. Despite fleet growth in 2016 for the
	Aframax sector rising only slightly, the sector will be hurt by the supply growth on larger vessels and the newbuild coated Aframax tonnage pushing more (likely older) coated vessels into crude/fuel oil trades instead. Year-on-year earnings will be
	lower in 2016 but will still reach healthy levels given expectations of robust oil demand continuing for at least the first half of this year.

	Earnings in Q4-2015 averaged under $20,000/day as the Mediterranean market toppled from its highs earlier in the season, leading MRs from the region looking
	to ballast north to where the ex-UKC market was still performing relatively well. Overall, the MR Composite averaged $23,697/day in 2015 compared to an annual average in 2014 of $13,954/day. Fleet supply growth is finally tapering off on the MRs.
	Arguably, to an extent in 2015 any jumps in freight were still limited by the heavy fleet supply growth during the year, particularly towards the end of the year. Another summer of high gasoline demand is expected, which should lift the west MR

	American imports almost doubled to reach 3.9&nbsp;million tons for the year. While the Middle East retained its spot as the world&#146;s largest LNG exporter by a closely trailing Australia, imports more than doubled to the region to total
	8.8&nbsp;million tons in 2015. Despite a fall in prices due to the nature of many LNG contracts (linked to the price of Brent), this failed to stifle import demand growth in the trade&#146;s most important demand center, Asia, while a mild winter
	for the second year in a row limited import growth towards the end of the year. Overall, import demand growth in Europe, North America and the Mideast Gulf marginally outweighed declines in Asia and Latin America to register a year-on-year growth of
	0.06% or 1.4&nbsp;million tons to reach a total of 239.7&nbsp;million tons in 2015.

	Global LNG exports rose by over 10% in Australasia to approximately 80&nbsp;million tons with the start-up of BG
	Group&#146;s QCLNG Train 2 in mid-2015 on Australia&#146;s eastern Curtis Island, with the first shipment at the start of July, and a continued growth in exports from ExxonMobil&#146;s LNG project in Papau New Guinea. Middle Eastern LNG exports fell
	year-on-year as the region marked an increase in imports. Yemen&#146;s 6.7&nbsp;million tonne Balhaf plant was shut down early in the year and remains closed due to conflict in the region. Exports from Africa, Europe and the Americas were also down
	slightly year-on-year as project start-ups were delayed.

	Since the start of 2014, LNG prices in the east have more than halved due to their predominant nature of being linked to
	the price of Brent. Whereas LNG prices in the UK and the US, linked instead usually to natural gas hubs, have only fallen marginally in the past two years. In Asia, the lack of demand response from the fall in LNG prices can be linked to the
	re-emergence of nuclear power in the region, a direct competitor to LNG. Japanese prices have fallen to well under $10/mmbtu from just over $20/mmbtu during the start of 2014. The country restarted two Sendai Nuclear units in 2015 and will restart
	another two Takahama nuclear plants in Q1-2016, while a mild start to the winter saw a further fall in price. South Korea started two nuclear units last June and July, the next unit is not expected until April 2016 but an expected build in LNG
	storage by the South Korean electricity provider Kepco will keep LNG demand growing in 2016 despite the nuclear threat.

	LNG supply in 2016 is expected to
	rise by an estimated 10% year-on-year, or 24.5&nbsp;million metric tons, with more than three quarters of the rise coming from the Australasia region as the Yemeni plant is expected to remain offline due to a struggling UN peace process in the
	country. The second 4.5&nbsp;million tons per annum (&#147;mtpa&#148;) train at Conoco Phillip&#146;s Australia Pacific&#146;s LNG facility loaded its first cargoes in January and is expected to start commercial operations by the end of Q1-2016,
	while Chevron&#146;s 15.6 mtpa Gorgon project on Australia&#146;s Barrow Island has started the commissioning process with the first cargo set to be loaded in February or March. In West Africa, the Angola LNG export project was reported to have
	started recommissioning at the end of January, meaning that commercial exports from the plant may start at the end of Q2-2015 while in Nigeria ENI has lifted a force majeure from mid-December on loadings form the 22 mtpa Bonny LNG terminal. Other
	major supply developments are longer term, however there are expectations that investment will now switch to the demand side, meaning regasification facilities in import regions, particularly in South Asia, as opposed to liquefaction projects.

	A total of 420 LNG tankers were on the water as at the end of 2015, a year-on-year gain of 24 vessels and a gain of 60 vessels
	from the start of 2013. The orderbook totals 106 LNG tankers, one vessel lower than at the end of 2014. Freight to Japan trended down throughout 2016, while the arbs from Qatar and the Caribs spent the year under $2/mmbtu after swinging between
	$10/mmbtu and $3/mmbtu between 2011 to mid-2014. LNG tanker earnings east of Suez are down to $29,000/day, a year-on-year fall of 50%, while voyages west of Suez are also down 55% to $29,000/day. One-year term charters as a result are much softer,
	falling to $35,000/day &#150; a year-on-year decline of 38%. Overall, the outlook is limited as scrapping remains low and the orderbook is healthy, but new liquefaction trains coming online this year, which will bring more LNG supply into the
	market, is expected to provide for a modest recovery in freight in 2016.

	Global financial markets and economic conditions have been severely disrupted and volatile in recent years and remain subject to significant

	it is doing so at different rates in different part of the world and concerns over debt levels of certain European Union member states, poor liquidity of European banks and attempts to find appropriate solutions are expected to lead to continued
	slow growth in most of Europe in 2016. There can be no assurance that the global recession will not return and tight credit markets will not continue or become more severe.

	In addition, the continuing sovereign debt crises in various Eurozone countries, including Greece, as well as continued turmoil and

	economy in recent years, there has been some rebound in worldwide demand for oil and oil products, which industry observers forecast will continue. In the event that this rebound falters, the production of and demand for crude oil and petroleum
	products will again encounter pressure which could lead to a decrease in shipments of these products and consequently this would have an adverse impact on the employment of our vessels and the charter rates that they command. However, if the recent
	reduction in oil prices continues in 2016, it may lead to declining output. In particular, the charter rates that we earn from our vessels employed on spot charters, under pool arrangements and contracts of affreightment, and on time-charters with
	profit-share may decline and remain at low levels for a prolonged period of time.

	The tankers owned by our subsidiary companies operate in markets that have historically exhibited seasonal variations in tanker demand, which
	may result in variability in our results of operations on a quarter-by-quarter basis. Tanker markets are typically stronger in the winter months as a result of increased oil consumption in the northern hemisphere, but weaker in the summer months as
	a result of lower oil consumption in the northern hemisphere and refinery maintenance. As a result, revenues generated by the tankers in our fleet have historically been weaker during the fiscal quarters ended June&nbsp;30 and September&nbsp;30.
	However, there may be periods in the northern hemisphere, such as in the winter of 2011/2012, when the expected seasonal strength does not materialize to the extent required to support sustainable profitable rates due to tanker overcapacity.

	Historically, the marine transportation industry has been cyclical. The
	profitability and asset values of companies in the industry have fluctuated based on certain factors, including changes in the supply and demand of vessels. The supply of vessels generally increases with deliveries of new vessels and decreases with
	the scrapping of older vessels and/or the removal of vessels from the competitive fleet either for storage purposes or for utilization in offshore projects. The newbuilding order book equaled approximately 15% of the existing world tanker fleet at
	March 31, 2016, by number of vessels. No assurance can be given that the order book will not increase further in proportion to the existing fleet. If supply increases, and demand does not match that increase, the charter rates for our vessels could
	decline significantly. In addition, any decline of trade on specific long-haul trade routes will effectively increase available capacity with a detrimental impact on rates. A return to weak charter rates could have a material adverse effect on our
	revenues and profitability.

	Under general maritime law in many jurisdictions, crew members, tort claimants, vessel mortgagees,
	suppliers of goods and services and other claimants may lien a vessel for unsatisfied debts, claims or damages. In many jurisdictions a maritime lien holder may enforce its lien by arresting a vessel through court process. In some jurisdictions,
	under the extended sister ship theory of liability, a claimant may arrest not only the vessel with respect to which the claimant&#146;s maritime lien has arisen, but also any associated vessel under common ownership or control. While in some
	jurisdictions which have adopted this doctrine, liability for damages is limited in scope and would only extend to a company and its ship-owning subsidiaries, we cannot assure you that liability for damages caused by some other vessel determined to
	be under common ownership or control with our subsidiaries&#146; vessels would not be asserted against us.

	Our credit facilities, which are secured by mortgages on our subsidiaries&#146;
	vessels, require us to maintain specified collateral coverage ratios and satisfy financial covenants, including requirements based on the market value of our vessels, such as maximum corporate leverage levels.&nbsp;The appraised value of a ship
	fluctuates depending on a variety of factors including the age of the ship, its hull configuration, prevailing charter market conditions, supply and demand balance for ships and new and pending legislation. The oversupply of tankers and depressed
	tanker charter market adversely affected tanker values from the middle of 2008 to late 2013, and despite the young age of our subsidiaries&#146; fleet and extensive long-term charter employment on many of the vessels, resulted in a significant
	decline in the charter-free values of our vessels. Vessel values have recovered since the end of 2013 and may remain at current levels for a prolonged period, decline or rise.&nbsp;We were compliant with all of our loan covenants as at
	December&nbsp;31, 2015. If we are unable to comply with the financial and other covenants under our credit facilities, including by repaying outstanding debt or posting additional collateral in the case of loan-to-asset value covenants, and are
	unable to obtain waivers, our lenders could accelerate our indebtedness. We have paid all of our scheduled loan installments and related loan interest consistently without delay or omission and&nbsp;none of our lenders under our credit facilities
	has requested such prepayment or additional cash collateral. Because of the cross-default provisions in our loan agreements, any such default could in turn lead to additional defaults under our other loan agreements and the consequent acceleration

	four of the vessels owned by our subsidiary companies expire in the remainder of 2016, it may not be possible to re-charter these vessels on a period basis at the attractive rates currently existing. If attractive period charter opportunities are
	not available, we would seek to charter the vessels owned by our subsidiary companies on the spot market, which is subject to significant fluctuations. In the event a vessel owned by one of our subsidiary companies may not find employment at
	economically viable rates, management may opt to lay up the vessel until such time that rates become attractive again (an action which our subsidiary companies have never undertaken). During the period of layup, the vessel will continue to incur
	expenditures such as insurance, reduced crew wages and maintenance costs.

	The spot market for crude oil and petroleum product tankers is highly competitive. As

	time or ballast voyages, leading to a decline in operating revenue. Moreover, to the extent our vessels are employed in the spot market, both our revenue from vessels and our operating costs, specifically our voyage expenses, will be significantly
	impacted by adverse movements in the cost of bunkers (fuel). See &#147;&#151;Fuel prices may adversely affect our profits.&#148; Unlike time charters in which the charterer bears all of the bunker costs, in spot market voyages we bear the bunker
	charges as part of our voyage costs. As a result, while historical movements in bunker charges are factored into the prospective freight rates for spot market voyages periodically announced by World Scale Association (London) Limited and similar
	organizations, increases in bunker charges in any given period could have a material adverse effect on our cash flow and results of operations for the period in which the increase occurs. In addition, to the extent we employ our vessels pursuant to
	contracts of affreightment or under pooling arrangements, the rates that we earn from the charterers under those contracts may be subject to reduction based on market conditions, which could lead to a decline in our operating revenue.

	The global economic downturn that commenced in 2008 resulted in a
	decrease in vessel values. The decrease in value accelerated during 2013 until the latter part of the year as a result of excess fleet capacity and falling freight rates. Although valuations have since recovered, they may rise further, remain the
	same or start to fall again depending on market conditions. In addition, although our subsidiaries currently own a modern fleet, with an average age of 8.6 years as of March&nbsp;31, 2016, as vessels grow older, they generally decline in value.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	In addition, accounting pronouncements require that we periodically review long-lived assets and certain identifiable intangibles for
	impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable. An impairment charge for an asset held for use should be recognized when the estimate of undiscounted cash flows,
	excluding interest charges, expected to be generated by the use of the asset is less than its carrying amount. Measurement of the impairment charge is based on the fair value of the asset as provided by third parties. Such reviews may from time to

	economic disturbances in the countries where the vessels are being built, including any escalation of tensions involving North Korea; weather interference or catastrophic events, such as a major earthquake, tsunami or fire; our requests for changes

	Global financial markets and economic conditions have been disrupted and volatile in recent years. At times, the credit markets as well as the

	We have traditionally
	financed our vessel acquisitions or constructions with our own cash (equity) and bank debt from various reputable national and international commercial banks. In relation to newbuilding contracts, the equity portion usually covers all or part of the
	pre-delivery obligations while the debt portion covers the outstanding amount due to the shipyard on delivery. More recently, however, we have arranged pre-delivery bank financing to cover much of the installments due before delivery, and,
	therefore, we would be required to provide part of our equity at delivery. In addition, several of our existing loans will mature over the next few years, including the current year. In the event that the related vessels are not sold, or we do not
	wish to use existing cash for paying the final balloon payments, then re-financing of the loans for an extended period beyond the maturity date will be necessary. Current and future terms and conditions of available debt financing, especially for
	older vessels without time charter could be different from terms obtained in the past and could result in a higher cost of capital, if available at all. Any adverse development in the credit markets could materially alter our current and future

	Driven in part by an increase in LNG production capacity, the market supply of LNG carriers has been increasing as a result of the
	construction of new ships. According to World Shipyard Monitor Database, during the period from 2005 to 2010, the global fleet of LNG carriers grew by an average of 14%&nbsp;per year due to the construction and delivery of new LNG carriers. From
	2010, contracting accelerated with 53 orders in 2011, 39 in 2013, 63 in 2014, 31 in 2015 by which time the total LNG carrier order book was 142 vessels, representing 34.2% of the total fleet, with the majority of the newbuildings scheduled for
	delivery in 2016 and 2017. This and any future expansion of the global LNG carrier fleet that cannot be absorbed by existing or future LNG projects may have a negative impact on charter rates, ship utilization and ship values. Such impact could be
	amplified if the expansion of LNG production capacity does not keep pace with fleet growth.

	not likely to significantly increase overall risk. Entering into swaps and derivatives transactions is inherently risky and presents various possibilities for incurring significant expenses. The derivatives strategies that we employ in the future

	available to dividends we pay, however, if we qualify as a PFIC for the taxable year of the dividend or the preceding taxable year, or to the extent that (i)&nbsp;the shareholder does not satisfy a holding period requirement that generally requires
	that the shareholder hold the shares on which the dividend is paid for more than 60 days during the 121-day period that begins 60 days before the date on which the shares become ex-dividend with respect to such dividend, (ii)&nbsp;the shareholder is

	Tsakos Energy Navigation Limited
	is a leading provider of international seaborne crude oil and petroleum product transportation services. In 2007, it also started to transport liquefied natural gas. It was incorporated in 1993 as an exempted company under the laws of Bermuda under
	the name Maritime Investment Fund Limited and in, 1996, was renamed MIF Limited. Our common shares were listed in 1993 on the Oslo Stock Exchange (OSE) and the Bermuda Stock Exchange, although we de-listed from the OSE in March 2005 due to limited
	trading. The Company&#146;s shares are no longer actively traded on the Bermuda exchange. In July 2001, the Company&#146;s name was changed to Tsakos Energy Navigation Limited to enhance our brand recognition in the tanker industry, particularly
	among charterers. In March 2002, we completed an initial public offering of our common shares in the United States and our common shares began trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol &#147;TNP.&#148; Since incorporation, the
	Company has owned and operated 81 vessels and has sold 32 vessels (of which three had been chartered back and eventually repurchased at the end of their charters. All three have since been sold again).

	Business Overview
</B>
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	As of April&nbsp;5, 2016 we operated a fleet of 47 modern crude oil and petroleum product tankers that provide world-wide marine transportation
	services for national, major and other independent oil companies and refiners under long, medium and short-term charters. Our fleet also includes one 2007-built LNG carrier and two 2013-built shuttle suezmax tankers with advanced dynamic positioning
	technology (DP2), bringing our total operating fleet to 50 vessels. We have also under construction a 174,000 cbm LNG carrier with expected delivery in the second quarter of 2016, nine crude aframaxes with expected deliveries in 2016 and 2017, two
	LR1 product carriers with expected deliveries in later 2016, two VLCCs with expected deliveries in the second and fourth quarter of 2016 respectively and one shuttle suezmax tanker with expected delivery in 2017. The resulting fleet (assuming no
	further sales or acquisitions) would comprise 65 vessels representing approximately 7.2&nbsp;million dwt.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	We believe that we have
	established a reputation as a safe, high quality, cost efficient operator of modern and well-maintained tankers. We also believe that these attributes, together with our strategy of proactively working towards meeting our customers&#146; chartering
	needs, has contributed to our ability to attract world-class energy producers as customers and to our success in obtaining charter renewals generating strong fleet utilization.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Our fleet is managed by Tsakos Energy Management, a company owned by our chief executive officer. Tsakos Energy Management provides us with
	strategic advisory, financial, accounting and administrative services, while subcontracting the commercial management of our business to Tsakos Shipping. In its capacity as commercial manager, Tsakos Shipping provides various services for our
	vessels, including charterer relations, obtaining insurance and vessel sale and purchase, supervising newbuilding construction and vessel financing. Until June&nbsp;30, 2010, Tsakos Shipping had also provided technical and operational management for
	the majority of our vessels.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Tsakos Energy Management subcontracts the technical and operational management of our fleet to TCM. TCM was
	formed in February 2010 by Tsakos family interests and a German private company, the owner of the ship management company Columbia Shipmanagement Ltd., or CSM, as a joint-venture ship management company on an equal partnership basis to provide
	technical and operational management services to owners of vessels, primarily within the Greece-based market. TCM, which formally commenced operations on July&nbsp;1, 2010, now manages the technical and operational activities of all of our vessels
	apart from the LNG carrier
<I>
	Neo Energy
</I>
	, the VLCC
<I>
	Millennium
</I>
	and the Suezmax tanker
<I>
	Eurochampion 2004,
</I>
	which are technically managed by a non-affiliated ship manager. TCM is based in Athens, Greece. TCM and CSM cooperate in the
	purchase of certain supplies and services on a combined basis. By leveraging the purchasing power of CSM, which currently provides full technical management services for 211 vessels and crewing services for an additional 87 vessels, we believe TCM
	is able to procure services and supplies at lower prices than Tsakos Shipping could alone, thereby reducing overall operating expenses for us. In its capacity as technical manager, TCM manages our day-to-day vessel operations, including provision of
	supplies, maintenance and repair, and crewing. Members of the Tsakos family are involved in the decision-making processes of Tsakos Energy Management, Tsakos Shipping and TCM.

	On October&nbsp;23, 2014 and on November&nbsp;26, 2014 subsidiaries of the Company signed contracts for the construction of two LR1 product carriers and one
	suezmax DP2 shuttle tanker with Sungdong Shipbuilding in South Korea. On December&nbsp;10, 2013, other subsidiaries of the Company signed contracts for the construction of five aframax tankers with Daewoo Shipbuilding in Romania and contracts for
	four additional aframax tankers with the same yard were signed on February&nbsp;26, 2014. In addition, an LNG carrier has been ordered from Hyundai Heavy Industries (see below). The Company acquired the contracts for two VLCC tankers which were
	under construction at the Hyundai Samho Heavy Industries in South Korea. The newbuildings have a double hull design compliant with all classification requirements and prevailing environmental laws and regulations. Tsakos Shipping has worked closely
	with the shipyards in the design of the newbuildings and will continue to work with the shipyards during the construction period. TCM provides supervisory personnel present during the construction. An amount of $4.5 million was paid in 2013 on
	ordering another shuttle tanker from Sungdong. The contract was terminated in 2014 and the deposit credited against the contract price of the LR1 product carriers and new shuttle tanker, leaving, per agreement, $1.65 million to be credited against
	the price of any future construction contracted with Sungdong.

	Under the newbuilding contracts, the purchase prices for the vessels are subject to deductions for delayed delivery, excessive fuel
	consumption and failure to meet specified deadweight tonnage requirements. Progress payments for the newbuildings under construction are equal to between 40% and 55% of the purchase price of each vessel during the period of its construction. As of
	April&nbsp;5, 2016, we have made progress payments of $373.4 million out of the total purchase price of approximately $1,085.3 million (assuming no changes to the vessels to be constructed) for these newbuildings. Of the remaining amount (assuming
	no change to the vessels to be constructed), a further $490.6 million is contracted to be paid during the remaining part 2016.

	Until
	late 2014, we aimed to optimize the financial performance of our fleet by deploying at least two-thirds of our vessels on either time charters or period employment with variable rates, as we took proactive steps to meet any potential impact of the
	expanding world fleet on freight rates. Since the latter part of 2014, we have increased the percentage of the fleet that is in employed at variable rates to approximately 60%, in order to take advantage of the recovery in market rates for vessels
	operating in the crude carrying sector. However, we are prepared to re-employ any number of these vessels on time-charters should hire rates improve. We believe that our fleet deployment strategy and flexibility provides us with the ability to
	benefit from increases in tanker rates while at the same time maintaining a measure of stability through cycles in the industry. The following table details the respective employment basis of our fleet during 2015, 2014 and 2013 as a percentage of
	operating days.

	Tankers operating on time charters may be chartered for several months or years whereas tankers operating in
	the spot market typically are chartered for a single voyage that may last up to several weeks. Vessels on period employment at variable rates related to the market are either in a pool or operating under contract of affreightment for a specific
	charterer. Tankers operating in the spot market may generate increased profit margins during improvements in tanker rates, while tankers operating on time charters generally provide more predictable cash flows. Accordingly, we actively monitor
	macroeconomic trends and governmental rules and regulations that may affect tanker rates in an attempt to optimize the deployment of our fleet. Our fleet has 22 tankers currently operating on spot voyages.

	tanker newbuilding, we have secured a charter for 8 years with charterer&#146;s options for extension for up to three years. The Company is currently discussing employment with potential charterers for the two VLCCs and the LNG carrier, that are

	Pursuant to our management agreement with Tsakos Energy Management, our and our subsidiaries&#146; operations are executed
	and supervised by Tsakos Energy Management, based on the strategy devised by our board of directors and subject to the approval of our board of directors as described below. In accordance with the management agreement, we pay Tsakos Energy
	Management monthly management fees for its management of our vessels. There is a prorated adjustment if at each year end the Euro has appreciated by 10% or more against the Dollar since January&nbsp;1, 2007. In addition, there is an increase each
	year by a percentage figure reflecting 12 month Euribor, if both parties agree. For 2015 and 2014, monthly fees for operating vessels were $27,500 per owned vessel and $20,400&nbsp;for vessels under construction and on bareboat charter. The monthly
	fee for the LNG carrier,
<I>

	help ensure that these fees are competitive with industry standards, our management has periodically made presentations to our board of directors in which the fees paid to Tsakos Energy Management are compared against the publicly available
	financial information of integrated, self-contained tanker companies.

	Tsakos Shipping utilizes the services of various charter brokers to solicit, research, and propose charters for our vessels. The charter
	brokers&#146; role involves researching and negotiating with different charterers and proposing charters to Tsakos Shipping for cargoes to be shipped in our vessels. Tsakos Shipping negotiates the exact terms and conditions of charters, such as
	delivery and re-delivery dates and arranges cargo and country exclusions, bunkers, loading and discharging conditions and demurrage. Tsakos Energy Management is required to obtain our approval for charters in excess of six months and is required to
	obtain the written consent of the administrative agents for the lenders under our secured credit facilities for charters in excess of thirteen months. There are frequently two or more brokers involved in fixing a vessel on a charter. Brokerage fees
	typically amount to 2.5% of the value of the freight revenue or time charter hire derived from the charters. A chartering commission of 1.25% is paid to Tsakos Shipping for every charter involving the vessels in the fleet. In addition, Tsakos
	Shipping may charge a brokerage commission on the sale of a vessel. In 2015, this commission was approximately 0.5% of the sale price of a vessel (0.5% in 2014 and 1% in 2013). The total amount paid for these chartering and acquisition brokerage
	commissions was $7.6 million in 2015, $6.8 million in 2014 and $5.2 million in 2013. Tsakos Shipping may also charge a fee of $200,000 (or such other sum as may be agreed) on delivery of each newbuilding vessel in payment for the cost of design and
	supervision of the newbuilding by Tsakos Shipping. No such fee was paid in 2015. In 2014, such fees amounted to $0.2 million.

	Pursuant to a
	technical management agreement, Tsakos Energy Management employs TCM to manage the day-to-day aspects of vessel operations, including maintenance and repair, provisioning and crewing of the vessels in the fleet. We benefit from the economies of
	scale of having our vessels managed as part of the TCM managed fleet. On occasion, TCM subcontracts the technical management and manning responsibilities of our vessels to third parties. The executive and commercial management of our vessels,
	however, is not subcontracted to third parties. TCM, which is privately held, is one of the largest independent tanker managers with a total of 69 operating vessels under management (including 50 of our subsidiaries&#146; vessels) at March&nbsp;31,
	2016, totaling approximately 6.3&nbsp;million dwt. TCM employs full-time superintendents, technical experts and marine engineers and has expertise in inspecting second-hand vessels for purchase and sale, and in fleet maintenance and repair. They
	have approximately 151 employees engaged in ship management and approximately 2,760 seafaring employees of whom approximately half are employed at sea and the remainder is on leave at any given time. Their principal office is in Athens, Greece. The
	fleet managed by TCM consists mainly of tankers, but also includes feeder container vessels, dry bulk carriers and other vessels owned by affiliates and unaffiliated third parties.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Tsakos Energy Management pays TCM a fee per vessel per month for technical management of operating vessels and vessels under construction.
	This fee was determined by comparison to the rates charged by other major independent vessel managers. We generally pay all monthly operating requirements of our fleet in advance.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">

	Each of the vessels is

	ensure the safe and efficient operation of such vessels and their compliance with applicable regulations. TCM arranges dry-dockings and repairs under instructions and supervision from Tsakos Energy Management. We believe that the continuous
	maintenance program we conduct results in a reduction of the time periods during which our vessels are in dry-dock.

	TCM routinely employs
	on each vessel additional crew members whose primary responsibility is the performance of maintenance while the vessel is in operation. Tsakos Energy Management awards and, directly or through TCM, negotiates contracts with shipyards to conduct such
	maintenance and repair work. They seek competitive tender bids in order to minimize charges to us, subject to the location of our vessels and any time constraints imposed by a vessel&#146;s charter commitments. In addition to dry-dockings, TCM,
	where necessary, utilizes superintendents to conduct periodic physical inspections of our vessels.

	IMO.
</I>
	The International Maritime Organization (&#147;IMO&#148;) has adopted international
	conventions that impose liability for oil pollution in international waters and in a signatory&#146;s territorial waters, including amendments to Annex I of the 1973 International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships
	(&#147;MARPOL&#148;) which set forth new and upgraded requirements for oil pollution prevention for tankers. These regulations are effective in relation to tankers in many of the jurisdictions in which our tanker fleet operates. They provide that
	(1)&nbsp;tankers 25 years old and older must be of double-hull construction and (2)&nbsp;all tankers will be subject to enhanced inspections. All of the vessels in our fleet are of double hull construction. Revised regulations, effective since
	September 2002, provide for increased inspection and verification requirements and for a more aggressive phase-out of single-hull oil tankers, in most cases by 2015 or earlier, depending on the age of the vessel and whether the vessel complies with
	requirements for protectively located segregated ballast tanks. Segregated ballast tanks use ballast water that is completely separate from the cargo oil and oil fuel system. Segregated ballast tanks are currently required by the IMO on crude oil
	tankers of 20,000 tons deadweight or more constructed after 1982. The regulations are intended to reduce the likelihood of oil pollution in international waters. On April&nbsp;5, 2005 an amendment to MARPOL became effective, which accelerated the
	phase out of single-hull tankers from 2015 to 2010 unless the relevant flag state, in a particular case, extended the date to either 2015 or the date on which the ship reaches 25 years of age after the date of its delivery, whichever is earlier.
	This amendment became effective on April&nbsp;5, 2005.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Regulation 12A of MARPOL Annex I came into force on August&nbsp;1, 2007 and governs oil fuel tank protection. The requirements apply to oil
	fuel tanks on all ships with an aggregate capacity of 600 cubic meters and above which are delivered on or after August&nbsp;1, 2010 and all ships for which shipbuilding contracts are placed on or after August&nbsp;1, 2007.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Since January&nbsp;1, 2011 a new chapter 8 of Annex I on the prevention of pollution during transfer of oil cargo between oil tankers at sea
	has applied to oil tankers of 150 gross tons and above. This requires any oil tanker involved in oil cargo ship-to-ship (STS) operations to (1)&nbsp;carry a plan, approved by its flag state administration, prescribing the conduct of STS operations
	and (2)&nbsp;comply with notification requirements. Also with effect from that date, Annex I has been amended to clarify the long standing requirements for on board management of oil residue (sludge) and with effect from August&nbsp;1, 2011, the use
	or carriage of certain heavy oils has been banned in the Antarctic area.

	In September 1997, the IMO adopted Annex VI to MARPOL to address
	air pollution from ships. Annex VI came into force on May&nbsp;19, 2005. It set limits on sulfur oxide and nitrogen oxide emissions from ship exhausts and prohibited deliberate emissions of ozone depleting substances, such as chlorofluorocarbons.
	Annex VI also included a global cap on the sulfur content of fuel oil and allowed for the designation of special areas known as Emission Control Areas (&#147;ECAs&#148;) where more stringent controls on sulfur emissions would apply. Annex VI has
	been ratified by some, but not all IMO member states. All vessels subject to Annex VI and built after May&nbsp;19, 2005 must carry an International Air Pollution Prevention Certificate evidencing compliance with Annex VI. In October 2008, the Marine
	Environment Protection Committee (&#147;MEPC&#148;) of the IMO adopted amendments to Annex VI regarding particulate matter, nitrogen oxide and sulfur oxide emissions standards. These amendments, which entered into force in July 2010, seek to reduce
	air pollution from vessels by establishing a series of progressive standards to further limit the sulfur content in fuel oil, which would be phased in by 2020, and by establishing new tiers of nitrogen oxide emission standards for new marine diesel
	engines, depending on their date of installation. Additionally, more stringent emission standards could apply in ECAs. The United States ratified the amendments in October 2008.

	Amendments to Annex VI to address greenhouse gas emissions from shipping came into force on January&nbsp;1, 2013. New vessels of 400 tons or
	greater are required to meet minimum energy efficiency levels per capacity mile ( the Energy Efficient Design Index (&#147;EEDI&#148;)), while existing vessels were required to implement Ship Energy Efficiency Management Plans (&#147;SEEMPs&#148;).
	All our vessels have SEEMPs. However, the EEDI requirements do not apply to a liquefied natural gas (&#147;LNG&#148;) carrier unless the construction contract for the carrier is placed on or after September&nbsp;1, 2015. The LNG carriers under

	In addition, our &#147;LNG&#148; carrier meets IMO requirements for liquefied gas carriers, as will the LNG carriers under construction. In
	order to operate in the navigable waters of the IMO&#146;s member states, liquefied gas carriers must have an IMO Certificate of Fitness demonstrating compliance with construction codes for liquefied gas carriers. These codes, and similar
	regulations in individual member states, address fire and explosion risks posed by the transport of liquefied gases. Collectively, these standards and regulations impose detailed requirements relating to the design and arrangement of cargo tanks,
	vents, and pipes; construction materials and compatibility; cargo pressure; and temperature control. Liquefied gas carriers are also subject to international conventions that regulate pollution in international waters and a signatory&#146;s
	territorial waters. Under the IMO regulations, gas carriers that comply with the IMO construction certification requirements are deemed to satisfy the requirements of Annex II of MARPOL applicable to transportation of chemicals at sea, which would
	otherwise apply to certain liquefied gases. With effect from January&nbsp;1, 2007, the IMO revised the Annex II regulations that restrict discharges of &#147;noxious liquid substances&#148; during cleaning or de-ballasting operations. The revisions

	Convention&#148;). The United States is not a party to these conventions. Under these conventions, a vessel&#146;s registered owner is strictly liable for pollution damage caused in the territorial waters of a contracting state by discharge of
	persistent oil, subject to certain complete defenses. The liability regime was increased (in limit and scope) in 1992 by the adoption of Protocols to the CLC and Fund Convention which became effective in 1996. The Fund Convention was terminated in
	2002 and the Supplementary Fund Protocol entered into force in March 2005. The liability limit in the countries that have ratified the 1992 CLC Protocol is tied to a unit of account which varies according to a basket of currencies. Under an
	amendment to the Protocol that became effective on November&nbsp;1, 2003, for vessels of 5,000 to 140,000 gross tons, liability is limited to approximately $6.35 million plus approximately $889 for each additional gross ton over 5,000. For vessels
	of over 140,000 gross tons, liability is limited to approximately $126.5 million. As the Convention calculates liability in terms of IMF Special Drawing Rights, these figures are based on currency exchange rates on March31, 2016. From May 1998,
	parties to the 1992 CLC Protocol ceased to be parties to the CLC due to a mechanism established in the 1992 Protocol for compulsory denunciation of the &#147;old&#148; regime; however, the two regimes will co-exist until the 1992 Protocol has been
	ratified by all original parties to the CLC. The right to limit liability is forfeited under the CLC where the spill is caused by the owner&#146;s actual fault and under the 1992 Protocol where the spill is caused by the owner&#146;s intentional or
	reckless conduct. The 1992 Protocol channels more of the liability to the owner by exempting other groups from this exposure. Vessels trading to states that are parties to these conventions must provide evidence of insurance covering the liability
	of the owner. In jurisdictions where the CLC has not been adopted, various legislative schemes or common law govern, and liability is imposed either on the basis of fault or in a manner similar to that convention. We believe that our protection and
	indemnity insurance will cover the liability under the plan adopted by IMO.

	The U.S. National Invasive Species Act (&#147;NISA&#148;) was
	enacted in 1996 in response to growing reports of harmful organisms being released into U.S. ports through ballast water taken on by ships in foreign ports. Under NISA, the U.S. Coast Guard adopted regulations in July 2004 establishing a national
	mandatory ballast water management program for all vessels equipped with ballast water tanks that enter or operate in U.S. waters. These regulations require vessels to maintain a specific ballast water management plan. The requirements can be met by
	performing mid-ocean ballast exchange, by retaining ballast water on board the ship, or by using environmentally sound alternative ballast water management methods approved by the U.S. Coast Guard. However, mid-ocean ballast exchange is mandatory
	for ships heading to the Great Lakes or Hudson Bay, or vessels engaged in the foreign export of Alaskan North Slope crude oil.) Mid-ocean ballast exchange is the primary method for compliance with the Coast Guard regulations, since holding ballast
	water can prevent ships from performing cargo operations upon arrival in the U.S., and alternative methods are still under development. Vessels that are unable to conduct mid-ocean ballast exchange due to voyage or safety concerns may discharge
	minimum amounts of ballast water (in areas other than the Great Lakes and the Hudson River), provided that they comply with record keeping requirements and document the reasons they could not follow the required ballast water management
	requirements. The Coast Guard adopted allowable concentration limits for living organisms in ballast water discharges in U.S. waters, effective June&nbsp;21, 2012. The rules are being phased in, based on the age, ballast water capacity or next
	dry-docking date of a vessel. Although the regulations were to be phased in fully by January&nbsp;1, 2016, the Coast Guard must approve any ballast water management technology before it can be placed on a vessel, and it has yet to do so. The Coast
	Guard has provided waivers to vessels that cannot install the yet to be approved technology.

	collisions with other vessels, damage to other third party property and pollution arising from oil or other substances, including wreck removal. The object of P&amp;I clubs is to provide mutual insurance against liability to third parties incurred

	member&#146;s individual P&amp;I club premium is typically based on the aggregate gross tonnage of the member&#146;s vessels entered into the P&amp;I club according to the risks of insuring the vessels as determined by the P&amp;I club. P&amp;I club
	claims are paid from the aggregate premiums paid by all members, although members remain subject to &#147;calls&#148; for additional funds if the aggregate insurance claims made exceed aggregate member premiums collected. P&amp;I clubs enter into

	World events have an impact on insurance costs and can result in increases in premium; however,
	other significant drivers of premium levels are market over capacity, inadequate deductibles, inefficient claims control by the insurers and scope of cover being too wide. Despite recent expensive years for insurance claims due to a number of global
	catastrophe losses, insurance renewals, and more recently huge maritime losses such as the explosion in the Chinese port of Tianjin and the total loss of the Costa Concordia off the Italian coast and the eventual removal of its wreck, premium
	increases have been benign. The expected modest increase in the cost of Hull&nbsp;&amp; Machinery Insurance renewals for 2015-2016 policy year did not materialize and the softness of the market is likely to continue through the 2016-2017 and
	possibly into the 2017-18 year. The insurance markets maintain their list of World Wide War Risks Exclusions, as defined by the Joint War Committee in the London insurance market, and insurers are at liberty to charge increases in premium in order
	to provide cover for Excluded Areas which include the Indian Ocean, Gulf of Guinea, Libya and Saudi Arabia, amongst others. These additional insurance costs represent a relatively small portion of our total insurance premiums and are, in any case,
	largely paid by the Charterers. Protection&nbsp;&amp; Indemnity (P&amp;I) insurance costs are less affected by world events than H&amp;M and more likely to be driven by maritime losses and whether there is a fall in the value of individual
	Club&#146;s Free Reserves. Recent P&amp;I renewals have seen only a modest increase in rates, at 2.5%. At March&nbsp;31, 2015, the International Group of P&amp;I Clubs continued to provide its members with $1 billion of oil pollution liability
	coverage and more than $4 billion of coverage for other liabilities. P&amp;I, Hull and Machinery and War Risk insurance premiums are accounted for as part of operating expenses in our financial statements; accordingly, any changes in insurance
	premiums directly impact our operating results.

	As of March&nbsp;31, 2016, the fleet consisted of 47 double-hull tankers with an average age of 8.6 years, one LNG carrier and two suezmax DP2
	shuttle tankers providing world-wide marine transportation services for national, major and other independent oil companies and refiners under long, medium and short-term charters. The current operational fleet consists of one VLCC, 15 suezmaxes
	(including two DP2 shuttle tankers), eleven aframaxes, nine panamaxes, six handymaxes, seven handysizes and one LNG carrier. All vessels are owned by our subsidiaries. The charter rates that we obtain for these services are determined in a highly
	competitive global tanker charter market. The tankers operate in markets that have historically exhibited both cyclical and seasonal variations in demand and corresponding fluctuations in charter rates. Tanker markets are typically stronger in the
	winter months as a result of increased oil consumption in the northern hemisphere. In addition, unpredictable weather conditions in the winter months in various regions around the world tend to disrupt vessel scheduling. The oil price volatility
	resulting from these factors has historically led to increased oil trading activities. Changes in available vessel supply are also a contributing factor in affecting the cyclicality and overall volatility present in the tanker sector which is
	reflected both in charter rates and asset values.

	2015 failed to live up to original expectations and turned out to be another year of relatively subdued global GDP growth, especially amongst
	developed nations, and slower growth in world trade, despite further liquidity injections by several central banks, falling oil prices and low inflation. In the second half of the year, China&#146;s slowdown accelerated, highlighted by a reduction
	in imports and exports, as investment decreased and manufacturing activity slackened as the country redirected economic activity towards consumption and services. This led to concern about future prospects for the Chinese economy and the potential
	for the country to import commodities. This in turn generated a ripple negative impact on other economies as reflected by a sharp fall in imports by developing nations. It also severely dampened confidence in the capital markets leading to increased
	volatility. These developments further weakened the world trade environment, already suffering from lower levels of demand and deferred investment, especially in the extractive industries, all of which has harmed most shipping sectors apart from the
	oil carrying sector.

	significant growth, far higher than most other nations, and growth prospects remains high. Japan managed to avoid an expected return to recession and may even be gradually starting to recover
	albeit shakily. The United States and United Kingdom demonstrated respectable, but modest, strengthening, with strong employment numbers, even in the US generating a response from the Federal Reserve to start tightening monetary policy, although
	certain commentators have remarked that this may have been premature. Continental Europe, especially smaller nations such as Ireland, at last began to show signs of a turnaround following a painful period of near stagnation, partly thanks to the
	European version of quantitative easing. Potential clouds on the European horizon are the unresolved situation relating to Russia&#146;s policy towards the Ukraine, which has resulted in trade sanctions and has impacted Russia&#146;s oil exports,
	the possibility of the United Kingdom exiting the European Union, and the growing migrant problem, which also threatens the unity of Europe.

	The dramatic downward slide in oil prices, which started in the latter part of 2014 and accelerated in 2015, as traditional oil exporting
	nations confirmed their intention to continue producing crude oil, provided most oil importing nations with a substantial bonus, but not to the extent that such savings would have expected to generate. This has been put down to the continued
	emphasis of these countries to reduce debt-levels, the benefits of which will be seen later, and possibly to those major oil concerns which have been severely hit by low prices, being reluctant to pass all the reduction to the ultimate consumer. The
	fact that the global energy industry has been hard hit, with the exception of the tanker industry and refiners, and that the previously cash rich oil-exporters have had to cut back on imports of consumer and capital goods may also have dampened
	expectations of benefits.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	For the tanker industry, therefore, the fall in oil prices was a major boon after six years of suppressed
	freight rates, and negative bottom lines. Demand for tankers increased as oil consumption and strategic storage increased, while the number of crude tankers available remained tight, due to limited orders and new, longer trade routes. This resulted
	in a significant increase in rates, starting in the latter part of 2014, and continuing through the whole year, and while rates fluctuated in the course of the year due to refinery maintenance schedules and seasonal factors, depending on tanker
	type, the rates achieved on average were more than enough to generate a long awaited handsome reward to owners, with reduced bunker (fuel) costs contributing to profitability. Product carriers also saw a rebound as demand increased, and new or
	upgraded refineries opened up to enjoy impressive margins. These refineries opened in new locations in the Middle East, India and China, while refineries closer to the main centers of consumption continued to close. However, a significant addition
	of vessels to the global fleet as a result of over-ordering muted the potentially strong impact on product carrier rates. Vessel values also remained strong during this period, although not increasing to the levels expected, given the sustained
	levels of freight rates which are expected to remain throughout 2016 and into 2017.

	The fleet achieved voyage revenues of $587.7 million

	Considerable economic and political uncertainty remains in the world as we enter the second quarter of 2016. The positive signs in terms of
	declining unemployment, strengthening dollar, low inflation, respectable growth and returning consumer confidence, continue to emanate from the United States. Certain recent measures have been taken in Europe to regenerate growth with a
	determination not to allow member states to fail or exit the Eurozone. Many developing countries still have surging economies albeit with the occasional readjustments or corrections. The fall in oil prices, although hurting a number of countries
	highly dependent on oil exports, allows most other nations to reduce their expenditure on oil imports and utilize their funds on consumer or development expenditures instead. Certain issues are cause for concern, including an increased level of
	violence in the Middle East, the increased tension in West-Russia relations due to the Ukraine situation and the potential for disunity in the European Union due to uncontrolled immigration and the possible exit of the United Kingdom.

	We believe that oil prices are likely to remain subdued through much of 2016 with a possibility of approaching $50 to $60 per bbl and,
	therefore, demand will continue buoyant during the year. As there is no real likelihood of substantial numbers of new crude carriers entering the market, we see 2016 as a year of strong charter rates with seasonal fluctuations, but possibly without
	the extreme dips and spikes in rates for crude tankers as we experienced in 2015. Indeed, we feel that a healthy sustainability in rates may last through 2016 and into 2017 at which stage new vessels may begin to play an adverse role in the crude
	market. On the product trade our previous optimism, which was diluted by excessive ordering of new product carriers, is returning, as new refineries are in operation and generating new and longer trade routes for product carriers, which have
	contributed to a return of rates above break-even level. LNG carrier rates have dipped and are likely to remain at levels which provide only modest returns due to delays in the completion of LNG projects and a growing supply

</B>
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	We typically charter
	our subsidiaries&#146; vessels to third parties in any of five basic types of charter. First are &#147;voyage charters&#148; or &#147;spot voyages,&#148; under which a shipowner is paid freight on the basis of moving cargo from a loading port to a
	discharging port at a given rate per ton or other unit of cargo. Port charges, bunkers and other voyage expenses (in addition to normal vessel operating expenses) are the responsibility of the shipowner.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Second are &#147;time charters,&#148; under which a shipowner is paid hire on a per day basis for a given period of time. Normal vessel
	operating expenses, such as stores, spares, repair and maintenance, crew wages and insurance premiums, are incurred by the shipowner, while voyage expenses, including bunkers and port charges, are the responsibility of the charterer. The time
	charterer decides the destination and types of cargoes to be transported, subject to the terms of the charter. Time charters can be for periods of time ranging from one or two months to more than three years. The agreed hire may be for a fixed daily
	rate throughout the period or may be at a guaranteed minimum fixed daily rate plus a share of a determined daily rate above the minimum, based on a given variable charter index or on a decision by an independent brokers&#146; panel for a defined
	period. Many of our charters have been renewed on this time charter with profit share basis over the past three years. Time charters can also be &#147;evergreen,&#148; which means that they automatically renew for successive terms unless the
	shipowner or the charterer gives notice to the other party to terminate the charter.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Third are &#147;bareboat charters&#148; under which
	the shipowner is paid a fixed amount of hire for a given period of time. The charterer is responsible for substantially all the costs of operating the vessel including voyage expenses, vessel operating expenses, dry-docking costs and technical and
	commercial management. Longer-term time charters and bareboat charters are sometimes known as &#147;period charters.&#148;
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Fourth are
	&#147;contracts of affreightment&#148; which are contracts for multiple employments that provide for periodic market related adjustments, sometimes within prescribed ranges, to the charter rates.

	Fifth are &#147;pools&#148;. During 2015, one of our subsidiaries&#146; vessel also operated within a pool of similar vessels for part of the
	year whereby all income (less voyage expenses) is earned on a market basis and shared between pool participants on the basis of a formula which takes into account the vessel&#146;s age, size and technical features.

	Our chartering strategy continues to be one of fixing the greater portion of our fleet on medium to long-term employment in order to secure a
	stable income flow, but one which also ensures a satisfactory return. This strategy has enabled us to smooth the effects of the cyclical nature of the tanker industry, achieving almost optimal utilization of the fleet. In order to capitalize on
	possible upturns in rates, we have chartered out several of our vessels on a basis related to market rates for either spot or time charter with an emphasis on spot charters in 2015.

	Our Board of Directors, through its Chartering Committee, formulates our chartering strategy and our commercial manager Tsakos Energy

	Our vessels are employed under a variety of charter contracts, including time,

	contract of affreightment are recognized ratably from when a vessel becomes available for loading (discharge of the previous charterer&#146;s cargo) to when the next charterer&#146;s cargo is discharged, provided an agreed non-cancelable charter
	between the Company and the charterer is in existence, the charter rate is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured. Vessel voyage and operating expenses and charter hire expense are expensed when incurred. The operating
	revenues and voyage expenses of vessels operating under a tanker pool are pooled and are allocated to the pool participants on a time charter equivalent basis, according to an agreed formula. Revenues from variable hire arrangements are recognized
	to the extent the variable amounts earned beyond an agreed fixed minimum hire at the reporting date and all other revenue recognition criteria are met.

	Depreciation.
</I>
</B>
	We depreciate our vessels on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives, after considering their
	estimated residual values, based on the assumed value of the scrap steel available for recycling after demolition, calculated at $300 per lightweight ton since January&nbsp;1, 2008. Since steel prices were at consistently higher levels during the
	last few years and were expected to remain at high levels for the following years, from October&nbsp;1, 2012, scrap values are calculated at $390 per lightweight ton (lwt). Our estimate was based on the average demolition prices prevailing in the
	market during the last ten years for which historical data were available. From mid-2015, scrap values have fallen from $390 per lwt and are now at approximately $250 per lwt. Given the historical volatility of scrap prices, management will monitor
	prices going forward and where a distinctive trend is observed over a given length of time, management may consider revising the scrap price accordingly. In assessing the useful lives of vessels, we have adopted the industry-wide accepted practice
	of assuming a vessel has a useful life of 25 years (40 years for the LNG carrier), given that all classification society rules have been adhered to concerning survey certification and statutory regulations are followed.

	estimate of future undiscounted net operating cash flows expected to be generated by the use of the vessel over its remaining useful life and its eventual disposition to its carrying amount. The
	average age of our vessels is approximately 8.5 years. The average remaining operational life is, therefore, 16.5 years. Given the extensive remaining lives, we do not believe that there is a significant risk of not generating future undiscounted
	net operating cash flows in excess of carrying values. However, as indicated above, circumstances may change at any time which would oblige us to reconsider the extent of risk of impairment.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Future undiscounted net operating cash flows are determined by applying various assumptions regarding future revenues net of commissions,
	operating expenses, scheduled dry-dockings and expected off-hire and scrap values. Our projections for charter revenues are based on existing charter agreements for the fixed fleet days and an estimated daily average hire rate per vessel category
	for the unfixed days based on the most recent ten year historical averages publicly provided by major brokers, which, given the wide spread of annual rates between the peaks and troughs over the decade, we believe provides as fair as any other
	assumption that could be used in determining a rate for a long-term forecast. In addition, we apply a 2% annual escalation in rates to take account of published long-term growth and inflation expectations in the developed world. Exclusion of such an
	escalation would not impact the overall impairment conclusion for each vessel for the years 2015, 2014 and 2013. Future operating costs are based on the 2015 average per individual vessel to which we also apply a 2% annual escalation. Residual or
	scrap value is based on the same scrap price used for depreciation purposes as described above. All such estimations are inevitably subjective. Actual freight rates, industry costs and scrap prices may be volatile. As a consequence, estimations may
	differ considerably from actual results.

	Where a vessel is deemed to be a risk, we also take into account the age, condition,
	specifications, marketability and likely trading pattern of each such vessel, and apply various possible scenarios for employment of the vessel during its remaining life. We prepare cash flows for each scenario and apply a percentage possibility to
	each scenario to calculate a weighted average expected cash flow for the vessel for assessing whether an impairment charge is required. The estimations also take into account regulations regarding the permissible trading of tankers depending on
	their structure and age.

	While management, therefore, is of the opinion that the assumptions it has used in assessing whether there are
	grounds for impairment are justifiable and reasonable, the possibility remains that conditions in future periods may vary significantly from current assumptions, which may result in a material impairment loss. If the current economic recovery stalls
	or if oil prices begin to trend upwards again, oil demand over an extended period of time could be negatively impacted. This will exacerbate the consequences of overcapacity in the tanker sector. In such circumstances, the possibility will increase
	that both the market value of the older vessels of our fleet and the future cash flow they are likely to earn over their remaining lives will be less than their carrying value and an impairment loss will occur.

	Should the carrying value of the vessel exceed its estimated undiscounted cash flows, impairment is measured based on the excess of the
	carrying amount over the fair value of the asset. The fair values are determined based principally from or by corroborated observable market data. Inputs considered by management in determining the fair value include independent brokers&#146;
	valuations. As vessel values are also volatile, the actual market value of a vessel may differ significantly from estimated values within a short period of time.

	In accordance with Classification Society requirements, a special survey is

	2013, for vessels reaching ten years in age, we estimated that the next dry-docking would be due after two and a half years. However, according to Classification Society regulations, vessels can defer the next dry-docking for five years during their
	first fifteen years of life, instead of ten years as previously estimated. We calculate that this change in estimate did not have a material effect in the years ending December&nbsp;31, 2014 and December&nbsp;31, 2015 and thereafter. During a
	dry-docking, work is undertaken to bring the vessel up to the condition required for the vessel to be given its classification certificate. The costs include the yard charges for labor, materials and services, possible new equipment and parts where
	required, plus part of the participating crew costs incurred during the survey period. We defer these charges and amortize them over the period up to the vessel&#146;s next scheduled dry-docking.

	Management reviews the fair values of financial assets and liabilities included in the
	balance sheet on a quarterly basis as part of the process of preparing financial statements. The carrying amounts of financial assets and accounts payable are considered to approximate their respective fair values due to the short maturity of these
	instruments. The fair values of long-term bank loans with variable interest rates approximate the recorded values, generally due to their variable interest rates. The present value of the future cash flows of the portion of any long-term bank loan
	with a fixed interest rate is estimated and compared to its carrying amount. The fair value of the investments equates to the amounts that would be received by the Company in the event of sale of those investments, and any shortfall from carrying
	value is treated as an impairment of the value of that investment. The fair value of the interest rate swap, bunker swap agreements, and bunker call options held by the Company are determined through Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy as defined in
	FASB guidance and are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data, interest rates, yield curves and other items that allow value to be determined. The fair values of impaired vessels are determined by management through Level
	2 of the fair value hierarchy based on available market data and taking into consideration third party valuations.

	Voyage revenues.
</I>
	Revenues are generated from freight billings and time charters. Time and bareboat charter revenues
	are recorded over the term of the charter as the service is provided. Revenues from voyage charters on the spot market or under contract of affreightment are recognized ratably from when a vessel becomes available for loading (discharge of the
	previous charterer&#146;s cargo) to when the next charterer&#146;s cargo is discharged, provided an agreed non-cancelable charter between the Company and the charterer is in existence, the charter rate is fixed or determinable and collectability is
	reasonably assured. The operating revenues of vessels operating under a tanker pool are pooled and are allocated to the pool participants on a time charter equivalent basis according to an agreed upon formula. Revenues from variable hire
	arrangements are recognized to the extent the variable amounts earned beyond an agreed fixed minimum hire at the reporting date and all other revenue recognition criteria are met. Unearned revenue represents cash received prior to the year end and
	is related to revenue applicable to periods after December&nbsp;31 of each year.

	Time Charter Equivalent (&#147;TCE&#148;) allows vessel

	We pay commissions on all chartering arrangements to Tsakos Shipping, as our broker, and to any other broker we employ.
	Each of these commissions generally amounts to 1.25% of the daily charter hire or lump sum amount payable under the charter. In addition, on some trade routes, certain charterers may include in the charter agreement an address commission which is a
	payment due to the charterer, usually ranging from 1.25% to 3.75% of the daily charter hire or freight payable under the relevant charter. These commissions, as well as changes in prevailing charter rates, will cause our commission expenses to

	Impairment loss.

	An impairment loss for an asset held for use should
	be recognized when indicators of impairment exist and when the estimate of undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the use of the asset is less than its carrying amount (the vessel&#146;s net book value plus any unamortized deferred
	dry-docking charges). Measurement of the impairment loss is based on the fair value of the asset as determined by reference to available market data and considering valuations provided by third parties. An impairment loss for an asset held for sale
	is recognized when its fair value less cost to sell is lower than its carrying value at the date it meets the held for sale criteria. In this respect, management reviews regularly the carrying amount of the vessels in connection with the estimated
	recoverable amount for each of the Company&#146;s vessels. As a result of such reviews, it was determined that no impairment charge was required in 2015 or 2014, while in 2013 and 2012 an impairment loss had been incurred with respect to the
	carrying values of four of the older vessels of the fleet in 2013 and the oldest vessel of the fleet in 2012.

	Insurance claim proceeds.
</I>
	In the event of an incident involving one of our
	vessels, where the repair costs or loss of hire is insurable, we immediately initiate an insurance claim and account for such claim when it is determined that recovery of such costs or loss of hire is probable and collectability is reasonably
	assured within the terms of the relevant policy. Depending on the complexity of the claim, we would generally expect to receive the proceeds from claims within a twelve month period. During the 2015-16 policy year, we will have received
	approximately $0.6 million in net proceeds from hull and machinery and loss of hire claims arising from incidents where damage was incurred by one of our vessels. Such settlements were generally received as credit-notes from our insurer, Argosy
	Insurance Company Limited, and set off against insurance premiums due to that company. Therefore, within the consolidated statements of cash flows, these proceeds are included in decreases in receivables and in decreases in accounts payable. There
	is no material impact on reported earnings arising from these settlements.

	Market conditions for tankers further improved in 2015, as a result
	of the falling oil price and limited vessel supply growth especially for the crude tanker fleet. The surplus in crude oil production translated directly into higher volumes shipped around the world as refinery margins soared, demand spiked at lower
	prices, refinery maintenance was postponed and plants ran at historically high utilization rates across the board. The lower oil prices spurred large scale stock building (commercial, refinery level and strategic). Major crude buyers and traders

	spread out the global fleet. The higher refinery utilization rates and margins also contributed to an increase in rates for product carriers. The Company had more vessel days employed on spot and
	period employment with variable rates in 2015 compared to 2014, enabling the fleet to take advantage of the improved freight rates. The average time charter equivalent rate per vessel achieved for the year 2015 was higher by 30.8% at $25,940 per day
	compared to $19,834 per day for the previous year. The increase is mainly due to improvement in the freight rates as a result of decreasing oil prices and the resulting increase in oil demand, a more balanced supply of vessels due to limited
	ordering of new crude carriers in the preceding years, and seasonal winter factors in the beginning and end of the year. Our aframax tankers, which were trading mostly on spot charters during the year, had the highest increase in their time charter
	equivalent rate by 47% over the preceding year. Our suezmax tankers, which were trading mostly on spot and on time charters with profit sharing arrangements earned a time charter equivalent rate higher by 44% over the prior year. The Company&#146;s
	lone VLCC also took advantage of the spiking market capturing the prevailing high time charter rates resulting in a 127% increase of its TCE for the year over 2014.

	TCE is calculated by taking voyage revenue less voyage expenses divided by the number of operating days. As from the first

	Time charter equivalent revenue and TCE rate are not measures of financial performance under U.S. GAAP and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures

	Voyage expenses include port charges, agents&#146; fees, canal dues and bunker (fuel) costs relating to spot charters or
	contract of affreightment. These voyage expenses are borne by the Company unless the vessel is on time-charter or operating in a pool, in which case they are borne by the charterer or by the pool operators. As from the first quarter of 2015,
	commissions on revenue are included in voyage expenses, in order to be consistent with and comparable to other reporting entities within the peer group of tanker companies. They are borne by the Company for all types of charter. Voyage expenses were
	$131.8 million during 2015 compared to $154.1&nbsp;million during the prior year, a 14.5% decrease. The total operating days on spot charters and contracts of affreightment totaled 7,781 days in 2015 compared to 6,571 days in 2014. Voyage expenses
	are highly dependent on the voyage patterns followed and size of vessels employed on spot charter or contract of affreightment. In 2015, the decrease in voyage expenses was primarily due to a 30.5% decrease in the bunkering expenses due to fall in
	the bunker prices by 45.5%, which is off-set by an increase of 38.5% in the volume of bunker purchases, as a result of the increased days the vessels were operating in types of employment bearing voyage expenses. Also, during 2015, the increase in
	the number of days the vessels operated on spot and COA employment bearing voyage expenses resulted in an increase in port expenses. However, on a per relevant vessel basis their average daily cost decreased by 10.6%.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Commissions in 2015 totaled $22.7 million compared to $18.8 million in 2014, a 20.7% increase. Commissions were 3.9% of revenue from vessels in 2015 compared
	to 3.8% in 2014. The increase in total commission charges relates mainly to the increase in revenue and partly to the increase in the number of days our vessels participated in spot voyages in 2015 compared to 2014.

	Vessel operating expenses include crew costs, insurances, repairs and maintenance, spares, stores, lubricants,
	quality and safety costs and other expenses such as tonnage tax, registration fees and communication costs. As from January&nbsp;1, 2015, foreign currency gains or losses, previously shown as a separate line item in the consolidated statement of
	comprehensive income / (loss), are included in the operating expenses line item in order to be consistent with and comparable to other reporting entities within the peer group of tanker companies. Total operating costs were $142.1 million during
	2015, compared to $146.9 million during 2014, a decrease of 3.3%, primarily due to the appreciation of the US dollar against the Euro and the disposal of the 2002-built suezmax tanker
<I>
	Triathlon
</I>
	and the 2004-built handysize product carrier
<I>

	The exchange rate of the U.S. dollar against the Euro saw a 16.4% strengthening of the dollar between 2015 and 2014. The fluctuations in the U.S. dollar/Euro
	exchange rate mainly impact crew costs, as most of the Company&#146;s crew expenses, relating mainly to Greek vessel officers, are paid in Euro. As a result, crew costs decreased by 7.1%. The dry-docking activity in every year affects repairs and
	maintenance expenses as certain works performed during dry-dockings that do not qualify for capitalization are expensed. In 2015, nine dry-dockings were performed compared to eight dry-dockings in 2014. Apart from the repairs performed during
	dry-dockings, many repairs which included the replacement with expensive spare parts were performed in a number of vessels during 2015 increasing the overall cost. All other categories of operating expenses remained approximately at the same levels
	in 2015.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Average operating expenses per ship per day for the fleet decreased to $7,933 for 2015 from $8,209 in 2014. This was partly due to the decrease
	in overall operating costs described above and to the disposal of older vessels which due to their age bear higher daily operating costs which impact the average daily operating costs per vessel of the fleet.

	comparable figures have been amended accordingly. Depreciation and amortization charges totaled $105.9 million in 2015 compared to $102.9 million in 2014, a 3.0% increase.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Depreciation amounted to $99.6 million in 2015 compared to $97.9 million during 2014, an increase of $1.7&nbsp;million, or 1.7%. The increase is due to

<I>
	Euro
</I>
	in June and July 2014 respectively and the suezmax tanker

	We amortize the cost of dry-dockings related to classification society surveys

	$5.0 million in 2014, an increase of 26.0%. In 2015, nine vessels undertook dry-docking compared to eight vessels in 2014. In addition, the immediate write-off of $0.9 million deferred charges relating to the product carrier

	Management fees, including those paid to third-party managers, totaled $16.6 million during 2015, compared to

	The Company pays to Tsakos Energy Management fixed fees per vessel under a management agreement. The fee includes compensation for services that cover
	both the management of the individual vessels and of the enterprise as a whole. According to the management agreement, there is a prorated adjustment if at the beginning of the year the Euro has appreciated by 10% or more against the
	U.S.&nbsp;Dollar since January&nbsp;1, 2007, and an increase each year by a percentage figure reflecting 12 month Euribor, if both parties agree. There was no increase in management fees payable to the management company in 2014 and 2015. In 2015,

<I>
	Neo Energy,

<I>
	Millennium
</I>
	and the suezmax
<I>

	operating conventional vessels are $27,500 per month, since January&nbsp;1, 2012. The monthly fee relating to vessels chartered-in or chartered-out on a bare-boat basis or for vessels under construction is $20,400. Management fees for
<I>
	Neo
	Energy
</I>
	are $35,833, of which $10,000 are payable to the management company and $25,833 to the third-party manager. Management fees for the DP2 suezmax shuttle tankers are $35,000 per month. Management fees for
<I>
	Millennium
</I>
	were $27,500 per
	month, of which $13,940 were payable to a third-party manager until November&nbsp;5, 2015 when the vessel entered a bare-boat charter. Management fees for
<I>
	Eurochampion 2004
</I>
	are $27,500 per month, of which $12,000 are payable to a third party

	expenses consist primarily of professional fees, investor relations, office supplies, advertising costs, directors&#146; liability insurance, directors&#146; fees and reimbursement of our directors&#146; and officers&#146; travel-related expenses.
	General and administrative expenses in 2015 totaled $4.1 million compared to $4.4 million in 2014, a 6.8% reduction mainly due to reduced listing fees.

	increase being mainly due to the management incentive award approved in May 2015 (none in 2014).

	Revenue from vessels amounted to $501.0 million during the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2014 compared to $418.4 million during
	the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2013, a 19.8% increase. There was an average of 49.0 vessels operating in 2014 compared to an average of 47.5 vessels in 2013, the increase relating to the acquisition of the suezmaxes
<I>
	Eurovision
</I>
	and
<I>
	Euro
</I>
	in mid-2014. Based on the total days that the vessels were actually employed as a percentage of the days that we owned the vessels, the fleet enjoyed 97.7% employment compared to 97.8% in the previous year, the lost time being mainly due
	to the eight dry-dockings performed during the year, while in 2013 there were seven dry-dockings.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Market conditions for tankers improved considerably in
	2014, especially in the latter part of the year, due to restricted availability of vessels and falling oil prices, which significantly and positively impacted the crude carrying sector especially, but also contributed to an increase in rates for
	product carriers. Traders and consuming countries, either speculatively or strategically, stockpiled crude oil in onshore storage facilities or offshore in tankers, removing from the spot trade over twenty VLCCs which were used as floating storage,
	thereby increasing the demand for remaining crude carriers. The Company had more vessel days employed on spot and period employment with variable rates in 2014 compared to 2013, enabling the fleet to take advantage of the improved freight rates. The
	average time charter equivalent rate per vessel achieved for the year 2014 was higher by 17.0% at $19,834 per day compared to $16,957 per day for the previous year. The increase is mainly due to improvement in the freight rates as a result of
	decreasing oil prices and the resulting increase in oil demand, a more balanced supply of vessels due to limited ordering of new crude carriers in the preceding years, and seasonal winter factors in the beginning and end of the year. Our aframax
	tankers, which were trading mostly on spot charters during the year, had the highest increase in their time charter equivalent rate by 55% over the preceding year. Our suezmax tankers, which were trading mostly on spot and on time charter with
	profit sharing arrangements earned a time charter equivalent higher by 23% over the prior year. The introduction of the two suezmax DP2 shuttle tankers in mid-2013, which operated for a full year in 2014, and the addition of the suezmaxes
<I>
	Eurovision
</I>
	and
<I>
	Euro
</I>
	in 2014 positively affected our gross revenue.

	Voyage expenses include port charges, agents&#146; fees, canal dues and bunker (fuel) costs relating to spot charters or
	contract of affreightment. Voyage expenses were $154.1 million during 2014 compared to $133&nbsp;million during the prior year, a 15.9% increase. The total operating days on spot charters and contracts of affreightment totaled 6,571 days in 2014
	compared to 5,675 days in 2013. Voyage expenses are highly dependent on the voyage patterns followed and size of vessels employed on spot charter or contract of affreightment. In 2014, the increase in voyage expenses was primarily due to a 15.8%
	increase in the days the vessels operated on spot and COA employment bearing voyage expenses, resulting in an increase of 21.4% in the volume of bunkers consumed, this was offset among other factors, by a 10.1% decrease in bunker prices paid between
	the two years. Also, during 2014, several vessels were chartered for long-haul voyages on routes which have developed significantly with the recent inaugurations of new refineries in the Middle East and elsewhere in Asia. The increase in the number
	of days the vessels operated on spot and COA employment bearing voyage expenses also resulted in an increase in port expenses. However, port and other expenses vary between different ports, so overall voyage expenses were also affected by which
	ports the vessels visited.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Commissions during 2014 amounted to $18.8 million compared to $16.0 million in 2013, a 17.5% increase. Commissions were 3.8%
	of revenue from vessels in both 2014 and 2013. The increase in total commission charges relates in part to the increased average number of vessels by 1.5 vessels in 2014 compared to 2013, and to additional vessels trading on spot voyages.

	Vessel operating expenses include crew costs, insurances, repairs and maintenance, spares, stores, lubricants,
	quality and safety costs and other expenses such as tonnage tax, registration fees and communication costs. Total operating costs were $146.9 million during 2014, compared to $131.1 million during 2013, an increase of 12.1%, primarily due to the
	addition of the two suezmaxes
<I>
	Eurovision
</I>
	and
<I>
	Euro
</I>
	in June and July 2014 respectively, the operation of the two shuttle tankers

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Crew costs increased as a result of the increase in the
	average number of vessels during the year and increased crew income taxes. The dry-docking activity in every year affects repairs and maintenance expenses as certain works performed during dry-dockings that do not qualify for capitalization are
	expensed. In 2014, eight dry-dockings were performed compared to seven dry-dockings in 2013. Apart from the repairs performed during dry-dockings, many repairs which included the replacement with expensive spare parts were performed in a number of
	vessels during 2014 increasing the overall cost. In addition, the timing of the ordering of stores and spare parts had a negative effect on our operating expenses. Lubricants have increased due to the higher number of vessels in the year as well as
	the type of vessels. The drop in oil prices in the latter part of the year had not been reflected in the prices of lubricants contracted at an earlier date. Insurances increased by $1.2 million, mainly due to increases in insurance premiums and
	extra vessels. The expenses included under the category other were higher by 28.0% in 2014 compared to 2013 mainly due to increased vessel tonnage taxes, resulting from new Greek legislation. As a percentage of voyage revenues, vessel operating
	expenses were 29.3% in 2014 compared to 31.3% in 2013.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Average operating expenses per ship per day for the fleet increased to $8,209 for 2014 from $7,651
	in 2013. This was partly due to the increase in overall operating costs described above and to the addition of vessels which due to their size and complexity bear higher daily operating costs which impact the average daily operating costs per vessel
	of the fleet. Approximately 46% of operating expenses (27% of total costs) incurred are in Euro, mainly relating to vessel officers. The average exchange rate of the US dollar against the Euro remained unchanged between 2014 and 2013 and had minimal
	effect on our operating expenses. However, the US dollar strengthened significantly towards the end of 2014 and in the beginning of 2015, which if it continues throughout 2015, will have a positive impact on our operating expenses for 2015 (a 20%
	strengthening of the US dollar against the Euro would have a positive effect on our operating expenses of approximately $12.3 million in 2014). The creation of TCM in 2010, between Tsakos Shipping and Columbia Shipmanagement Ltd., resulted in
	increased purchasing power based on the combined fleets managed by TCM and Columbia. This provided considerable savings in the purchase of stores, spares and lubricants both in 2014 and 2013.

	Depreciation was $97.9 million during 2014 compared to $95.3 million during 2013, an increase of $2.6&nbsp;million, or 2.7%. The increase is due to addition of

	We amortize the cost of dry-dockings related to classification society surveys over the period to the next dry-docking, and this
	amortization is included as part of the normal costs we incur in connection with the operation of our vessels. During 2014, amortization of deferred dry-docking costs was $5.0 million compared to $5.1 million during 2013, a decrease of 2.2%. In
	2014, eight vessels performed dry-docking compared to seven vessels in 2013. The increase in amortization was due to increased deferred charges, offset by a change in estimation in calculating amortization, as described above.

	Interest and finance costs, net, were $43.1 million for 2014 compared to $40.9 million for 2013, a 5.4% increase. Loan
	interest, excluding payment of swap interest, decreased to $31.4 million from $35.8 million, a 12.3% decrease mainly due to the decrease in margins as a result of the expiry of the waivers in mid-2014 and the return to compliance with loan
	covenants. In addition, total weighted average bank loans outstanding were approximately $1,388 million for 2014 compared to $1,422 million for 2013. Cash settlements on both hedging and non-hedging interest rate swaps, based on the difference
	between fixed payments and variable 6-month LIBOR, decreased to $5.2 million from $11.4 million, as one swap expired in 2014 and two swaps expired in 2013. The average loan financing cost in 2014, including the impact of all interest rate swap cash
	settlements, was 2.6% compared to 3.2%, for 2013. Capitalized interest, which is based on expenditures incurred to date on vessels under construction, was $2.4&nbsp;million in 2014, compared to $1.9 million in 2013, the increase being due to the

	compared to $0.1 million gains in 2013, such losses being a result of the unexpected sharp fall in oil prices in the latter part of 2014. As the hedges expire during 2015, no further losses are expected to be recorded in 2015. In 2014, the Company
	entered into three put options relating to bunker costs, primarily to cap further valuation losses, which do not qualify for hedging. The premium paid for the acquisition of those options was $1.2 million and the unrealized mark-to market valuation

	Our liquidity requirements relate to servicing our debt, funding the equity portion of investments in vessels, funding working capital and controlling

	Current assets increased to $452.2

	offering in April 2015 under which the Company raised $81.8 million net of underwriter&#146;s discount and other expenses. Restricted cash balances increased by $3.0 million mainly due to the deposit of $6.4 million in a restricted account in
	respect of the deposit for the purchase of the
<I>
	Decathlon

	in February 2016, offset by the release of $2.7 million on the expiry of the margin call relating to the bunker hedging swaps. Accounts receivable increased to $45.5 million from $42.0

	which was non-compliant, was reclassified to short term liabilities. Payables increased by just $0.2 million. The current portion of financial instruments amounted to $5.7 million and $15.4 million, respectively, at December&nbsp;31, 2015 and 2014.

	carriers with total remaining payments of $805.7 million, all of which we expect to be covered by new debt or additional sources of capital, as described above. Until April&nbsp;5, 2016, the Company has agreed secured term bank loans, or obtained
	firm bank commitments for loans, for all the newbuildings under construction. In addition, a portion of $4.5 million in yard installments paid for a previous shuttle tanker project and subsequently cancelled has been used against the contract price
	of the two LR1 panamax tankers ($1.2 million) and against the contract price of the new shuttle tanker ($1.65 million). The remaining $1.65 million will be used against the contract price of any other vessel the Company may order from the yard in
	the future. The LNG carrier is expected to be delivered in the second quarter of 2016, the aframaxes are expected to be delivered at various dates between the second quarter of 2016 and the third quarter of 2017 and the LR1 tankers are expected to
	be delivered in the third quarter of 2016 and the two VLCCs in the second and fourth quarter of 2016.

	We operate in a capital-intensive industry requiring extensive investment in revenue-producing assets. As discussed previously in the section
	&#147;Our Fleet,&#148; we continue to have an active fleet development program resulting in a fleet of modern and young vessels with an average age of 8.6 years at March&nbsp;31, 2016. We raise the funds for such investments in newbuildings mainly
	from borrowings and partly out of internally generated funds and equity issuance transactions. Newbuilding contracts generally provide for multiple staged payments of 10%, with the balance of the vessel purchase price paid upon delivery. In the case
	of the nine aframaxes, the two LR1 suezmax tankers, one shuttle tanker under construction, pre and post delivery financing has been arranged for part of the installment payments to the shipbuilding yard and for the last installment to the yard on
	delivery of the vessels. Also, we have received bank commitments for the delivery yard installments for the LNG carrier and the pre-delivery and post-delivery yard installments for the two VLCCs. Otherwise, for the equity portion of an investment in
	a newbuilding or a second-hand vessel, we generally pay from our own cash approximately 30% of the contract price. Repayment of the debt incurred to purchase the vessel is made from vessel operating cash flow, typically over four to twelve years,
	compared to the vessel&#146;s asset life of approximately 25 years (LNG carrier 40 years).

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:6PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	As is customary in our industry, we anticipate financing the majority of our commitments on the newbuildings with bank debt. Generally we raise 70% of the
	vessel purchase price with bank debt for a period of between six and twelve years (while the expected life of a tanker is 25 years and an LNG carrier is 40 years). For vessels for which we have secured long-term charters with first-class charterers,
	we would expect to raise up to 80% of the vessel purchase price with bank debt.

	As a result of such financing activities, long-term debt decreased in 2015 by a net amount of $18.2 million
	compared to a net decrease of $38.0 million in 2014. The debt to capital (equity plus debt) ratio was 49.7% at December&nbsp;31, 2015, or net of cash, 43.6%, and 54.6% at December&nbsp;31, 2014 or, net of cash, 50.6%.

	We have paid all of our scheduled loan installments and related loan and swap interest consistently without delay or omission. As a percentage
	of total liabilities against total assets at fair value, our consolidated leverage (a non-GAAP measure) as computed in accordance with our loan agreements at December&nbsp;31, 2015 was 47.5%, below the original loan covenant maximum of 70%, which is
	applicable to all the above loans (except one) on a fleet and total liabilities basis. All the loan agreements also include a requirement for the value of the vessel or vessels secured against the related loan to be at least 120% (in three cases
	125% and in two other cases 110%) of the outstanding associated debt at all times. As at December&nbsp;31, 2015, the value-to-loan ratios were higher than these levels and were, therefore, in compliance with this covenant in those cases. As at
	December&nbsp;31, 2014, in one term bank loan with an outstanding balance of $31.7 million, due to a fall in tanker values, the value-to-loan ratio was slightly less than the required level and, therefore, we were in non-compliance with this
	covenant in that case, until August, 2015. We did not request a waiver for this covenant nor did the lender require additional security or prepayment of part of the loan so as to bring it into compliance.

	In the event of non-compliance with the value-to-loan ratio without obtaining waivers of these value-to-loan covenants and upon request from
	our lenders, we would have to either provide the lenders acceptable additional security with a net realizable value at least equal to the shortfall, or prepay an amount, beyond scheduled short-term repayments, that would cure the non-compliance.
	During the previous periods when, in certain cases, we were in non-compliance with loan covenants, none of our lenders requested prepayment or additional collateral, except when related to a vessel sale, nor did any declare an event of default under

	non-compliances would have constituted events of default and could have resulted in the lenders requiring immediate repayment of the loans. In the above case, of only one minor non-compliance, for which adequate funds were available, there was no

	At December&nbsp;31, 2015 and 2014, we were compliant with the leverage ratio covenant contained
	in all of our bank loans. We do not expect to pay down the Company&#146;s loans in 2016 beyond the amounts that we have already classified as current liabilities. Upon an event of default, all the loan agreements, which are secured by mortgages on
	our vessels, include the right of lenders to accelerate repayments. All our loan agreements and our interest rate swap agreements also contain a cross-default provision that may be triggered by a default under one of our other loans. A cross-default
	provision means that a notice of default on one loan would result in a default on other agreements. Interest is usually payable at a variable rate, based on six-month LIBOR plus a margin. Interest rate swap instruments currently cover approximately
	22% of the outstanding debt as of April&nbsp;5, 2016. The expected coverage at the end of 2016 is estimated at 19% of expected outstanding debt. We review our hedging position relating to interest on a continuous basis and have regular discussions
	with banks with regards to terms for potential new instruments to hedge our interest.

	There can be no assurance that we will pay dividends or as to the amount of any dividend. The payment and the amount will be
	subject to the discretion of our board of directors and will depend, among other things, on available cash balances, anticipated cash needs, our results of operations, our financial condition, and any loan agreement restrictions binding us or our
	subsidiaries, as well as other relevant factors. For example, if we earned a capital gain on the sale of a vessel or newbuilding contract, we could determine to reinvest that gain instead of using it to pay dividends. Depending on our operating
	performance for that year, this could result in no dividend at all despite the existence of net income, or a dividend that represents a lower percentage of our net income. Of course, any payment of cash dividends could slow our ability to renew and
	expand our fleet, and could cause delays in the completion of our current newbuilding program.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Because we are holding a company with no
	material assets other than the stock of our subsidiaries, our ability to pay dividends will depend on the earnings and cash flow of our subsidiaries and their ability to pay dividends to us.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; TEXT-INDENT:4%; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Under the terms of our existing credit facilities, we are permitted to declare or pay a cash dividend in any year as long as the amount of the
	dividend does not exceed 50% of our net income for that year. Net income is determined based on the audited financial statements we deliver to the banks under our credit facilities which are required to be presented in accordance with U.S. generally
	accepted accounting principles. This amount can be carried forward and applied to a dividend payment in a subsequent year provided the aggregate amount of all dividends we declare and/or pay after January&nbsp;1, 1998 does not exceed 50% of our

	assets. Income we earn, or are deemed to earn, in connection with the performance of services will not constitute passive income. By contrast, rental income will generally constitute passive income (unless we are treated under certain special rules
	as deriving our rental income in the active conduct of a trade or business).

	There are legal uncertainties involved in determining whether
	the income derived from time chartering activities constitutes rental income or income derived from the performance of services. In
<I>
	Tidewater Inc. v. United States
</I>
	, 565 F.2d 299 (5th Cir. 2009), the United States Court of Appeals for the
	Fifth Circuit held that income derived from certain time chartering activities should be treated as rental income rather than services income for purposes of a foreign sales corporation provision of the Code. In a recent published guidance, however,
	the Internal Revenue Service (the &#147;IRS&#148;) states that it disagrees with the holding in
<I>
	Tidewater
</I>
	, and specifies that time charters should be treated as service contracts. On this basis, we do not believe that we were treated as a
	PFIC for our most recent taxable year or that we will be treated as a PFIC for any subsequent taxable year. This conclusion is based in part upon our beliefs regarding our past assets and income and our current projections and expectations as to our
	future business activity, including, in particular, our expectation that the proportion of our income derived from bareboat charters will not materially increase. However, we have not sought, and we do not expect to seek, an IRS ruling on this
	matter. As a result, the IRS or a court could disagree with our position. No assurance can be given that this result will not occur. In addition, although we intend to conduct our affairs in a manner to avoid, to the extent possible, being
	classified as a PFIC with respect to any taxable year, we cannot assure you that the nature of our operations will not change in the future, or that we can avoid PFIC status in the future.

	As discussed below, if we were to be treated as a PFIC for any taxable year, a United States holder

	Taxation of United States Holders that Make No Election.
</I>
	If we are treated as a PFIC for any taxable year during
	which a United States holder holds our common shares, Series B Preferred Shares, Series C Preferred Shares or Series D Preferred Shares, then, subject to the discussion of the qualified electing fund (&#147;QEF&#148;) and mark-to-market rules below,
	the United States holder will be subject to a special and adverse tax regime in respect of (1)&nbsp;gains realized on the sale or other disposition of our common shares, Series B Preferred Shares, Series C Preferred Shares or Series D Preferred
	Shares and (2)&nbsp;distributions on our common shares, Series B Preferred Shares, Series C Preferred Shares or Series D Preferred Shares to the extent that those distributions are treated as excess distributions. An excess distribution generally
	includes dividends or other distributions received from a PFIC in any taxable year of a United States holder to the extent that the amount of those distributions exceeds 125 percent of the average distributions made by the PFIC during a specified
	base period (or, if shorter, the United States holder&#146;s holding period for the shares). A United States holder that is subject to the PFIC rules (1)&nbsp;will be required to allocate excess distributions received in respect of our common
	shares, Series B Preferred Shares, Series C Preferred Shares or Series D Preferred Shares and gain realized on the sale of common shares, Series B Preferred Shares, Series C Preferred Shares or Series D Preferred Shares to each day during the United
	States holder&#146;s holding period for the common shares, (2)&nbsp;will be required to include in income as ordinary income the portion of the excess distribution or gain that is allocated to the current taxable year and to certain pre-PFIC years,
	and (3)&nbsp;will be taxable at the highest rate of taxation applicable to ordinary income for the prior years, other than pre-PFIC years, to which the excess distribution or gain is allocable, without regard to the United States holder&#146;s other
	items of income and loss for such prior taxable years (&#147;deferred tax&#148;). The deferred tax for each prior year will be increased by an interest charge for the period from the due date for tax returns for the prior year to the due date for
	tax returns for the year of the excess distribution or gain, computed at the rates that apply to underpayments of tax. Pledges of PFIC shares will be treated as dispositions for purposes of the foregoing rules. In addition, a United States holder
	who acquires common shares, Series B Preferred Shares, Series C Preferred Shares or Series D Preferred Shares from a decedent generally will not receive a stepped-up basis in the common shares, Series B Preferred Shares, Series C Preferred Shares or
	Series D Preferred Shares.

	A United States holder that holds &#147;marketable&#148; stock

	in other than de minimis quantities, on at least 15 days during each calendar quarter of the year. A United States holder that makes the mark-to-market election generally will be required to include in income each year as ordinary income an amount
	equal to the increase in value of the common shares, Series B Preferred Shares, Series C Preferred Shares or Series D Preferred Shares for that year, regardless of whether the United States holder actually sells the common shares, Series B Preferred
	Shares, Series C Preferred Shares or Series D Preferred Shares. The United States holder generally will be allowed a deduction for the decrease in value of the common shares, Series B Preferred Shares, Series C Preferred Shares or Series D Preferred
	Shares for the taxable year, to the extent of the amount of gain previously included in income under the mark-to-market rules, reduced by prior deductions under the mark-to-market rules. Any gain from the actual sale of the PFIC stock will be

	The table below provides information about our financial instruments at December&nbsp;31, 2015, which are sensitive to changes in interest
	rates, including our debt and interest rate swaps. For debt obligations, the table presents principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates. Weighted-average variable rates are based on the implied forward
	rates in the yield curves at the reporting date. For interest rate swaps, the table presents notional amounts and weighted- average interest rates by expected contractual maturity dates. Notional amounts are used to calculate the contractual
	payments to be exchanged under the contracts.

	The Company regularly
	enters into bunker swap agreements in order to hedge its exposure to bunker price fluctuations associated with the consumption of bunkers by its spot trading vessels. During 2015, the Company entered into 17 call option agreements and paid a premium
	on those call options of $1.4 million. During 2015, five call options expired. The 12 remaining call options covered 43,800 metric tons of bunker fuel, all of which expire at the end of 2016, apart from three options covering 9,000 tons in total,
	which expire at the end of 2017. The market value of these 12 call options at December&nbsp;31, 2015, amounted to $0.2 million. We estimate that for every $1.00 increase in the price of bunker fuel per metric ton, there would have been an annualized
	decrease of earnings and cash flow by $0.2 million based on our bunker consumption of 2015.

	The currency the international tanker industry is primarily using is the U.S. dollar. Virtually all of our revenues are in U.S. dollars and the
	majority of our operating costs are incurred in U.S. dollars. We incur certain operating expenses in foreign currencies, the most significant of which are in Euros. During fiscal 2015, approximately 27% of the total of our vessel and voyage costs
	and overhead expenditures were denominated in Euro. Based on 2015 Euro expenditure, therefore, we estimate that for every 1% change in the Euro/U.S. dollar rate there would be a 0.3% impact on vessel operating expenses and minimal impact on other
	cost categories apart from dry-docking which would depend on the location of the selected yard. However, we have the ability to shift our purchase of goods and services from one country to another and, thus, from one currency to another in order to
	mitigate the effects of exchange rate fluctuations. We have a policy of continuously monitoring and managing our foreign exchange exposure. On occasion, we do directly purchase amounts of Euro with U.S. dollars, but to date, we have not engaged in
	any foreign currency hedging transactions, as we do not believe we have had material risk exposure to foreign currency fluctuations.

	not consider inflation to be a significant risk to direct costs in the current and foreseeable economic environment. However, if inflation becomes a significant factor in the world economy, inflationary pressures could result in increased operating
	and financing costs.

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan

<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	A company&#146;s internal control over financial reporting is a
	process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company&#146;s
	internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1)&nbsp;pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
	company; (2)&nbsp;provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
	are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3)&nbsp;provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
	company&#146;s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
</P>
<P STYLE="MARGIN-TOP:12PT; MARGIN-BOTTOM:0PT; FONT-SIZE:10PT; FONT-FAMILY:TIMES NEW ROMAN">
	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial
	reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.&nbsp;Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of
	compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

	The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (&#147;U.S.
	GAAP&#148;) and include the accounts of Tsakos Energy Navigation Limited (the &#147;Holding Company&#148;), and its wholly-owned and majority-owned subsidiaries (collectively, the &#147;Company&#148;). As at December&nbsp;31, 2015, the Holding
	Company consolidated one (two in 2014 and 2013), variable interest entity (&#147;VIE&#148;) for which it is deemed to be the primary beneficiary, i.e. it has a controlling financial interest in this entity. A VIE is an entity that in general does
	not have equity investors with voting rights or that has equity investors that do not provide sufficient financial resources for the entity to support its activities. A controlling financial interest in a VIE is present when a company has the power
	to direct the activities of a VIE that most significantly impact the entity&#146;s economic performance and absorbs a majority of an entity&#146;s expected losses, receives a majority of an entity&#146;s expected residual returns, or both.

	Impairment of Vessels:
</I>
</B>
	The Company reviews vessels for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a vessel may not be recoverable, such as during severe
	disruptions in global economic and market conditions. When such indicators are present, a vessel to be held and used is tested for recoverability by comparing the estimate of future undiscounted net operating cash flows expected to be generated by
	the use of the vessel over its remaining useful life and its eventual disposition to its carrying amount. Net operating cash flows are determined by applying various assumptions regarding the use or possible disposition of each vessel, future
	revenues net of commissions, operating expenses, scheduled dry-dockings, expected off-hire and scrap values, and taking into account historical revenue data and published forecasts on future world economic growth and inflation. Should the carrying
	value of the vessel exceed its estimated future undiscounted net operating cash flows, impairment is measured based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair market value of the asset. The Company determines the fair value of its vessels
	based on management estimates and assumptions and by making use of available market data and taking into consideration third party valuations. The review of the carrying amounts in connection with the estimated recoverable amount for certain of the
	Company&#146;s vessels as of December&nbsp;31, 2015 and December&nbsp;31, 2014 did not indicate an impairment charge, whereas at December&nbsp;31, 2013 there were impairment charges of $28,290 (Note&nbsp;5).

	Accounting for Special Survey and Dry-docking Costs:
</I>
</B>
	The Company follows the deferral method of accounting for dry-docking and special survey costs whereby actual costs incurred are reported in Deferred
	Charges and are amortized on a straight-line basis over the period through the date the next dry-docking is scheduled to become due (approximately every five years during the first fifteen years of vessels&#146; life and every two and a half years
	within the remaining useful life of the vessels). Until December&nbsp;31, 2013, for vessels older than ten years the Company estimated that the next dry-docking would be due in two and a half years. However, according to Classification Society
	regulations, vessels can defer dry-docking costs for five years during their first fifteen years of life, instead of ten years as previously estimated. This change in estimate does not have a material effect in the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2015
	and 2014, and is not expected to have material effect in the following years. Costs relating to routine repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred. The unamortized portion of special survey and dry-docking costs for a vessel that is sold is
	included as part of the carrying amount of the vessel in determining the gain on sale of the vessel.

	Voyage revenues are generated from freight billings and time charter hire. Time charter revenue, including bare-boat hire, is recorded over the term of the charter as
	the service is provided. Revenues from voyage charters on the spot market or under contract of affreightment are recognized ratably from when a vessel becomes available for loading (discharge of the previous charterer&#146;s cargo) to when the next
	charterer&#146;s cargo is discharged, provided an agreed non-cancelable charter between the Company and the charterer is in existence, the charter rate is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured. Revenue under voyage charters
	will not be recognized until a charter has been agreed even if the vessel has discharged its previous cargo and is proceeding to an anticipated port of loading. Revenues from variable hire arrangements are recognized to the extent the variable
	amounts earned beyond an agreed fixed minimum hire are determinable at the reporting date and all other revenue recognition criteria are met. Revenue from hire arrangements with an escalation clause is recognized on a straight-line basis over the
	charter term unless another systematic and rational basis is more representative of the time pattern in which the vessel is employed. Vessel voyage and operating expenses and charter hire expense are expensed when incurred.

	The Company regularly enters into interest rate swap contracts to manage its exposure to fluctuations of interest rates associated with its specific borrowings. Also, the
	Company enters into bunker swap contracts and put or call options to manage its exposure to fluctuations of bunker prices associated with the consumption of bunkers by its vessels. Interest rate and bunker price differentials paid or received under
	the swap agreements are recognized as part of Interest and finance costs, net. On the inception of a put or call option on bunkers an asset or liability is recognized. The subsequent changes in its the fair value, and realized payments or receipts
	upon exercise of the options are recognized in the Statement of Operations as part of the interest and finance costs, net. All derivatives are recognized in the consolidated financial statements at their fair value. On the inception date of the
	derivative contract, the Company evaluates the derivative as an accounting hedge of the variability of cash flow to be paid of a forecasted transaction (&#147;cash flow&#148; hedge). Changes in the fair value of a derivative that is qualified,
	designated and highly effective as a cash flow hedge are recorded in other comprehensive income/ (loss) until earnings are affected by the forecasted transaction. Changes in the fair value of undesignated derivative instruments and the ineffective
	portion of designated derivative instruments are reported in earnings in the period in which those fair value changes occur. Realized gains or losses on early termination of undesignated derivative instruments are also classified in earnings in the
	period of termination of the respective derivative instrument.

	offsetting changes in cash flow of hedged items. When it is determined that a derivative is not highly effective as a hedge or that it has ceased to be a highly effective hedge, the Company discontinues hedge accounting prospectively. In accordance

	Going Concern:

	In August 2014, FASB issued ASU No.&nbsp;2014-15 &#150; &#147;Presentation of Financial Statements - Going Concern&#148;. ASU 2014-15 provides guidance about management&#146;s responsibility to
	evaluate whether there is substantial doubt about an entity&#146;s ability to continue as a going concern and to provide related footnote disclosures. ASU 2014-15 requires an entity&#146;s management to evaluate at each reporting period based on the

	the date that the financial statements are issued and to disclose the necessary information. ASU 2014-15 is effective for the annual period ending after December&nbsp;15, 2016, and for annual periods and interim periods thereafter. Early application

	Debt Issuance costs:
</B>
	In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU No.&nbsp;2015-03-Interest-Imputation of Interest, to simplify the presentation of debt issuance costs. The amendments in this ASU would require that debt
	issuance costs be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of debt liability, consistent with debt discounts or premiums. Management believes that this standard will not have a material effect on the
	Company&#146;s financial position.

</B>
	In July 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-11, Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory. ASU 2015-11 simplifies the
	subsequent measurement of inventory by replacing today&#146;s lower of cost or market test with a lower of cost and net realizable value test. The guidance applies only to inventories for which cost is determined by methods other than last-in
	first-out (LIFO) and the retail inventory method (RIM). Entities that use LIFO or RIM will continue to use existing impairment models (e.g., entities using LIFO would apply the lower of cost or market test). The guidance is effective for public
	business entities for fiscal years beginning after December&nbsp;15, 2016, and interim periods within those fiscal years. For all other entities, it is effective for fiscal years beginning after December&nbsp;15, 2016, and interim periods within
	fiscal years beginning after December&nbsp;15, 2017. Early adoption is permitted as of the beginning of an interim or annual reporting period. The new guidance must be applied prospectively after the date of adoption. Management believes that this
	standard will not have a material effect on the Company&#146;s financial position.

	Leases
</B>
	: In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02 Leases (Topic 842) which provides new guidance related to accounting for leases and supersedes existing U.S. GAAP on lease accounting. The ASU will require
	organizations that lease assets to recognize on the balance sheet the assets and liabilities for the rights and obligations created by those leases, unless the lease is a short term lease. Public business entities should apply the amendments in ASU
	2016-02 for fiscal years beginning after December&nbsp;15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early application is permitted for all public business entities upon issuance. Lessees (for capital and operating leases) and
	lessors (for sales-type, direct financing, and operating leases) must apply a modified retrospective transition approach for leases existing at, or entered into after, the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented in the financial
	statements. The modified retrospective approach would not require any transition accounting for leases that expired before the earliest comparative period presented. Lessees and lessors may not apply a full retrospective transition approach.
	Management is in the process of assessing the impact of the new standard on the Company&#146;s consolidated financial position and performance.

	corporation, to provide overall executive and commercial management of its affairs for a monthly fee. Per the Management Agreement of March&nbsp;8, 2007, effective from January&nbsp;1, 2008, there is a prorated adjustment if at the beginning of each
	year the Euro has appreciated by 10% or more against the U.S.&nbsp;Dollar since January&nbsp;1, 2007. In addition, there is an increase each year by a percentage figure reflecting 12 month Euribor, if both parties agree. In 2015 and 2014, the
	monthly fees for operating vessels are $27.5, $20.4 for vessels chartered in and on a bare-boat basis, and $35.8 for the LNG carrier, of which $10.0 is paid to the Management Company and $25.8 to a third party manager and $27.5 per month, of which
	$13.9 are payable to a third party manager for the VLCC

<I>
	Eurochampion 2004

	are $27.5 per month, of which $12.0 is paid to a third party manager. In addition to the Management fee, the Management Agreement provides for
	an incentive award to the Management Company, which is at the absolute discretion of the Holding Company&#146;s Board of Directors. In 2015, an award of $1,142 was granted to the Management Company and is included in the General and Administrative
	expenses in the accompanying Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive income/ (loss). In addition, a special award of $425 was paid to the Management Company in relation to capital raising offerings in 2015 and $400 in 2014 while $460 was declared
	for payments. These awards relating to offerings have been included as a deduction of additional paid in capital in the accompanying Financial Statements.

	In August 2006, the Company signed an agreement with Polaris Oil Shipping Inc. (Polaris), an affiliate of one of the
	Company&#146;s major charterers, following which Polaris acquired 49% of Mare Success S.A., a previously wholly-owned subsidiary of the Holding Company. Mare Success S.A. is the holding-company of two Panamanian registered companies which own
	respectively the vessels
<I>
	Maya
</I>
	and
<I>
	Inca
</I>
	. The agreement became effective on November&nbsp;30, 2006. Mare Success S.A. is fully consolidated in the accompanying financial statements. In the fourth quarter of 2013, Mare Success increased
	its paid-in capital by $20,408 of which $10,408 being the 51%, was contributed by the Company and $10,000 being the 49%, by Polaris. After the recapitalization, the shareholding of Mare Success S.A. remained at 51% for the Company and 49% for
	Polaris. There have been no transactions between Polaris and the Company since the incorporation of Mare Success S.A., whereas approximately 5.5% of the Company&#146;s 2015 revenue (7.0% in 2014) was generated by the charterer affiliated to Polaris.

	The Company is not expected to be subject to United States Federal income tax on their gross income from the international operations of ships.
	In general, foreign persons operating ships to and from the United States are subject to United States Federal income tax of 4% of their United States source gross transportation income, which equals 50% of their gross income from transportation to
	or from the United States. The Company believes that it is exempt from United States Federal income tax on its United States source gross transportation income, as each vessel-operating subsidiary is organized in a foreign country that grants an
	equivalent exemption to corporations organized in the United States, and derives income from the international operation of ships and satisfies the stock ownership test as defined by the Internal Revenue Code and related regulations as a result of
	the Company&#146;s stock being primarily and regularly traded on an established securities market in the United States. Under the regulations, a Company&#146;s stock is considered to be regularly traded on an established securities market if
	(i)&nbsp;one or more classes of its stock representing 50% or more of its outstanding shares, by voting power and value, is listed on the market and is traded on the market, other than in minimal quantities, on at least 60 days during the taxable
	year; and (ii)&nbsp;the aggregate number of shares of stock traded during the taxable year is at least 10% of the average number of shares of the stock outstanding during the taxable year. Other requirements such as the substantiation and reporting
	requirements under the regulations also must be satisfied to qualify for the exemption from United States Federal income tax.

	The Company performs periodic evaluations of the relative credit standing of those financial institutions that are considered in the Company&#146;s investment strategy. The Company limits its credit risk with accounts receivable by performing
	ongoing credit evaluations of its customers&#146; financial condition and generally does not require collateral for its accounts receivable and does not have any agreements to mitigate credit risk. The Company limits the exposure of non-performance
	by counterparties to derivative instruments by diversifying among counterparties with high credit ratings, and performing periodic evaluations of the relative credit standing of the counterparties.

	The carrying amounts reflected in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheet of cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, trade receivables and accounts payable approximate their

	future cash flows of the portion of one long-term bank loan with a fixed interest rate is estimated to be approximately $31,485 as compared to its carrying amount of $32,132 (Note 7). The Company performs relevant enquiries on a periodic basis to
