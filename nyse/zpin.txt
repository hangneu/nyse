	In February 2013, we repurchased 12,857,143 of our series E preferred shares from Macquarie Zhaopin Holdings Limited for a
	total consideration of US$67.5 million. We accounted for the transaction as an extinguishment of preferred shares. No gains or
	losses were recognized from the repurchase of these convertible preferred shares. The excess of the consideration transferred over
	the carrying amount of the preferred shares surrendered, amounting to RMB265.0 million was recognized as a deemed dividend, and
	resulted in an increase in net loss attributable to ordinary shareholders. The repurchased series E preferred shares were then
	cancelled by us.

	Substantially all of our operations are conducted

	amounts into U.S. dollars at specific rates solely for the convenience of the reader. Unless otherwise noted, all translations
	from Renminbi to U.S. dollars and from U.S. dollars to Renminbi in this annual report were made at a rate of RMB6.6459 to US$1.00,
	the exchange rate set forth in the H.10 statistical release of the Board of Governors of Federal Reserve Bank on June 30, 2016.
	We make no representation that any Renminbi or U.S. dollar amounts could have been, or could be, converted into U.S. dollars or
	Renminbi, as the case may be, at any particular rate, the rates stated below, or at all. The PRC government imposes control over
	its foreign currency reserves in part through direct regulation of the conversion of Renminbi into foreign exchange and through
	restrictions on foreign trade. On October 7, 2016, the certified exchange rate was RMB 6.6685 to US$1.00.

	Any actual or perceived threat of a financial
	or economic crisis in China could have a material and adverse impact on our business and results of operations. It is very difficult
	to predict how the Chinese economy may develop in the future and whether it might experience a financial or economic crisis in
	a manner and scale similar to what the United States and other developed countries have experienced in recent years. Any continuing
	or worsening slowdown in China&rsquo;s economic development could lead to tighter credit markets, increased market volatility,
	sudden drops in business and consumer confidence and dramatic changes in business and consumer behaviors. The Chinese economy was
	negatively affected by global financial crises in the past and may be further negatively impacted by uncertainties in global economy.
	Recently, there has been increasing concerns that the growth rate of China&rsquo;s gross domestic product is slowing, which weighs
	on enterprises in China, including us. According to the preliminary estimation by the National Bureau of Statistics of China, in
	2015 China&rsquo;s GDP growth rate was
<FONT STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 10PT">
	6.9
</FONT>
	%, which was the lowest since the first quarter
	of 2009. In response to uncertain economic conditions, employers may defer, reduce or stop hiring new employees. To the extent
	that any fluctuations in the Chinese economy significantly affect employers&rsquo; demand for our services or change their spending
	habits, our results of operations may be materially and adversely affected.

	more developed countries, internet access in China is subject to greater uncertainties. Telecommunications capacity constraints
	in China may impede further development of the Internet to the extent that users experience delays, transmission errors and other

	We rely on major Chinese telecommunication companies

	Concerns about our practices with regard to
	the collection, use or disclosure of personal information or other privacy-related matters, even if unfounded, could damage our
	reputation and operations. The PRC Constitution, the PRC Criminal Law and the General Principles of the PRC Civil Law protect individual

	the telecommunications and other industries from selling or otherwise illegally disclosing a citizen&rsquo;s personal information
	obtained during the course of performing duties or providing services. In addition, according to Amendment 9 to the PRC Criminal
	Law, if an organization that is a network service provider fails to perform the obligations to manage the security of information
	networks required by laws and administrative regulations and refuses to make corrections ordered by relevant regulatory authorities,
	which leads to the disclosure of its users&rsquo; information and results in damages, it may be subject to fines and the control
	person may be subject to criminal liabilities. See &ldquo;Item 4.C. Information on the Company - Regulation Relating to Value-Added
	Telecommunications Services &ndash; Information Security.&rdquo; Our internal policy also requires our employees to protect the
	personal data of our users, and employees who violate such policy are subject to disciplinary actions, including dismissal. While
	we strive to comply with all applicable data protection laws and regulations, as well as our own privacy policies, and we believe
	we are in compliance with the applicable PRC laws and regulations on data protection, any failure or perceived failure to comply
	may result in proceedings or actions against us by government entities or private individuals, which could have an adverse effect
	on our business. Moreover, failure or perceived failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations related to the collection,
	use, sharing or security of personal information or other privacy-related matters could result in a loss of confidence in us by
	customers and users, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. For example, in
	December 2014, WooYun.org, an internet forum for web security discussions, released an article claiming user data leak from the
	Zhaopin database. We believe that the allegations in this article are inaccurate and that the alleged data leak never occurred.
	We have responded to this article accordingly but we cannot assure you that there will not be similar allegations in the future,
	which could result in perceived failure of our database security measures.

	In general, we rely on the operations of our
	third-party vendors and may not have any control over the costs of the services they provide. Third-party service providers may
	raise their prices, which may not be commercially reasonable to us. Our existing vendors may not continue to provide the high-quality
	services that they currently do. To maintain good working relationships with colleges and universities, our team would need to
	maintain active communications with them, provide free training and lectures on job searches to students, and proactively reach
	out to students and student employment offices, which efforts may not always yield our intended results. If we are forced to seek
	other providers, there is no assurance that we will be able to find alternative providers willing or able to provide comparable
	high-quality services and there is no assurance that such providers will not charge us higher prices for their services. If the
	prices that we are required to pay third-party vendors for services rise significantly or we are unable to find suitable providers
	that offer comparable high-quality services, the results of our operations could be adversely affected.

	The material weakness identified relates to
	the lack of sufficient financial reporting and accounting personnel with appropriate knowledge of U.S. GAAP and SEC reporting requirements
	to properly address complex U.S. GAAP accounting issues and to prepare and review our consolidated financial statements and related
	disclosures to fulfill U.S. GAAP and SEC financial reporting requirements. Subsequent to these findings, we have taken a number
	of measures to further improve our internal control over financial reporting and disclosure. We believe the implementation of these
	measures has fully addressed the above mentioned material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting and we have
	remediated such material weakness during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2015.

	Our quarterly revenues and operating results

	Seasonal fluctuations and industry cyclicality have affected, and are likely to continue to affect, our online recruitment services
	and other services. We generally generate less revenue during the national holidays in China due to the slowdown of business during
	the holidays. In the periods following the Chinese New Year holiday and towards the end of a calendar year, we historically experienced
	an increase in recruitment activity. The Chinese New Year holiday is based on the lunar calendar, varies from year to year and
	typically lasts for two weeks, which affects our third quarter results and their comparability to financial results of the same
	quarter in prior years. During seasonal peak periods, demand for recruitment advertising and other human resource related services
	may or may not rise significantly depending on the needs of customers as well as their perceptions of the job market. We also have
	observed seasonal campus recruitment activity by customers in the second and third quarter of each fiscal year. In addition, employers&rsquo;
	spending in China has historically been cyclical, reflecting the overall economic conditions as well as the demand for human resource
	services and recruitment patterns of employers. For these and other reasons, comparing our operating results on a period-to-period
	basis may not be useful, and you should not rely on our past results as an indication of our future performance. Our operating
	results in future quarters may fall below expectations. Any of these events could cause the price of our ADSs to fluctuate widely.

	Pursuant to the PRC Regulations on the Administration
	of Talents Market, companies that purport to engage in human resources related services need to obtain the human resources service
	license. Companies conducting human resources related services without the human resources service license may be ordered to cease
	operations and a fine of up to RMB30,000 per entity may be imposed, by local human resources bureaus. As of the date of this annual
	report, 30 out of 33 operating branch offices of Beijing Wangpin have obtained human resources permits, or HR permits. With respect
	to the three operating branch offices without the HR permit, including Taiyuan, Foshan and Suzhou call centre, the relevant local
	authorities requested that employees of the respective branch offices pass a related exam, but it is uncertain when such exam will
	be held. As a result, we have not been able to obtain HR permits for those branch offices. Such branch offices with no HR permits
	contributed 2.3% of our total revenues for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016. As of the date of this annual report, no penalty
	has been imposed by local human resources bureaus on us. In addition, these branch offices may also be deemed to be engaging in
	services beyond their authorized business scope because of their lack of the HR permits, in which cases local administrations of
	industry and commerce, or local AICs, may order such branch offices to rectify, fine such branch offices in an amount ranging from
	RMB10,000 to RMB100,000 per entity, confiscate a portion of their income, or, in serious cases, revoke the business licenses of

	in the future but as of the date of this annual report it does not yet have any business operation and consequently is not currently
	required to possess HR permits. Prior to commencing human resource related services, this branch office will apply for HR permits
	accordingly. However, we cannot assure you that this branch office will obtain HR permits in time, if at all.

	agree that these contractual arrangements comply with existing PRC laws and regulations or with PRC laws and regulations that
	may be adopted in the future. Furthermore, there are substantial uncertainties regarding the interpretation and application
	of current and future PRC laws and regulations. For example, the Ministry of Commerce, or MOFCOM, published the draft of
	Foreign Investment Law, or Draft FIL, for public comments on January 19, 2015, which introduces the principle of
	&ldquo;actual control&rdquo; for determining whether a domestic company is considered a foreign invested enterprise and,
	therefore, be subject to the foreign investment restrictions or prohibitions set forth in the &ldquo;catalogue of special
	administrative measures&rdquo; to be issued later. Not only direct or indirect actual equity holding control but also actual
	control by agreements or other arrangements falls within the definition of &ldquo;actual control&rdquo; in such draft law.
	Under the Draft FIL, the consolidated affiliated entities that are controlled ultimately by foreign investors through
	contractual arrangement may not be allowed, or may be subject to the governmental approval, in the industries set forth in
	the &ldquo;catalogue of special administrative measures.&rdquo; The Draft FIL has no immediate legal effect and it is
	unclear whether and how the legislative progress will proceed. However, if enacted as proposed, the Draft FIL may materially
	impact our corporate structure and increase our compliance costs. On September 3, 2016, the Standing Committee of the
	National People&rsquo;s Congress passed a decision in connection with the revision of the Wholly Foreign-invested Enterprise
	Law and three other laws, which were implemented on October 1, 2016. According to this decision, formation of a
	foreign-invested enterprise in a sector not subject to special entry administrative measures will be simplified by requiring
	only a government filing instead of a government approval. The special entry administrative measures will be separately
	promulgated by the PRC State Council. Subsequently, on October 8, 2016, MOFCOM published the Provisional Measures on Filing
	Administration for Establishment and Change of Foreign-invested Enterprises, or Foreign-invested Enterprises Filing Measures,
	which aims to implement and elaborate upon the filing requirements, procedures, supervision and other related matters for
	foreign-invested enterprises in sectors not subject to special entry administrative measures. According to an interpretation
	of the Foreign-invested Enterprises Filing Measures published by MOFCOM on October 8, 2016, foreign investments that are
	in the prohibited, restricted or encouraged industries and that are subject to the equity and senior management restrictions
	set forth in the Catalogue for the Guidance of Foreign Investment Industries (2015), which was jointly implemented by
	the National Development and Reform Commission and MOFCOM and became effective on April 10, 2015, will continue to be subject

	Under the current contractual arrangements,
	we rely on the performance by our consolidated affiliated entities and their respective shareholders of their respective obligations
	under the contracts to exercise control over our consolidated affiliated entities. For example, our consolidated affiliated entities
	and their respective shareholders could breach their contractual arrangements with us by, among other things, failing to operate
	our business in an acceptable manner or taking other actions that are detrimental to our interests. Our consolidated affiliated
	entities and their respective shareholders may fail to take certain actions required for our business or follow our instructions
	despite their contractual obligations to do so. If our consolidated affiliated entities or their respective shareholders fail to
	perform their obligations under the contractual arrangements with us, we may have to restructure our business operations, and/or
	incur substantial costs and resources to enforce our rights under the contracts and rely on legal remedies under PRC law, including
	seeking specific performance or injunctive relief and claiming damages, which may not be effective. For example, we terminated
	the contractual arrangement with a former consolidated affiliated entity, Henan Wangpin Advertising Co., Ltd., or Henan Wangpin,
	in 2012, partly because a former non-executive employee in Henan who was a direct equity holder of Henan Wangpin refused to transfer
	his equity interest in this entity to an individual designated by us despite his contractual obligations to do so. Henan Wangpin
	accounted for approximately 1.5% of our total revenues for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2012 and has been deconsolidated since
	May 2012. We have conducted our business through our newly established branch office of our joint venture in Henan Province since
	2012, and the former employee who is a registered owner of Henan Wangpin does not hold any equity interest in our company or any
	of our other consolidated affiliated entities. Although we have not experienced any material adverse impact on our business or
	results of operations due to the above changes, if the shareholders of our consolidated affiliated entities were to refuse to transfer
	their equity interests in these entities to us or our designee when and if we request so, or if they were otherwise to act in bad
	faith against us, then we may have to take legal actions to compel them to perform their contractual obligations, or they may bring
	claims against us to demand their economic and other rights in our consolidated affiliated entities by virtue of the fact that
	they are direct equity holders of these entities. PRC laws and regulations governing the validity of our contractual arrangements
	are uncertain and the government authorities, including courts, have broad discretion in interpreting these laws and regulations.
	See &ldquo;Item 3.D. Key Information&mdash;Risk Factors&mdash;Risks Related to Our Corporate Structure&mdash;If the PRC government
	determines that the agreements that establish the structure for operating our business in China do not comply with applicable PRC
	laws and regulations, we could be subject to severe penalties&rdquo; and &ldquo;Item 3.D. Risk Factors&mdash;Risks Related to Doing
	Business in China&mdash;Uncertainties with respect to the PRC legal system could have a material adverse effect on us.&rdquo; In
	addition, the shareholders of our consolidated affiliated entities may not act in the best interests of our company or may not
	perform their obligations under these contracts.

	reflect the fair market value of the equity interests that are pledged under the equity pledge agreements; rather, the registered
	capital amount reflects the amount of capital required to be contributed to the consolidated affiliated entity under its articles
	of association by the holders of its equity interests. The value secured by equity pledges is not limited to the amount of the
	registered capital stated on the application form. Instead, under the equity pledge agreements, it covers all debts and liabilities

	does not affect the validity of the equity pledge agreements or our ability to enforce the agreements against the current shareholders
	of our consolidated affiliated entities. However, the equity pledges, which form part of the contractual arrangements with our
	consolidated affiliated entities, will not be deemed validly created security interests under the PRC Property Rights Law until
	they are registered. Until the equity pledge is registered, we may not be able to successfully enforce this pledge, and will not
	be able to seek remedies against any third party who acquires the equity interest in this consolidated affiliated entity in good
	faith. Should a third party acquire the equity interest in good faith, we may lose control of this business and may not be able

	The payment of dividends by entities organized
	in China is subject to limitations. In particular, regulations in China currently permit payment of dividends only out of accumulated
	profits as determined in accordance with PRC accounting standards and regulations. Except for joint ventures, which can set aside
	reserve funds at their boards of directors&rsquo; own discretion, PRC companies are required to set aside at least 10% of their
	after-tax profit based on PRC accounting standards each year to their general reserves until the accumulative amount of such reserves
	reaches 50% of their registered capital. These reserves are not distributable as cash dividends. In addition, PRC companies may
	allocate a portion of their after-tax profit to their staff welfare and bonus fund at the discretion of their boards of directors.
	In October 2013, we were paid a cash dividend of RMB224.1 million by Beijing Wangpin, our joint venture. Our other PRC subsidiaries
	and affiliated entities historically have not allocated any of their after-tax profits to staff welfare and bonus funds, since
	there is no legal requirement to do so, but they may nevertheless decide to set aside such funds in the future. There is no maximum
	amount of after-tax profit that a company may contribute to such funds. Any direct or indirect limitation on the ability of our
	PRC subsidiaries, including our joint venture, to distribute dividends and other distributions to us could materially and adversely
	limit our ability to make investments or acquisitions at the holding company level, pay dividends or otherwise fund and conduct

	Under the PRC Enterprise Income Tax Law, or
	EIT Law, an enterprise established outside of the PRC with &ldquo;de facto management bodies&rdquo; within the PRC is considered
	a &ldquo;resident enterprise,&rdquo; meaning it can be treated in a manner similar to a Chinese enterprise for enterprise income
	tax purposes, i.e., it is required to pay enterprise income tax on income derived from sources inside and outside China at a tax
	rate of 25%, although the dividends paid to one resident enterprise from another may qualify as &ldquo;tax-exempt income.&rdquo;
	The implementation regulations of the EIT Law define a &ldquo;de facto management body&rdquo; as a body that has substantial and
	overall management and control over the manufacturing and business operations, personnel and human resources, finances and properties
	of an enterprise, and provides that if the foreign enterprise is deemed to be a PRC resident enterprise, dividends and other income
	obtained by the shareholder from the deemed PRC resident enterprise will be considered PRC-source income and subject to PRC withholding
	tax, which may be further reduced depending on provision in the double taxation agreement between China and the relevant country.
	A circular issued by the PRC State Administration of Taxation on April 22, 2009, or &ldquo;Circular 82,&rdquo; specifies that a
	foreign enterprise controlled by a PRC company or a PRC company group will be classified as a PRC &ldquo;resident enterprise&rdquo;
	if the following requirements are satisfied: (i) the senior management and core management departments in charge of its daily operations
	function are mainly in the PRC; (ii) its financial and human resources decisions are subject to determination or approval by persons
	or bodies in the PRC; (iii) its major assets, accounting books, company seals, and minutes and files of its board and shareholders&rsquo;
	meetings are located or kept in the PRC; and (iv) at least half of the enterprise&rsquo;s directors with voting rights or senior
	management reside in the PRC. Although the Circular 82 only applies to offshore enterprises controlled by PRC enterprises and not
	those controlled by PRC individuals or by foreign individuals or enterprises, the determining criteria set forth in the Circular
	82 may reflect the State Administration of Taxation&rsquo;s general position on how the &ldquo;de facto management body&rdquo;
	test should be applied in determining the tax resident status of offshore enterprises, regardless of whether they are controlled
	by PRC enterprises or PRC individuals.

	We do not believe that Zhaopin Limited is a
	PRC resident enterprise because it does not meet the above conditions. Zhaopin Limited is a company incorporated outside the PRC,
	and keeps its respective key assets and records, including resolutions of board of directors and resolutions of shareholders, outside
	of the PRC. In addition, we are not aware of any offshore holding companies with similar corporate structures to ours that have
	been deemed to be PRC &ldquo;resident enterprises&rdquo; by the PRC tax authorities. Therefore, we do not believe Zhaopin Limited
	should be treated as a &ldquo;resident enterprise&rdquo; for PRC tax purposes. However, as the tax resident status of an enterprise
	is subject to determination by the PRC tax authorities and uncertainties remain with respect to the interpretation of the term
	&ldquo;de facto management body&rdquo; as applicable to our offshore entities, we may be considered a resident enterprise and may
	therefore be subject to the enterprise income tax at 25% on our global income. If we are considered a resident enterprise and earn
	income other than dividends from our PRC subsidiary, a 25% enterprise income tax on our global income could significantly increase
	our tax burden and materially and adversely affect our cash flow and profitability. Moreover, the &ldquo;resident enterprise&rdquo;
	classification could result in a situation in which a 10% withholding tax is imposed on dividends we pay to our non-PRC resident
	enterprise shareholders, a 10% PRC tax is imposed on gains derived by our non-PRC resident enterprise shareholders from transferring
	our shares or ADSs (unless the holder is eligible for a treaty that provides a reduced rate), a 20% withholding tax is imposed
	on dividends we pay to our non-PRC resident individual shareholders and a 20% PRC tax is imposed on gains derived by our non-PRC
	resident individual shareholders from transferring our ordinary shares or our ADSs (unless the holder is eligible for a treaty
	that provides a reduced rate), in each case, if such income is considered PRC-sourced income by the relevant PRC authorities. This
	could have the effect of increasing our and our shareholders&rsquo; effective income tax rates and may require us to deduct withholding
	tax from any dividends we pay to our non-PRC shareholders. In addition to the uncertainty regarding how the &ldquo;resident enterprise&rdquo;
	classification may apply, it is also possible that the rules may change in the future, possibly with retroactive effect.

	has an effective tax rate of less than 12.5% or (ii) does not impose income tax on foreign income of its residents, the non-resident
	enterprise that is the transferor is required to report the Indirect Transfer to the competent tax authority of the PRC resident
	enterprise. Using a &ldquo;substance over form&rdquo; principle, the PRC tax authority may disregard the existence of the overseas
	holding company if it lacks a reasonable commercial purpose and was established for the purpose of reducing, avoiding or deferring
	PRC tax. As a result, gains derived from such Indirect Transfer may be subject to PRC withholding tax at a rate of up to 10%. SAT
	Circular 698 also provides that where a non-PRC resident enterprise transfers its equity interests in a PRC resident enterprise
	to its related parties at a price that does not comply with arm&rsquo;s length principles, the relevant tax authority has the power

	On February 3, 2015, the SAT issued Notice 7

	its tax jurisdiction to capture not only Indirect Transfers as set forth under SAT Circular 698 but also transactions involving
	transfer of real property in China and the assets of an &ldquo;establishment or place&rdquo; situated in China, of a non-PRC resident
	enterprise through the offshore transfer of a foreign intermediate holding company. Notice 7 also interprets the term &ldquo;transfer
	of the equity interest in a foreign intermediate holding company&rdquo; broadly. In addition, Notice 7 provides clearer criteria
	than SAT Circular 698 on how to assess reasonable commercial purposes and introduces safe harbor scenarios applicable to internal
	group restructurings. However, it also raises challenges for both the foreign transferor and transferee of the Indirect Transfer
	as they are required to make a self-assessment of whether the transaction should be subject to PRC tax and to file or withhold

	The conversion of Renminbi into foreign currencies,
	including U.S. dollars, is based on rates set by the People&rsquo;s Bank of China, or the PBOC. The PRC government allowed the
	Renminbi to appreciate by more than 20% against the U.S. dollar between July 2005 and July 2008. Between July 2008 and June 2010,
	this appreciation halted and the exchange rate between the Renminbi and the U.S. dollar remained within a narrow range. Since June
	2010, the PRC government has allowed the Renminbi to appreciate slowly against the U.S. dollar again. On August 11, 2015, however,
	the PBOC allowed the Renminbi to depreciate by approximately 2% against the U.S. dollar. On June 27, 2016, the PBOC further allowed
	the Renminbi to depreciate by approximately 0.9% against the U.S. dollar, the biggest intra-day downward move since August 2015.
	Changes in value of Renminbi against U.S. dollar may occur relatively suddenly, as was the case for examples in August 2015 and
	June 2016. It is difficult to predict how market forces or PRC or U.S. government policy may impact the exchange rate between the

	Substantially all of our revenues and costs
	are denominated in Renminbi. At the Cayman Islands holding company level, we may rely on dividends and other fees paid to us by

	adversely affect our cash flows, net revenues, earnings and financial position, and the value of, and any dividends payable on,
	our ADSs in U.S. dollars. For example, an appreciation of the Renminbi against the U.S. dollar would make any new Renminbi-denominated
	investments or expenditures more costly to us, to the extent that we need to convert U.S. dollars into Renminbi for such purposes.
	Conversely, a significant depreciation of the Renminbi against the U.S. dollar may significantly reduce the U.S. dollar equivalent
	of our earnings, which in turn could adversely affect the price of our ADSs. If we decide to convert Renminbi into U.S. dollars

	The PRC government imposes controls on the convertibility
	of the Renminbi into foreign currencies and, in certain cases, the remittance of currency out of China. Under our current corporate
	structure, the income of our Cayman Islands holding company is primarily derived from a share of the earnings from our PRC subsidiaries.
	Revenues of our PRC subsidiaries are all denominated in Renminbi. Shortages in the availability of foreign currency may restrict
	the ability of our PRC subsidiaries to remit sufficient foreign currency to pay dividends or other payments to us, or otherwise
	satisfy their foreign currency-denominated obligations. Under existing PRC foreign exchange regulations, payments of current account
	items, including profit distributions, interest payments and expenditures from trade-related transactions, can be made in foreign
	currencies without prior approval from SAFE by complying with certain procedural requirements. However, for any PRC company, dividends
	can be declared and paid only out of the retained earnings of that company under PRC law. Furthermore, approval from SAFE or its
	local branch is required where Renminbi is to be converted into foreign currency and remitted out of China to pay capital expenses,
	such as the repayment of loans denominated in foreign currencies. Specifically, under the existing exchange restrictions, without
	a prior approval of SAFE, cash generated from the operations of our subsidiaries in China may be used to pay dividends by our PRC
	subsidiaries to our company and pay employees of our PRC subsidiaries who are located outside China in a currency other than the
	Renminbi. With a prior approval from SAFE, cash generated from the operations of our PRC subsidiaries and consolidated affiliated
	entities may be used to pay off debt in a currency other than the Renminbi owed by our subsidiaries and consolidated affiliated
	entities to entities outside China, and make other capital expenditures outside China in a currency other than the Renminbi. The
	PRC government may also at its discretion restrict access in the future to foreign currencies for current account transactions.
	If the foreign exchange control system prevents us from obtaining sufficient foreign currency to satisfy our currency demands,
	we may not be able to pay dividends in foreign currencies to our shareholders, including holders of our ADSs.

	for either of the proposed going private transactions to be consummated, we must first enter into a merger agreement with one of
	the Buyer Groups that is approved by our board of directors and later by our shareholders. If one of the going private transactions
	is consummated, it would cause us to be delisted from the New York Stock Exchange and become a private company, in which event
	our shareholders, other than those in the approved Buyer Group, would not be able to participate in our future growth. If neither
	of the proposed going private transactions is approved by either our directors or our shareholders, or is for any other reason
	not consummated, it could adversely affect the market price of our ADSs. Whether consummated or not, the proposed going private
	transactions risk may divert management focus, employee attention and other resources from strategic opportunities and from operational
	matters. Also, as either of the going private transactions develops, certain events such as the execution of any merger agreement,
	completion of the merger or an amendment to or termination of any merger agreement, may increase the volatility of the trading
	price of our ADSs. Furthermore, we could be subject to potential lawsuits in connection with the proposed going private transactions.

	We are an emerging growth company, as defined
	in the JOBS Act, and we may take advantage of certain exemptions from various requirements applicable to other public companies
	that are not emerging growth companies. Most of such requirements relate to disclosures that we would only be required to make
	if we cease to be a foreign private issuer in the future. Nevertheless, as a foreign private issuer that is an emerging growth
	company, we will not be required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act for
	up to five fiscal years after the date of our initial public offering. We will remain an emerging growth company until the earliest
	of (i) the last day of our fiscal year during which we have total annual gross revenues of at least US$1 billion; (ii) the last
	day of our fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the completion of our initial public offering, which was completed in
	June 2014; (iii) the date on which we have, during the previous three-year period, issued more than US$1 billion in non-convertible
	debt; or (iv) the date on which we are deemed to be a &ldquo;large accelerated filer&rdquo; under the Exchange Act. When we are
	no longer deemed to be an emerging growth company, we will not be entitled to the exemption provided in the JOBS Act discussed
	above. We cannot predict if investors will find our ADSs less attractive as a result of our reliance on exemptions under the JOBS
	Act. If some investors find our ADSs less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our ADSs.

	The trading prices of our ADSs are likely to
	be volatile and could fluctuate widely due to factors beyond our control. This may happen because of broad market and industry
	factors, such as the performance and fluctuation in the market prices or the underperformance or declining financial results of
	other companies based in China that have listed their securities in the United States in recent years. The securities of some of
	these companies have experienced significant volatility since their initial public offerings, including, in some cases, substantial
	price declines in the trading prices of their securities. For example, many China-based companies listed in the United States have
	experienced sharp decline in the trading prices of their securities since June 2015, fueled mostly by the investor community&rsquo;s
	concern over the prospect of the Chinese economy. The trading performances of other Chinese companies&rsquo; securities after their
	offerings may also affect the attitudes of investors toward Chinese companies listed in the United States, which consequently may
	impact the trading performance of our ADSs, regardless of our actual operating performance. In addition, any negative news or perceptions
	about inadequate corporate governance practices or fraudulent accounting, corporate structure or matters of other Chinese companies
	may also negatively affect the attitudes of investors towards Chinese companies in general, including us, regardless of whether
	we have conducted any inappropriate activities. In addition, securities markets may from time to time experience significant price
	and volume fluctuations that are not related to our operating performance, which may have a material and adverse effect on the
	market price of our ADSs.

	actions brought in the Cayman Islands, to impose liabilities against us predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the securities

	although there is no statutory enforcement in the Cayman Islands of judgments obtained in the United States, the courts of the
	Cayman Islands will recognize and enforce a foreign money judgment of a foreign court of competent jurisdiction without retrial
	on the merits based on the principle that a judgment of a competent foreign court imposes upon the judgment debtor an obligation

	We have also been advised by our Cayman Islands
	legal counsel that, under Cayman Islands law, the register of members (shareholders) is prima facie evidence of title to shares
	and this register would not record a third party interest in such shares. However, there is a risk that the register does not reflect
	the correct legal positions of the members (shareholders) because there are certain limited circumstances where an application
	may be made to a Cayman Islands court for a determination on whether the register of members reflects the correct legal position.
	Further, Cayman Islands courts have the power to order that the register of members maintained by a company should be rectified
	where they consider that the register of members is not accurate. As far as we are aware, such applications are rarely made in
	the Cayman Islands, but if this were to occur in respect of the ordinary shares, then the validity of such shares may be subject
	to re-examination by a Cayman Islands court.

	The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as well as rules

	As a company with less than US$1.0 billion in revenues for our last fiscal year, we qualify as an &ldquo;emerging growth company&rdquo;
	pursuant to the JOBS Act. An emerging growth company may take advantage of specified reduced reporting and other requirements that

	under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 in the assessment of the emerging growth company&rsquo;s internal control over

	accounting standards. However, we have elected to &ldquo;opt out&rdquo; of this provision and, as a result, we will comply with

	expenses to defend the suit. Any such class action suit, whether or not successful, could harm our reputation and restrict our

	spanning 34 cities across China as of June 30, 2016. Our team is equipped with specialized human resources expertise and knowledge
	in different industry verticals, particularly the real estate, financial services, automotive, education and training and information
	technology industries. Such expertise and knowledge helps our sales personnel understand customer needs and assist them in developing
	their recruitment strategies. We operate two call centers in Beijing and Suzhou, which provide customer support services and reaches
	out to potential customers, including those located in cities where we do not already have an office. Our call centers also facilitate
	the acquisition of new customers in lower-tier cities, expand our market share in southern China, and enable us to better serve
	small-and medium sized enterprise s in a more cost-effective manner. This sales structure allows us to quickly expand into new
	markets, in particular, areas outside of tier-one and two cities.

	Seasonal fluctuations and industry cyclicality
	have affected, and are likely to continue to affect, our online recruitment services and campus recruitment services. We generally
	generate less revenue during the national holidays in China due to the slowdown of business and reduced customer activities during
	the holidays, especially online recruitment services revenues. And we have observed that our campus recruitment revenues and assessment
	revenues are typically higher in the second and third quarters of each fiscal year, which is the college graduation season and
	peak season for campus recruitment events as well as assessment events. During seasonal peak periods, demand for recruitment advertising
	and other human resource related services may or may not rise significantly depending on the needs of customers as well as their
	perceptions of the job market. In addition, employers&rsquo; spending in China has historically been cyclical, reflecting the overall
	economic conditions as well as the demand for human resource services and recruitment patterns of employers. While this seasonality
	of our business has not been quite apparent historically due to the rapid growth in revenues that we experienced in recent years,
	we may experience reductions in growth on a successive quarter basis due to these seasonal factors or due to other factors.

	telecommunications enterprises in China to be established as Sino-foreign equity joint ventures. In addition, pursuant to the FITE
	Regulations and the relevant WTO agreements, foreign investors in a foreign-invested telecommunications enterprise engaging in
	value-added telecommunications services may hold up to 50% of the equity interest of such enterprise. The relevant rules do not

	to the MIIT Notice, if any foreign investor intends to invest in a PRC telecommunications business, a foreign-invested telecommunications
	enterprise must be established and such enterprise must apply for the relevant telecommunications business licenses in accordance
	with the Regulations for the Administration of Foreign-Invested Telecommunications Enterprises, as amended. Under the MIIT Notice,
	domestic telecommunications enterprises may not rent, transfer or sell a telecommunications license to foreign investors in any
	form, nor may they provide any resources, premises, facilities and other assistance in any form to foreign investors for their
	illegal operation of any telecommunications business in China. It also requires the domain names and trademarks used by any value-added

	On September 25, 2000, the State Council promulgated

	to the Internet Measures, commercial operators of the internet information services in China must obtain a value-added telecommunications
	license, or ICP license, from the relevant government authorities. If a commercial operator of internet information services fails
	to obtain an ICP license, the competent PRC regulatory authorities may levy fines, confiscate its income (if any) or even block
	its website. In addition, a commercial operator of internet information services must conduct its business in accordance with the
	detailed specifications provided in its ICP license. According to the Administrative Measures for the Telecommunication Business
	Operating Licenses, which was promulgated on March 3, 2009 and amended subsequently, the ICP license is subject to annual review
	and the results of such review will be notified to SAIC or its local counterparts and become public information. After the ICP
	license is granted, such commercial operator of internet information services should display the number of such license in a conspicuous
	place on the homepage of its website and closely monitor its website in order to remove content that might be deemed &ldquo;harmful.&rdquo;

	Internet Protection Measures, which require all ICPs to keep records of certain information about its users (including user registration
	information, log-in and log-out time, IP address, content and time of posts by users) for at least 60 days and submit the above
	information as required by laws and regulations. The ICPs must regularly update information security and censorship systems for
	their websites with local public security authorities, and must also report any public dissemination of prohibited content. If
	the ICPs violate these measures, the PRC government may revoke its ICP license and shut down its websites. In addition, the PRC
	State Secrecy Bureau has issued provisions authorizing the blocking of access to any website it deems to be leaking national secrets
	or failing to comply with the relevant legislation regarding the protection of state secrets. Moreover, according to Amendment
	9 to the PRC Criminal Law, if an organization that is a network service provider fails to perform the obligations to manage the

	On December 28, 2012, the Standing Committee
	of the National People&rsquo;s Congress enacted the Decision to Enhance the Protection of Network Information, or the Information
	Protection Decision, to further enhance the protection of users&rsquo; personal information in electronic form. The Information
	Protection Decision provides that internet content providers, or ICPs, must expressly inform their users of the purpose, manner
	and scope of the collection and use of users&rsquo; personal information by internet information services providers, and collect
	and use users&rsquo; personal information only with the consent of the users and only within the scope of such consent. The Information
	Protection Decision also mandates that ICPs and their employees must keep strictly confidential users&rsquo; personal information
	that ICPs collect, and that ICPs must take such technical and other measures as are necessary to safeguard the information against
	disclosure, damages and loss. Compliance with current regulations and regulations that may come into effect in these areas may
	increase our expenses related to regulatory compliance, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and
	operating results.

	On July 16, 2013, MIIT issued the Order for

	the provision of its services, and it must disclose to its users the purpose, methods and scope of such collection or use and obtain
	consent from the users whose information is being collected or used. ICPs are also required to establish and publish their rules
	relating to the collection and use of personal information, keep the collected information strictly confidential, and take technological

	The principal regulations governing foreign
	currency exchange in China are the Foreign Exchange Administration Regulations, as amended in August 2008. Under the Regulations,
	Renminbi are freely convertible for current account items, including the distribution of dividends, interest payments, trade and
	service-related foreign exchange transactions. In order to convert Renminbi for capital account items, such as direct investments,
	loans, repatriation of investments and investments in securities outside of China, the prior approval of, and/or registration with,
	State Administration of Foreign Exchange, or SAFE, or other relevant PRC governmental authorities, are required.

	On August 29, 2008, SAFE promulgated Circular
	142, which regulates the purposes for which foreign-invested companies may convert foreign currency into Renminbi. The notice requires
	that the registered capital of a foreign-invested company settled in Renminbi converted from foreign currencies may only be used
	within the business scope approved by the applicable governmental authority and may not be used for equity investments in the PRC.
	In addition, foreign-invested companies may not change how they use such capital without SAFE&rsquo;s approval, and may not in
	any case use such capital to repay RMB loans if they have not used the proceeds of such loans. Violations of Circular 142 can result
	in severe penalties, including heavy fines. On March 3, 2015, SAFE promulgated a Circular 19, which became effective on June 1,
	2015, superseding Circular 142. According to Circular 19, although it restates certain restrictions on use of investment capital
	in foreign currency by a foreign-invested company, it specifies that the registered capital of a foreign-invested company in foreign
	currency can be converted into RMB voluntarily and be used for equity investment in the PRC subject to certain reinvestment registrations
	with local SAFE made by the invested company. On June 9, 2016, SAFE issued Circular 16, which became effective on the same date.
	Although Circular 16 further extends the reform to cover foreign currency income under the capital account, including capital,
	foreign debt and proceeds from offshore offering and listing, the foreign-invested company&rsquo;s foreign currency income and
	its settlement capital under the capital account cannot be used directly and indirectly outside the business scope of the foreign-invested
	company or the prohibited items regulated by laws and regulations. However, since Circular 16 is newly issued, its interpretation
	and enforcement involve significant uncertainties.

	.
	Pursuant to the exclusive equity option agreement among Zhilian Wangpin, Zhilian Sanke and the shareholders of Zhilian Sanke, Zhilian
	Sanke&rsquo;s shareholders have granted Zhilian Wangpin or its designees an exclusive option to purchase, to the extent permitted
	under PRC law, all or part of their equity interest in Zhilian Sanke in consideration for the loans extended to Zhilian Sanke&rsquo;s
	shareholders under the loan agreement mentioned below. Pursuant to the agreement, Zhilian Wangpin has the option to acquire the
	equity interest at the lowest price then permitted by PRC law in consideration of the cancellation of all or part of the loans
	extended to Zhilian Sanke&rsquo;s shareholders under the loan agreement. Zhilian Wangpin or its designated representatives have
	sole discretion to decide when to exercise such option, either in part or in full, although the transfer of equity ownership resulting
	from the exercise of the option is subject to governmental approval and taxation. See &ldquo;Item 3.D. Key Information&mdash;Risk
	Factors&mdash;Risk Related to Our Corporate Structure&mdash;If we exercise the option to acquire equity ownership of our consolidated
	affiliated entities, the ownership transfer shall be approved or filed with PRC governmental authorities and subject to taxation,
	which may result in substantial costs.&rdquo; Zhilian Wangpin or its designated representatives are entitled to exercise the option
	an unlimited number of times until all of the equity interests have been acquired, and can freely transfer the option to any third
	party with a written notice to Zhilian Sanke&rsquo;s shareholders. Without Zhilian Wangpin&rsquo;s prior written consent, Zhilian
	Sanke&rsquo;s shareholders may not transfer, sell, pledge or otherwise dispose of their equity interest in Zhilian Sanke in any
	way. The term of this agreement is ten years and must be extended upon Zhilian Wangpin&rsquo;s written notice prior to the expiration
	date. The exclusive equity option agreement remains in full force and effect during the term of the agreement and extended period
	unless Zhilian Wangpin gives advance written notice of termination to the shareholders of Zhilian Sanke or Zhilian Sanke files
	bankruptcy, is dissolved or is forced to be closed.

	We do not have any equity interest in any
	of our consolidated affiliated entities except for Harbin Zhilian Wangcai Advertising Co., Ltd. However, as a result of contractual
	arrangements, we retain control over and are considered the primary beneficiary of each of our consolidated affiliated entities,
	and we have consolidated the financial results of these companies in our consolidated financial statements in accordance with generally
	accepted accounting principles of the United States, or U.S. GAAP. If our PRC consolidated affiliated entities and their shareholders
	fail to perform their respective obligations under the contractual arrangements, we could be limited in our ability to enforce
	the contractual arrangements that give us effective control over our consolidated affiliated entities and consequently, we may
	be unable to conduct our internet related operations because the ICP License and domain name are owned by Zhilian Sanke and we
	may potentially lose control over Beijing Wangpin, our joint venture. Further, if we are unable to maintain effective control,
	we may not be able to continue to consolidate the financial results of our consolidated affiliated entities in our financial statements.
	Although we are able to consolidate the financial results of our consolidated affiliated entities, this does not mean that we are
	able to have unfettered access to the revenues and profits of our wholly owned subsidiaries and consolidated affiliated entities
	due to the significant PRC legal restrictions on the payment of dividends by PRC companies, foreign exchange control restrictions
	and the restrictions on foreign investment, among other restrictions. In October 2013, we were paid a cash dividend of RMB224.1
	million from Beijing Wangpin, our joint venture. We did not receive any service fees from our consolidated affiliated entities
	in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2014, 2015 and 2016. We mostly conduct our human resources business through the branch offices
	of our joint venture instead of relying on contractual arrangements with our consolidated affiliated entities. We are in the process
	of liquidating five consolidated affiliated entities. As of the date of this annual report, such subsidiaries and consolidated

	Under our contractual arrangements, the

	Technology Co., Ltd. have registered their equity pledge with the relevant local administration for industry and commerce, while
	Shenyang Zhilian Wangpin Advertising Co., Ltd. has not made such registrations. The lack of registration of the equity pledge does
	not affect the validity of the equity pledge agreements or our ability to enforce the agreements against the current shareholders
	of our consolidated affiliated entities. However, the equity pledges, which form part of the contractual arrangements with our
	consolidated affiliated entities, will not be deemed validly created security interests under the PRC Property Rights Law until

	the equity interest in good faith, we may lose control of this business and may not be able to consolidate the assets, liabilities

	For the fiscal years ended June 30, 2014,
	2015 and 2016, the consolidated affiliated entity that has not registered its equity pledge, Shenyang Zhilian Wangpin Advertising
	Co., Ltd., contributed 0.2%, 0.04% and 0.0004% of our total revenues, respectively. As of the date of this annual report, this
	consolidated affiliated entity has a total registered capital of RMB0.5 million. The registered capital amount, which represents
	corresponding equity interests to be pledged, is the amount required by the SAIC to be stated in the registration form of the equity
	interest pledges. However, the registered capital amount does not reflect the fair market value of the equity interests that are
	pledged under the equity pledge agreements; rather, the registered capital amount reflects the amount of capital required to be
	contributed to the consolidated affiliated entity under its articles of association by the holders of its equity interests. The
	value secured by equity pledges is not limited to the amount of the registered capital stated on the registration form. Instead,
	under the equity pledge agreements, it covers all debts and liabilities arising from the relevant principal agreements under our
	contractual arrangements. We are preparing necessary documents required by local authorities to register the equity pledge of this
	consolidated affiliated entity, but it is difficult to predict the amount of time required to complete this equity pledge registration.
	Further, under PRC law and the equity pledge agreements, in the event of a default under our contractual arrangements, our primary
	remedy would be to engage in a public auction or sale of the shares and not a direct transfer of the pledged equity interest to
	us if we choose to enforce the pledge. Such an auction or sale may not result in our receipt of full value of the equity or the
	business of the entities. Under our contractual arrangements, the PRC shareholders of our consolidated affiliated entities have
	agreed to pledge all their equity interests therein as collateral to us. For a detailed description of the regulatory environment

	Our revenues are significantly affected
	by the growth and development of the Chinese economy, the recruitment services market in general, and our market position in the
	competitive landscape. China&rsquo;s strong economic growth and structural transformations to service-based economy have resulted
	in an expansion of labor markets, increasing job opportunities and growing demand for educated and skilled workers. This has elevated
	the importance of identifying and attracting qualified employees in China and increased demand for our recruitment services. Our
	future revenue growth will depend significantly upon our ability to gain or maintain market share to capitalize on China&rsquo;s
	continued economic growth.

	Our online recruitment services revenues,

	The key growth driver of our online recruitment
	services revenues in our historical periods has primarily been the growth in the number of customers using these services. Because
	new customers tend to initially select lower-priced services, increases in the number of new customers generally result in higher
	aggregate online recruitment services revenues but lower average revenue per unique customer. We set the prices for our services
	based on the length of contracts, the number of job postings our customers place on our website, the size and location of display
	advertisements and the number of resumes our customers can access. The prices charged are generally affected by our ability to
	provide valuable services, locate suitable candidates and the prices charged by our competitors for comparable services within
	the same city or geographic area.

	Our online recruitment services revenues
	have continued to grow, primarily because of (i) the growing acceptance of the Internet as a recruitment and job-search channel
	in China; (ii) the advantages offered by online recruitment services that better address the evolving and increasingly sophisticated
	needs of both job seekers and employers; and (iii) our ability to attract and retain users and customers using our online recruitment
	services. Our contract terms typically require customers to pay us the full price of all services purchased within five days of
	entering into a contract for online recruitment services, although we may offer certain credit terms to selected customers on a
	case-by-case basis.

	Effective January 1, 2012, the PRC Ministry
	of Finance and the State Administration of Taxation launched the Value Added Tax (&ldquo;VAT&rdquo;) Pilot Program (the &ldquo;Pilot
	Program&rdquo;) for certain industries in certain regions. According to the implementation circulars released by the Ministry of
	Finance (&ldquo;MoF&rdquo;) and the State Administration of Taxation (&ldquo;SAT&rdquo;) on the Pilot Program, modern service industries,
	which include industries of research, development and technological services, information technology services, cultural innovation
	services, logistics support, lease of corporeal properties, attestation and consulting services, are subject to VAT. Accordingly,
	most of our subsidiaries and consolidated affiliated entities were in the Pilot Program and subject to VAT at a rate of 6% or 3%.
	According to the Circular on Comprehensively Promoting the Pilot Program of the Collection of VAT in Lieu of Business Tax jointly
	promulgated by SAT and MoF on March 23, 2016, the Pilot Program was promoted nationwide and in all industries effective from May
	1, 2016. Hence, all of our PRC subsidiaries and consolidated affiliated entities have been subject to VAT at a rate of 6% or 3%
	since May 2016. The VAT payable of our PRC subsidiaries and consolidated affiliated entities is the net balance of the output VAT
	for the period after crediting the input VAT for the period. Therefore, the amount of VAT payable does not result directly from
	output VAT generated from taxable services provided. As such, revenues are presented net of VAT in the statement of comprehensive
	income. Our PRC subsidiaries and consolidated affiliated entities which were not subject to VAT before the Pilot Program were subject
	to business taxes at a rate of 5%. Business taxes and related surcharges were deducted from gross revenues to arrive at net revenues
	in our consolidated statements of comprehensive income.

	In addition, our direct and indirect PRC
	subsidiaries and our consolidated affiliated entities are subject to PRC enterprise income tax on their taxable income in accordance
	with the relevant PRC income tax laws. Until January 1, 2008, Chinese companies were generally subject to PRC enterprise income
	tax at a statutory rate of 33%. On January 1, 2008, the EIT Law in China took effect and applies a uniform 25% enterprise income
	tax rate to both foreign-invested enterprises and domestic enterprises, except where a special preferential rate applies. Under
	the EIT Law, entities established before March 16, 2007 that enjoyed a favorable income tax rate of less than 25% under the previous
	income tax laws and rules are provided with a five-year transitional period to gradually change their rates to 25%.

	In April 2006, our subsidiary, Zhilian Wangpin
	was designated as an HNTE, and was subject to a 15% preferential tax rate as long as it maintained the required qualification,
	which was subject to review every two years according to then applicable laws and regulations. Upon the expiration of its HNTE
	qualification in 2008, the tax rate applicable to Zhilian Wangpin increased from 15% to 25%. Beijing Wangpin received HNTE qualification
	approval from the relevant government authorities in November 2011 and filed its HNTE status with local tax bureau in March 2012,
	upon which Beijing Wangpin was entitled to enjoy the preferential tax rate of 15% from calendar year 2011 to calendar year 2013.
	Such HNTE qualification of Beijing Wangpin was renewed in 2014 in accordance with the certificate valid until July, 2017 and Beijing
	Wangpin was entitled to continue enjoying the preferential tax rate of 15% in the calendar years 2014 and 2015, and is continuing
	to enjoy the preferential tax rate in 2016. The income tax expense of Beijing Wangpin was accrued and paid at a rate of 15% for

	Prior to the year ended June 30, 2013, we
	intended to reinvest all undistributed earnings in our PRC subsidiaries and, therefore, no withholding tax was accrued. During
	the year ended June 30, 2013, as we entered into three bank loans, it became apparent that the undistributed earnings of our PRC
	subsidiaries would be remitted outside of China for the repayment of the loans. Therefore, as of June 30, 2013, we accrued RMB24.3
	million of withholding tax on the undistributed earnings. On October 8, 2013, Beijing Wangpin paid out the cash dividend of RMB224.1

	over the service fulfillment period, which normally ranges from one week to one year. Online recruitment services contracts may

	of accounting, as they have value to the customer on a standalone basis and there are no customer-negotiated refunds or return

	based on the relative selling price of each unit of accounting according to the selling price hierarchy established by ASU No.2009-13,
	&ldquo;Revenue Recognition&mdash;Multiple-Deliverable Revenue Arrangements&rdquo; and recognized over the service fulfillment period.
	We use (a) vendor-specific objective evidence of selling price, if it exists, otherwise, (b) third-party evidence of selling price.
	If neither (a) nor (b) exists, we will use (c) the management&rsquo;s best estimate of the selling price for that deliverable.
	Selling price is generally determined by vendor specific objective evidence, which is the price charged for a deliverable when
	it is sold on a standalone basis. For all the periods presented, the service fulfillment period for the separate units of accounting
	within the multiple-element arrangement is the same. Therefore, the allocation between the separate units of accounting for online

	Goodwill is not depreciated or amortized
	but we test for impairment at the reporting unit level on an annual basis every June 30, and in between annual tests when an event
	occurs or circumstances change that could indicate that the asset might be impaired. Commencing September 2011, in accordance with
	the FASB revised guidance on &ldquo;Testing of Goodwill for Impairment,&rdquo; a company first has the option to assess qualitative
	factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount.
	If the company decides, as a result of its qualitative assessment, that it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of a reporting
	unit is less than its carrying amount, the quantitative impairment test is mandatory. Otherwise, no further testing is required.
	The quantitative impairment test consists of a comparison of the fair value of each reporting unit with its carrying amount, including
	goodwill. If the carrying amount of each reporting unit exceeds its fair value, we will record an impairment charge equal to the
	difference between the implied fair value of the reporting unit&rsquo;s goodwill and the carrying amount of goodwill. Application
	of a goodwill impairment test requires our significant judgment, including the identification of reporting units, assigning assets
	and liabilities to reporting units, assigning goodwill to reporting units, and determining the fair value of each reporting unit.
	The judgment in estimating the fair value of reporting units includes estimating future cash flows, determining appropriate discount
	rates and making other assumptions. Changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair
	value for each reporting unit.

	regulations and are legally enforceable. However, uncertainties in the PRC legal system could limit our ability to enforce these
	contractual arrangements. If the corporate structure and contractual arrangements through which we conduct our business in China
	are found to be in violation of any existing or future PRC regulations, the relevant PRC regulatory authorities could revoke or

	or require us to alter the corporate structure or restrict or prohibit our ability to finance the consolidated affiliated entities&rsquo;

	affect our ability to exercise effective control over the consolidated affiliated entities, receive substantially all of the economic

	. Our online recruitment services revenues increased by 22.3% from RMB1,069.4 million
	for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2015 to RMB1,307.6 million (US$196.8 million) for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016. This
	increase was primarily attributable to growth in the number of unique customers using our online recruitment services. We served
	509,813 unique customers for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016, compared with 418,423 for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2015.
	The increase in unique customers was primarily due to our increased efforts to acquire and retain customers with our strategic
	focus on continued geographic expansion and improvement of customer services. Online recruitment services revenues accounted for
	82.9% and 84.8% of our total revenues in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2015 and the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016, respectively.

	Other Services Revenues.
</I>
	Our other services revenues, including campus recruitment, assessment and other human resources
	related services revenues, increased by 6.7% from RMB220.6 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2015 to RMB235.3 million
	(US$35.4 million) for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016. This increase was driven primarily by an increase in our assessment
	services revenues, partially offset by a decrease in campus recruitment service revenues. The increase in our assessment services
	was due to the increased demand for assessment services and our refined product offerings for key industries. The decrease in campus
	recruitment service revenues was due to decreasing demand and intensified competition in campus recruitment in the fiscal year
	ended June 30, 2016. Other services revenues accounted for 17.1% and 15.2% of our total revenues in the fiscal year ended June
	30, 2015 and the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016, respectively.

	Business Tax and Related Surcharges
</I>
	.
	Our business tax and related surcharges increased by 8.4% from RMB18.6 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2015 to RMB20.2
	million (US$3.0 million) for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016. Effective on January 1, 2012, the PRC Ministry of Finance and
	the State Administration of Taxation launched the VAT pilot program for certain industries in certain regions. Accordingly, some
	of our subsidiaries and consolidated affiliated entities were included in the pilot program and were subject to VAT instead of
	business tax from September 2012. The VAT payable by these subsidiaries and consolidated affiliated entities is the net balance
	of the output VAT after deducting the input VAT for the period. Hence, the amount of VAT payable does not result directly from
	output VAT generated from taxable services provided. As such, the net presentation of revenues subject to VAT is adopted. Effective
	on May 1, 2016, the pilot program of the collection of VAT in lieu of business tax was promoted nationwide in the PRC in a comprehensive
	manner and all taxpayers of business tax engaged in the building industry, the real estate industry, the financial industry and
	the modern service industry were included in the scope of the pilot program with regard to payment of VAT instead of business tax.
	See &ldquo;Item 5.A. Operating Results&mdash;Taxation &mdash; PRC.&rdquo; As a result, our average effective business and related
	tax rates decreased from 1.5% for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2015 to 1.3% for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016 as more subsidiaries
	and consolidated affiliated entities were subject to VAT for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016.

	due to our increased efforts to acquire and retain customers with our strategic focus on continued geographic expansion and improvement
	of customer services. Average revenue per unique customer decreased by 2.9% for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2015, compared
	to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2014 due to an increase in new unique customers, which usually purchase lower-priced services

	year ended June 30, 2014 to 20.0% for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2015, primarily because our net revenues increased at a faster

	year ended June 30, 2014. The decrease in effective tax rate was attributable to an increase in tax credits relating to research
	and development expenditures and a decrease in non-deductible share-based compensation expenses incurred in the fiscal year ended
	June 30, 2015. As we planned to use part of the proceeds received from IPO to repay the existing loans, and we intend to reinvest
	all the undistributed earnings of our joint venture and PRC subsidiaries, no withholding tax related to income from our joint venture
	and PRC subsidiaries is expected to be incurred in the foreseeable future. Accordingly, no income tax was accrued on the undistributed

	expenses, real estate leasing expenses, travel expenses and office operating expenses may increase as a result of higher inflation.
	Additionally, because a substantial portion of our assets consists of cash and cash equivalents, high inflation could significantly

	Prior to our IPO, we financed our operations

	As of the date of this annual report, we have no intention to cause our subsidiaries and consolidated affiliated entities to declare

	operation in China. However, in the future, we may rely on dividends and other distributions paid by our PRC subsidiaries for our

	PRC laws and regulations, our PRC subsidiaries such as Zhilian Wangpin and Beijing Wangpin may pay dividends only out of their
	accumulated profits as determined in accordance with PRC accounting standards and regulations. In addition, our PRC subsidiaries
	are required to set aside at least 10% of their accumulated after-tax profits each year, if any, to fund a statutory reserve fund,
	until the aggregate amount of such fund reaches 50% of their respective registered capital. At their discretion, our PRC subsidiaries
	may allocate a portion of their after-tax profits based on PRC accounting standards to staff welfare and bonus funds. These reserve
	funds and staff welfare and bonus funds are not distributable as cash dividends. Furthermore, cash transfers from our PRC subsidiaries
	and consolidated affiliated entities to our subsidiaries outside of China are subject to PRC government control of currency conversion.
	Restrictions on the availability of foreign currency may affect the ability of our PRC subsidiaries and consolidated affiliated

	are prohibited from using Renminbi converted from the proceeds of our initial public offering and the concurrent private placement
	to establish new subsidiaries or acquire an equity interest in other entities in China because their business licenses do not specifically
	authorize equity investments. As a result, if our existing cash is insufficient to meet our requirements, we may sell additional

	We are a holding company with no material

	and indirect dividends paid by our subsidiaries and consolidated affiliated entities. If any of our subsidiaries or consolidated
	affiliated entities or any newly formed subsidiaries or consolidated affiliated entities incur debt on their own behalf in the
	future, the instruments governing their debt may restrict their ability to pay dividends to us. In addition, our PRC subsidiaries
	and consolidated entities are permitted to pay dividends only out of their respective retained earnings, if any, as determined
	in accordance with PRC accounting standards and regulations. Under PRC law, our PRC subsidiaries consolidated affiliated entities
	and their subsidiaries, except for our joint venture, are required to set aside a portion of their respective after-tax profits
	each year to fund a statutory reserve. Our PRC subsidiaries and consolidated entities may also set aside a portion of their respective
	after-tax profits to fund the employee welfare fund at the discretion of the board of directors or the enterprise itself. Although
	the statutory reserves can be used, among other ways, to increase the registered capital and eliminate future losses in excess
	of retained earnings of the respective companies, the reserve funds are not distributable as cash dividends except in the event

	if, among other things, the director (i) becomes bankrupt or makes any arrangement or composition with his creditors; or (ii) dies
	or is found by our company to be or becomes of unsound mind. In addition, until such time as SEEK and its affiliates, in the aggregate,
	possess less than fifty percent of the total voting power of our issued and outstanding voting shares for a period of 180 consecutive
	days, any SEEK Designated Director, as such term is defined in our memorandum and articles of association, may be removed by SEEK

	Hao Liu, Nicolas Andre Casboult, Simon David Rosenberg and Peter Dobie Everingham has been designated by our board of directors

	Under the EIT Law, an enterprise established
	outside of the PRC with &ldquo;de facto management bodies&rdquo; within the PRC is considered a &ldquo;resident enterprise,&rdquo;
	meaning it can be treated in a manner similar to a Chinese enterprise for PRC Enterprise Income Tax purposes, i.e., it is required
	to pay enterprise income tax on income derived from sources inside and outside China, although the dividends paid to one resident
	enterprise from another may qualify as &ldquo;tax-exempt income.&rdquo; The implementation regulations of the EIT Law define a
	&ldquo;de facto management body&rdquo; as a body that has substantial and overall management and control over the manufacturing
	and business operations, personnel and human resources, finances and properties of an enterprise, and provides that if the foreign
	enterprise is deemed to be a PRC resident enterprise, dividends and other income obtained by the shareholder from the deemed PRC
	resident enterprise will be considered PRC-source income and subject to PRC withholding tax, when paid to non-PRC shareholders,
	which may be further reduced depending on provision in the double taxation agreement between China and the relevant countries.
	The Circular specifies that certain foreign enterprises controlled by a PRC company or a PRC company group will be classified as
	PRC &ldquo;resident enterprises&rdquo; if the following requirements are satisfied: (i) the senior management and core management
	departments in charge of its daily operations function are mainly in the PRC; (ii) its financial and human resources decisions
	are subject to determination or approval by persons or bodies in the PRC; (iii) its major assets, accounting books, company seals,
	and minutes and files of its board and shareholders&rsquo; meetings are located or kept in the PRC; and (iv) at least half of the
	enterprise&rsquo;s directors with voting rights or senior management reside in the PRC. Although the Circular only applies to offshore
	enterprises controlled by PRC enterprises and not those controlled by PRC individuals or by foreign individuals or enterprises,
	the determining criteria set forth in the Circular may reflect the State Administration of Taxation&rsquo;s general position on
	how the &ldquo;de facto management body&rdquo; test should be applied in determining the tax resident status of offshore enterprises,
	regardless of whether they are controlled by PRC enterprises or PRC individuals.

	We do not believe that Zhaopin Limited is
	a PRC resident enterprise because it does not meet all of the conditions above. Zhaopin Limited is a company incorporated outside

	outside of the PRC. In addition, we are not aware of any offshore holding companies with similar corporate structures to ours that
	have been deemed to be PRC &ldquo;resident enterprises&rdquo; by the PRC tax authorities. Therefore, we do not believe that Zhaopin
	Limited should be treated as a &ldquo;resident enterprise&rdquo; for PRC tax purposes. However, if the PRC tax authorities determine
	we are a PRC resident enterprise for PRC Enterprise Income Tax purposes, we may be required to withhold a 10% withholding tax from
	dividends we pay to our non-PRC resident enterprise shareholders, including the holders of our ADSs. In addition, non-PRC resident
	enterprise shareholders may be subject to a 10% PRC tax on gains realized on the sale or other disposition of ADSs or ordinary
	shares if such income is treated as sourced from within the PRC. Further, individual holders of ADSs or ordinary shares may be
	subject to PRC individual income tax on such dividends and gains at a rate of 20%. It is unclear whether our non-PRC shareholders
	would be able to claim the benefits of any tax treaties between their tax residence and the PRC in the event we are treated as
	a PRC resident enterprise.

	Pursuant to SAT - Circular 698, issued by
	the State Administration of Taxation on December 10, 2009, where a non-PRC resident enterprise transfers the equity interests of
	a PRC resident enterprise indirectly by disposing of the equity interests of an overseas holding company, or an &ldquo;Indirect
	Transfer,&rdquo; and such overseas holding company is located in a tax jurisdiction that: (i) has an effective tax rate less than
	12.5% or (ii) does not tax foreign income of its residents, the non-PRC resident enterprise that is the transferor is required
	to report this Indirect Transfer to the competent tax authority. The PRC tax authority will examine the true nature of the Indirect
	Transfer using a &ldquo;substance over form&rdquo; principle, and if the tax authority concludes that the non-PRC resident enterprise
	has adopted an &ldquo;abusive arrangement&rdquo; in order to avoid PRC tax, it may disregard the existence of the overseas holding
	company and re-characterize the Indirect Transfer and as a result, gains derived from such Indirect Transfer may be subject to
	PRC tax at a rate of up to 10%. SAT Circular 698 also provides that, where a non-PRC resident enterprise transfers its equity interests
	in a PRC resident enterprise to its related parties at a price which does not comply with the arm&rsquo;s length principle and
	results in reduction of taxable income, the competent tax authority has the power to make a reasonable adjustment to the taxable
	income of the transaction.

	On February 3, 2015, the SAT issued Notice
	7 to supersede the existing tax rules in relation to Indirect Transfers, while the other provisions of SAT Circular 698 remain
	in force. Notice 7 introduces a new tax regime that is significantly different from that under SAT Circular 698. Notice 7 extends
	its tax jurisdiction to capture not only Indirect Transfers as set forth under SAT Circular 698 but also transactions involving
	transfer of real property in China and the assets of an &ldquo;establishment or place&rdquo; situated in China, of a non-PRC resident
	enterprise through the offshore transfer of a foreign intermediate holding company. Notice 7 also interprets the term &ldquo;transfer
	of the equity interest in a foreign intermediate holding company&rdquo; broadly. In addition, Notice 7 provides clearer criteria
	than SAT Circular 698 on how to assess reasonable commercial purposes and introduces safe harbor scenarios applicable to internal
	group restructurings. However, it also raises challenges for both the foreign transferor and transferee of the Indirect Transfer
	as they are required to make a self-assessment of whether the transaction should be subject to PRC tax and to file or withhold
	the PRC tax accordingly.

	There is uncertainty as to the application
	of SAT Circular 698 and Notice 7. Where non-resident investors were involved in our private equity financing, if such transactions
	were determined by the tax authorities to lack reasonable commercial purpose, we and our non-resident investors may become at risk
	of being taxed under SAT Circular 698 and Notice 7 and may be required to expend valuable resources to comply with SAT Circular
	698 and Notice 7 or to establish that we should not be taxed under SAT Circular 698 and Notice 7, which may cause us to incur additional
	costs and may have a negative impact on the value of your investment in us. The PRC tax authorities have discretion under SAT Circular
	698 or Notice 7 to make adjustments to the taxable capital gains based on the difference between the fair value of the equity interests
	transferred and the cost of investment. Although Notice 7 also contains an exemption for transfers of publicly traded stock in
	a PRC resident enterprise, we do not believe Zhaopin Limited is a PRC resident enterprise and such exemption may not be applicable
	to the transfer of our ordinary shares or ADSs. If we are regarded as a non-PRC resident enterprise, PRC tax authorities may deem
	any future transfer of our ordinary shares or ADSs by our shareholders or holders of ADSs to be subject to these regulations, which
	may subject such shareholders or holders of ADSs to additional reporting obligations or tax burdens. If such shareholders or holders
	of ADSs fail to comply with these circulars, the PRC tax authorities may take actions, including requesting us to assist in their
	investigations, which could have a negative impact on our business operations.

	As a Cayman Islands company listed on the

	requirement and the nominating and corporate governance committee requirement under the NYSE rules. As a result, you will not be
	provided with the benefits of all the corporate governance requirements of the NYSE. See &ldquo;Item 3.D. Key Information&mdash;Risk

	In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated

	cash flows present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Zhaopin Limited (&ldquo;the Company&rdquo;)and its
	subsidiaries at June 30, 2016 and 2015, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in
	the period ended June 30, 2016 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. These
	financial statements are the responsibility of the Company&rsquo;s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
	financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits of these statements in accordance with the standards of the Public
	Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
	assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis,
	evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant
	estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
	reasonable basis for our opinion.

	Goodwill is not depreciated or amortized but
	is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level on an annual basis every June 30, and in between annual tests when an event
	occurs or circumstances change that could indicate that the asset might be impaired. Commencing September 2011, in accordance with
	the FASB revised guidance on &ldquo;Testing of Goodwill for Impairment,&rdquo; a company first has the option to assess qualitative
	factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount.
	If the company decides, as a result of its qualitative assessment, that it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of a reporting
	unit is less than its carrying amount, the quantitative impairment test is mandatory. Otherwise, no further testing is required.
	The quantitative impairment test consists of a comparison of the fair value of each reporting unit with its carrying amount, including
	goodwill. If the carrying amount of each reporting unit exceeds its fair value, an impairment charge equal to the difference between
	the implied fair value of the reporting unit&rsquo;s goodwill and the carrying amount of goodwill will be recorded. Application
	of a goodwill impairment test requires significant management judgment, including the identification of reporting units, assigning
	assets and liabilities to reporting units, assigning goodwill to reporting units, and determining the fair value of each reporting
	unit.

	Online Recruitment Services contracts may consist
	of multiple deliverables in the arrangement such as those services described above. Each deliverable is a separate unit of accounting,
	as they have value to the customer on a standalone basis and there are no customer-negotiated refunds or return rights for the
	delivered items. Arrangement consideration is allocated to each unit of accounting at the inception of the arrangement based on
	the relative selling price of each unit of accounting according to the selling price hierarchy established by ASU No.2009-13, &ldquo;Revenue
	Recognition&mdash;Multiple-Deliverable Revenue Arrangements&rdquo; and recognized over the service fulfillment period. The Company
	uses (a) vendor-specific objective evidence of selling price, if it exists, otherwise, (b) third-party evidence of selling price.
	If neither (a) nor (b) exists, the Company will use (c) the management&rsquo;s best estimate of the selling price for that deliverable.
	Selling price is generally determined by vendor specific objective evidence, which is the price charged for a deliverable when
	it is sold on a standalone basis. For all the periods presented, the service fulfillment period for the separate units of accounting
	within the multiple-element arrangement is the same. Therefore, the allocation between the separate units of accounting for online
	recruitment services does not have a material impact on the Company&rsquo;s consolidated financial statements.

	Effective January 1, 2012, the PRC Ministry
	of Finance and the State Administration of Taxation launched the Value Added Tax (&ldquo;VAT&rdquo;) Pilot Program (the &ldquo;Pilot
	Program&rdquo;) for certain industries in certain regions. According to the implementation circulars released by the Ministry of
	Finance (&ldquo;MoF&rdquo;) and the State Administration of Taxation (&ldquo;SAT&rdquo;) on the Pilot Program, the &ldquo;Modern
	Service Industries&rdquo; including research, development and technological services, information technology services, cultural
	innovation services, logistics support, lease of corporeal properties, attestation and consulting services, are subject to VAT.
	Accordingly, most of the Company&rsquo;s subsidiaries and VIEs were in the Pilot Program and subject to VAT at a rate of 6% or
	3%. According to the Circular on Comprehensively Promoting the Pilot Program of the Collection of VAT in Lieu of Business Tax jointly
	promulgated by SAT and MoF on March 23, 2016, effective from May 1, 2016, the Pilot Program was promoted nationwide and in all
	industries. Hence, all of the Company&rsquo;s PRC subsidiaries and VIEs are subject to VAT at a rate of 6% or 3% since May 2016.
	The VAT payable of the Company&rsquo;s subsidiaries and VIEs is the net balance of the output VAT for the period after crediting
	the input VAT for the period. Therefore, the amount of VAT payable does not result directly from output VAT generated from taxable
	services provided. As such, revenues are presented net of VAT in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income. The Company&rsquo;s
	PRC subsidiaries and VIEs which were not subject to VAT before the Pilot Program were subject to business taxes at a rate of 5%.
	Business taxes and related surcharges were deducted from gross revenues to arrive at net revenues in the Group&rsquo;s consolidated
	statements of comprehensive income.

	Basic net income per share is computed by dividing
	net income attributable to holders of ordinary shares by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the
	period using the two-class method. Under the two-class method, net income is allocated between ordinary shares and other participating
	securities based on their participating rights, which provide the holders of participating securities the ability to participate
	in all dividends declared with the holders of ordinary shares on a one-to-one per-share basis in all dividend declared, as if all
	undistributed earnings for the period were distributed. Diluted net income per share is calculated by dividing net income attributable
	to ordinary shareholders as adjusted for the effect of income allocation to holders of participating preferred shares, if any,
	by the weighted average number of ordinary and dilutive ordinary equivalent shares outstanding during the period. Ordinary equivalent
	shares consist of shares issuable upon the exercise of share options (using the treasury stock method) and the conversion of the
	convertible preferred shares (using the if-converted method). Ordinary equivalent shares are not included in the denominator of
	the diluted net income per share calculation when inclusion of such shares would be anti-dilutive, such as in a period in which
	a net loss is recorded.

	Derivative financial instruments are initially
	recognized on the date a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently measured at fair value. The method of recognizing
	the gain or loss resulting from the derivative instrument depends on whether the derivative is designated as a hedging instrument.
	The Company entered into two foreign exchange rate forward contracts and one interest rate swap contract in July 2013 and a cross
	currency interest rate swap contract in January 2015. These instruments are marked-to-market at each period-end with the associated
	changes in fair value recognized in the line item &ldquo;Other income, net&rdquo; in the consolidated statements of comprehensive
	income and &ldquo;Accrued expenses and other liabilities&rdquo; or &ldquo;Prepayments and other current assets&rdquo; in the consolidated
	balance sheets. These instruments are used for risk management purposes only and not for other speculative or trading purposes
	(Note 4(b) (c)). The cash flows of derivative financial instruments are classified in the same category as the cash flows from
	the items subject to the economic hedging relationships. As these instruments are related to economic hedges on the Company&rsquo;s
	bank loans, the cash flows are classified as financing activities. The Company did not designate any derivatives as hedging instruments
	as of June 30, 2015 and 2016.

	In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09,
	&ldquo;Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)&rdquo;. This guidance supersedes current guidance on revenue recognition
	in Topic 605, &ldquo;Revenue Recognition&rdquo;. This guidance was issued to clarify the principles for recognizing revenue and
	developing a common revenue standard for U.S. GAAP and International Financial Reporting Standards. In addition, there are disclosure
	requirements related to the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue recognition. This guidance will be effective for
	annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim reporting periods. In August 2015, the FASB issued
	ASU No.2015-14. This guidance deferred the effective date of ASU No.2014-09 for all entities by one year, and will be required
	to be applied either retrospectively or by modified retrospective approach. Early adoption is permitted only for annual reporting
	periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim reporting periods within that reporting period, therefore, this guidance
	is applicable to the Company&rsquo;s 2019 fiscal year. In March, April and May 2016, the FASB issued additional revenue recognition
	guidance in ASU No. 2016-08, ASU No. 2016-10, ASU No. 2016-11 and ASU No. 2016-12. All four of these standards provide implementation
	guidance and clarifications of ASU 2014-09, &ldquo;Revenue from Contracts with Customers.&rdquo; ASU No. 2016-08 clarifies the
	implementation guidance on principal versus agent considerations, ASU No. 2016-10 provides additional guidance on identifying performance
	obligations and licensing, ASU No. 2016-11 rescinds SEC guidance based on the previous revenue recognition standards and ASU No.
	2016-12 relates to narrow-scope improvements and practical expedients. All of these amendments are effective for public entities
	for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim reporting periods therein. The Company is currently
	evaluating the impact of the adoption of this guidance to the Company&rsquo;s consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.

	The majority of the Group&rsquo;s operating
	transactions are generally denominated in RMB and a significant portion of the Group&rsquo;s assets and liabilities are denominated
	in RMB. RMB is not freely convertible into foreign currencies. The value of the RMB is affected by changes in central government
	policies and international economic and political developments. In the PRC, certain foreign exchange transactions are required
	by law to be transacted only by authorized financial institutions at exchange rates set by the People&rsquo;s Bank of China (&ldquo;PBOC&rdquo;).
	Remittances in currencies other than RMB by companies in China must be processed through PBOC or other PRC foreign exchange regulatory
	bodies and requires certain supporting documentation in order to affect the remittance.

	The Chinese market in which the Group operates
	exposes the Group to certain macro-economic and regulatory risks and uncertainties. These uncertainties extend to the ability of
	the Group to provide online advertising, mobile and internet related services through contractual arrangements in the PRC since
	these industries remain highly regulated. The Chinese government may issue from time to time new laws or new interpretations on
	existing laws to regulate this industry. Regulatory risk also encompasses the interpretation by the tax authorities of current
	tax laws, the status of properties leased for the Group&rsquo;s operations and the Group&rsquo;s corporate structure and scope
	of operations in the PRC, which could be subject to further restrictions resulting in limitations on the Group&rsquo;s ability
	to conduct business in the PRC. The PRC government may also require the Group to restructure its operations entirely if it finds
	that the Group&rsquo;s contractual arrangements do not comply with applicable laws and regulations. It is unclear how a restructuring
	could impact the Group&rsquo;s business and operating results, as the PRC government has not yet found any such contractual arrangements
	to be in noncompliance. However, any such restructuring may cause significant disruption to the Group&rsquo;s business operations.

	The EIT Law also provides that an enterprise
	established under the laws of foreign countries or regions but whose &ldquo;de facto management body&rdquo; is located in the PRC
	be treated as a resident enterprise for PRC tax purposes and consequently be subject to PRC income taxes at the rate of 25% for
	its global income. The Implementing Rules of the EIT Law merely define the location of the &ldquo;de facto management body&rdquo;
	as &ldquo;the place where the exercising, in substance, of the overall management and control of the production and business operation,
	personnel, accounting, properties, etc., of a non-PRC company is located.&rdquo; Based on a review of surrounding facts and circumstances,
	the Group does not believe that it is likely that its operations outside of the PRC should be considered a resident enterprise
	for PRC tax purposes. However, due to limited guidance and implementation history the EIT Law, should the Company be treated as
	a resident enterprise for PRC tax purposes, the Company will be subject to PRC tax on worldwide income at a statutory tax rate
	of 25% retroactive to January 1, 2008.

	A valuation allowance is provided on the deferred
	tax assets to the extent that management believes that it is more likely than not that such deferred tax assets will not be utilized
	in the foreseeable future. In making such determination, the Group considers various factors including future taxable income exclusive
	of reversing temporary differences and carryforwards. For the year ended June 30, 2016, some valuation allowance was reversed when
	certain subsidiaries and VIEs generated sufficient taxable income to utilize the deferred tax assets. Valuation allowances have
	been maintained for those entities where future losses are still expected to occur and management estimated that it is more likely
	than not that the deferred tax assets will not be utilized. If future events prevent the Group from realizing some or all of its
	deferred tax assets, an adjustment to the valuation allowances will be recorded when such events occur.

	Under the EIT Law, dividends, interests, rent,
	royalties and gains on transfers of property payable by a foreign-invested enterprise in the PRC to its foreign investor who is
	a non-resident enterprise will be subject to withholding tax of 10%, unless such non-resident enterprise&rsquo;s jurisdiction of
	incorporation has a tax treaty with the PRC that provides for a reduced rate of withholding taxes. The withholding tax imposed
	on the dividend income received from the Company&rsquo;s PRC subsidiaries and VIEs will reduce the Company&rsquo;s net income.
	On February 22, 2008, the Ministry of Finance and State Tax Bureau jointly issued a circular which stated that for foreign invested
	enterprises, all profits accumulated up to December 31, 2007 are exempted from withholding taxes when they are distributed to foreign

	Prior to the year ended June 30, 2013, the
	Company intended to reinvest all undistributed earnings in PRC subsidiaries, therefore, no withholding tax was accrued. During
	the year ended June 30, 2013, as the Company entered into three bank loans, it became apparent that the undistributed earnings
	of the Company&rsquo;s PRC subsidiaries would be remitted outside of China for the repayment of the loans. Therefore, as of June
	30, 2013, the Company accrued RMB24,283 of withholding tax on the undistributed earnings. On October 8, 2013, Beijing Wangpin paid
	out the cash dividend of RMB224,100, with RMB201,690 paid to and received by the Company and RMB22,410 was paid to local Tax Bureau
	as withholding tax associated with this distribution plan.

	As the Company successfully completed the IPO
	and the CPP in June 2014 (see Note 15), the Company plans to use part of the proceeds received from issuance of its equity to repay
	the existing loans rather than relying on dividend distribution from its PRC subsidiaries. The Company intends to indefinitely
	reinvest all the undistributed earnings of the Company&rsquo;s PRC subsidiaries, and does not plan to have any of its PRC subsidiaries
	to distribute any dividend; therefore no withholding tax is expected to be incurred in the foreseeable future. Accordingly, no
	income tax is accrued on the undistributed earnings of the Company&rsquo;s PRC subsidiaries as of June 30, 2016. The unrecognized
	deferred tax liability on the undistributed earnings of the Company&rsquo;s PRC subsidiaries is RMB69,678

	The fair value of each award is estimated on
	each grant date using the binomial option-pricing model which uses the assumptions presented below. Expected volatilities are based
	on the average volatility of comparable companies in the online human resources industry with the time period commensurate with
	the expected time period of the options granted. The Company uses historical data to estimate option exercise and employment termination
	rate within the pricing formula. The contractual life of the option is 5 to 10 years. The risk-free rate for periods within the
	contractual life of the options are based on the yield of maturity of China government bonds denominated in the U.S. dollars at
	the option valuation date. On March 7, 2014, the Company declared the distribution of dividends in the amount of US$24,000. The

	Pursuant to the PRC Regulations on the Administration

	license. As of June 30, 2016, three branches of Beijing Wangpin have been conducting human resources related services without the
	human resources service license and may be ordered to cease operations and a fine of up to RMB30 per entity may be imposed, by
	local human resources bureaus. If these entities were ordered to cease operations, this would have a material adverse impact on
	the operations of the Group. For periods presented, the Group has not been subject to any fines nor has any entity been ordered
	to cease operations. The Group is in the process of remediating such non-compliance and has not provided for any contingent liabilities

	For the year ended June 30, 2013, the Company
	entered into loan agreements (collectively, the &ldquo;2013 Facilities&rdquo;) with offshore branches of certain banks for the
	purpose of repurchasing preferred shares from Macquarie. In 2014 and 2015, the Company entered into new bank loan facilities (collectively,
	the &ldquo;2014 Facilities&rdquo; and &ldquo;2015 Facility&rdquo;) to refinance the 2013 and 2014 bank loan facilities. All of
	the 2013 Facilities, 2014 Facilities and the 2015 Facility were collateralized by an equivalent or greater amount of RMB time deposits
	by Beijing Wangpin in the onshore branches of such banks. In addition, certain amount of cash was deposited in offshore banks as
	an interest reserve to the bank loans. As of June 30, 2016, the total balance of bank loans was RMB172,411, carrying a floating
	rate of interest based on LIBOR. The bank loans from the offshore branches of the lending banks are classified as current portion
	of long-term bank loans or long-term bank loans based on their payment terms.

	The Company estimated the fair value of restricted
	cash using the discounted cash flow methodology, and restricted cash are valued based on the prevailing interest rates in the market.
	The Company classifies the valuation techniques that use the prevailing interest rates input as Level 2 of fair value measurements.
	This is because there are generally no quoted prices in active markets for identical time deposits at the reporting date. Hence,
	in order to determine the fair value, the Company must use observable inputs other than quoted prices in active markets for identical
	assets and liabilities, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in inactive markets, or other inputs that
	are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.

	The Company&rsquo;s cash equivalents are demand
	deposits placed with banks with an original maturity of less than three months. The Company&rsquo;s time deposits placed with banks
	have an original maturity over three months. The Company estimated the fair values of cash equivalents and time deposits using
	the discounted cash flow methodology, and the fair value of cash equivalents and time deposits is determined based on the prevailing
	interest rates in the market, which are also the interest rates as stated in the contracts with the banks. The Company classifies
	the valuation techniques that use the prevailing interest rates input as Level 2 of fair value measurements. This is because there
	generally are no quoted prices in active markets for identical time deposits at the reporting date. Hence, in order to determine
	the fair value, the Company must use observable inputs other than quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities,
	quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in inactive markets, or other inputs that are observable or can be
	corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.

	Relevant PRC laws and regulations permit payments
	of dividends by the subsidiaries and the VIEs incorporated in the PRC only out of their retained earnings, if any, as determined
	in accordance with PRC accounting standards and regulations. In addition, each of the Company&rsquo;s subsidiaries and VIEs is
	required to annually appropriate 10% of net after-tax income to the statutory general reserve fund (Note 3(w)) prior to payment
	of any dividends, unless such reserve funds have reached 50% of its respective registered capital. As a result of these and other
	restrictions under PRC laws and regulations, the subsidiaries and VIEs are restricted in their ability to transfer a portion of
	their net assets to the Company either in the form of dividends, loans or advances of the Group&rsquo;s total consolidated net
	assets. As of June 30, 2016, the total registered capital and statutory reserves of the Company&rsquo;s subsidiaries and VIEs incorporated
	in PRC and subjected to restriction amounted to approximately RMB359,224. Even though the Company currently does not require any
	such dividends, loans or advances from the PRC entities for working capital and other funding purposes, the Company may in the
	future require additional cash resources from them due to changes in business conditions, to fund future acquisitions and development,
	or merely to declare and pay dividends or distributions to its shareholders. Except for the above, there is no other restriction
	on the use of proceeds generated by the Company&rsquo;s subsidiaries and the VIEs to satisfy any obligations of the Company.
