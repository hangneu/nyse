	The success of our business depends primarily
	on the number of students enrolled in our courses and the amount of course fees that our students are willing to pay. Therefore,
	our ability to continue to attract students to enroll in our courses without a significant decrease in course fees is critical
	to the continued success and growth of our business. This in turn will depend on several factors, including our ability to continue
	to develop new programs and enhance or adapt existing programs to respond to changes in market trends, student demands and government
	policies, expand our geographic reach, manage our growth while maintaining consistent and high teaching quality, effectively market
	our programs to a broader base of prospective students, develop additional high-quality educational content and respond effectively
	to competitive pressures. If we are unable to continue to attract students without significantly decreasing course fees to enroll
	in our courses, our revenues may decline, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results

	We believe that market awareness of our

	value of this brand is critical to maintaining and enhancing our competitive advantage. If we are unable to successfully promote
	and market our brand and services, our ability to attract new students could be adversely impacted and, consequently, our financial
	performance could suffer. We mainly rely on word-of-mouth referrals to attract prospective students. We also use integrated marketing
	tools and tactics such as the Internet, wechat, social media, public lectures, outdoor advertising campaigns, co-brand promotions,
	and distribution of marketing materials to promote our brand and service offerings. In order to maintain and increase our brand
	recognition and promote our new service offerings, we have increased our marketing personnel and expenses over the last several
	years. We have also sought to strengthen recognition for our other brands, such as our &ldquo;Haoweilai&rdquo; brand, which is
	the umbrella brand for all our brands, our &ldquo;Zhikang&rdquo; brand, through which we offer personalized premium services, our
	&ldquo;Mobby&rdquo; brand, through which we offer small classes focused on thinking development for young learners, our &ldquo;Lejiale&rdquo;
	brand, through which we offer English subject tutoring services and our &ldquo;Dongxuetang&rdquo; brand, through which we offer
	our Chinese subject tutoring services. After our acquisition of Firstleap Education, we will also enhance and promote the &ldquo;Firstleap&rdquo;
	brand for all-subject tutoring services in English to students aged two to fifteen. A number of factors could prevent us from successfully

	It is therefore common for students to take after-school tutoring classes to improve performance, and the success of our business

	There are continuous changes in high
	school and college entrance exams and college admission standards in China, including the focus of the subjects and questions
	tested, the format of the tests, and the manner in which the tests are administered. These changes require us to continually
	update and enhance our curriculum, course materials and teaching methods. Any inability to track and respond to these changes
	in a timely and cost-effective manner would make our services and products less attractive to students, which may materially
	and adversely affect our reputation and ability to continue to attract students. For example, the Ministry of Education, or
	MoE, promulgated new curriculum standards for primary and secondary schools in China covering 19 subjects, including
	mathematics, Chinese and English, in December 2011. These new curriculum standards took effect in the fall semester of 2012.
	In October 2013, the Beijing Municipal Commission of Education announced plans to change policies relating to college
	entrance examinations, under which changes to the format and content of English exam were to be introduced in the coming
	years. On September 3, 2014, the State Council promulgated the Opinions Related to the Implementation of the Further Reform
	of Examination-Enrollment System to provide further opinions in changing the enrollment system of college entrance
	examination. Since the promulgation of such Opinions by the State Council, there have been 24 provinces, autonomous regions
	or municipalities directly under the central government that have announced to launch their respective new policies related
	to college entrance examinations in accordance with the Opinions aforementioned. These provinces include Tianjin, Beijing,
	Qinghai, Shanghai, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Hainan, Tibet, Ningxia, Guangxi, Guangdong, Gansu, Heilongjiang, Liaoning, Guizhou,
	Hebei, Shandong, Hunan, Sichuan, Jiangxi, Jilin, Shanxi, Chongqing, and Hubei. These new policies generally covers the
	changes of subjects in the entrance examination and the changes of the times of the English examinations in college entrance
	examination. On December 10, 2014, MoE, State Ethic Affairs Commission, the Ministry of Public Security, General
	Administration of Sport and China Association for Science and Technology jointly promulgated the Opinions to Further Reduce
	and Regulate the Subject and Number of Extra Scores in College Entrance Examination, which among other things, provides to
	cancel the extra scores due to the excellent performance of students in the fields of sports, Olympiad competitions, science
	and technology competitions, and morality for college entrance examination as well as the extra scores of students who
	obtains the title of Provincial Excellent Students in their college entrance examination, and also provide further opinions
	in regulating the subject and number of extra scores in college entrance examination. On December 10, 2014, MoE promulgated
	the Opinions of Implementation of the High School Academic Proficiency Test, which requires the high school students to
	participate the High School Academic Proficiency Test and the scores of students obtained in this High School Academic
	Proficiency Test will be provided to the colleges for enrollment in specific ways respectively determined by each college,
	province, region and municipality. We have completed the process of adapting our tutoring programs and materials to these new
	curriculum requirements. However, any failure to respond in a timely and cost-effective manner to such changes will adversely
	impact the marketability of our services and products.

	Regulations and policies which de-emphasize
	scholastic competition achievements in college and high school admissions have had, and may continue to have, an impact on our
	enrollments. Our business in Beijing has been affected by the change in policy on the use of mathematical Olympiad competition
	results for admission to key middle schools. Following the MoE&rsquo;s amendment of its &ldquo;extra credit policy&rdquo; in November
	2010 to limit the number of extra scores Olympiad competition winners may receive for their college entrance examination and in
	compliance with the Implementation Opinions on Standardizing Educational Changes and Adjusting Arbitrary Educational Changes in
	2013, which relate to the admissions processes of high schools, certain local educational authorities promulgated policies limiting
	the role of Olympiad competitions in the admission process of high schools and middle schools. In February 2013, the Beijing Municipal
	Education Commission issued a Notice on Mitigating Schoolwork-Related Stress on Students in Primary and Secondary Schools, which,
	among other things, prohibit public schools from cooperating with or authorizing private training organizations to offer after-school
	tutoring services for the purpose of enrolling students in such public schools. This policy has generally resulted in a decrease
	in the demand for mathematical Olympiad competition courses, which in turn has also affected the enrollments in our mathematics
	classes as well as our personalized premium services business. In addition, the MoE issued the Implementation Opinions on Further
	Improving the Exam-exemption and Nearest Schooling Enrollment Work in Secondary Schools in January 2014 to clarify that local educational
	administrative departments at all levels, public schools and private schools are not allowed to use examinations to select their
	students. Public schools may not use various competitions or examinations as the selection method for enrollment. The general office
	of the MoE issued the Notice on Further Improving the Compulsory School Exam-exemption and Nearest Schooling Enrollment Work in
	Main Cities to the provincial and municipal educational administrative departments in Beijing, Tianjin, Liaoning, Jilin, Heilongjiang,
	Shanghai, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Fujian, Shandong, Hubei, Guangdong, Chongqing, Sichuan, Shanxi, Dalian, Qingdao, Ningbo, Xiamen and
	Shenzhen in January 2014 to further request that all the primary schools and secondary schools in main cities implement this notice
	gradually from now to 2017 and put an end to the entrance examinations and the link between entrance examinations and enrollment.
	These policies were published recently and have not resulted in a decrease in the demand for any of our services so far. However,
	we cannot ensure you that they will not adversely affect the performance of our after-school tutoring business and personalized
	premium services that target students in primary schools.

	Also, education authorities in Yunnan Province
	stopped administering provincial-level high school entrance examinations in 2010. High school admissions in Yunnan Province have
	since then been based on a combination of middle school examination results that have replaced raw scores with letter grades and
	comprehensive evaluations of students&rsquo; aptitude and performance by their middle schools. Yunnan Province also began to prohibit
	subject competitions in primary and secondary schools in November 2009. Although we do not offer after-school tutoring services
	in Yunnan Province, nor do we expect to do so in the near future, it is possible that the local governments in the areas where
	we have operations may adopt similar measures. If we fail to adjust our services to respond to any such material changes, our business
	may be materially and adversely affected. In addition, admission and assessment processes in China constantly undergo changes and
	development in terms of subject and skill focus, question type, examination format and the manner in which processes are used.
	We are therefore required to continually update and improve our curriculum, course materials and our teaching methods. A failure

	Our office space and service and learning
	centers are presently mainly located on leased premises. We purchased 7,582 square meters of building space in Beijing in July
	2011, which we renovated as offices in the fiscal year ended February 28, 2013, and purchased 881 square meters of building space
	in Anhui in May 2016, which we plan to use as learning center. With respect to our leased premises, at the end of each lease term,
	which generally ranges from one to 15 years, we must negotiate an extension of the lease and if we are not able to negotiate an
	extension on terms acceptable to us, we will be forced to move to a different location, or the rent may increase significantly.
	This could disrupt our operations and adversely affect our profitability. All of our leases are subject to renewal at market prices,
	which could result in a substantial rent increase at each time of renewal. We compete with many other businesses for sites in certain
	prime locations and some landlords may have entered into long-term leases with our competitors for these locations. As a result,
	we may not be able to obtain new leases at desirable locations or renew our existing leases on acceptable terms or at all, which
	could adversely affect our business. In addition, a few of our lessors have not been able to provide us with copies of title certificates
	or other evidencing documents to prove that they have authorization to lease the properties to us. We also have not registered
	most of our lease agreements with the relevant PRC governmental authorities as required by relevant PRC law. As of the date of
	this annual report, we are not aware of any actions, claims or investigations threatened against us with respect to the defects
	in our leasehold interests while we are informed that one of our lessors is involved in litigations with respect to the defects
	in its rental right, which to our best knowledge will not have material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and
	results of operations as a whole. We were aware of the defects when we entered into those leases. In many cases, we entered into
	leases upon promises from the lessors that relevant certificates and authorizations would be delivered at a later time, which did
	not eventually materialize. Our business and legal teams followed an internal guideline to identify and assess risks in connection
	with leasing the properties, and a final business decision was made after our analysis of the likely impact of the defects on the
	leasehold interests and the value of the properties to our expansion plan. However, there is no assurance that our decision would
	always lead to the favorable outcome we expected to achieve. If any of our leases are terminated as a result of challenges by third
	parties or government authorities for lack of title certificates or proof of authorization to lease, we do not expect to be subject
	to any fines or penalties but we may be forced to relocate the affected learning centers and incur additional expenses relating
	to such relocation. If we fail to find suitable replacement sites in a timely manner or on terms acceptable to us, our business
	and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.

	The performance and reliability of our websites

	or failure, or a sudden and significant increase in online traffic, could disrupt or slow access to our websites. We cannot assure
	you that we will be able to expand our online infrastructure in a timely and cost-effective manner to meet the increasing demands
	of our students and their parents. In addition, our computer systems store and process important information including, without
	limitation, class schedules, registration information and student data and could be vulnerable to interruptions or malfunctions
	due to events beyond our control, such as natural disasters and technology failures. For instance, we have in the past experienced
	interruptions to our operations due to temporary computer system failures. Although we have a daily backup system that runs on
	different servers for our operating data, we may still lose important student data or suffer disruption to our operations if there
	is a failure of the database system or the backup system. In addition, computer hackers, foreign governments or cyber terrorists
	may attempt to penetrate our network security and our website. Unauthorized access to our proprietary business information or customer
	data may be obtained through break-ins, sabotage, breach of our secure network by an unauthorized party, computer viruses, computer
	denial-of-service attacks, employee theft or misuse, breach of the security of the networks of our third party providers, or other
	misconduct. Because the techniques used by computer programmers who may attempt to penetrate and sabotage our network security
	or our website change frequently and may not be recognized until launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these
	techniques. It is also possible that unauthorized access to customer data may be obtained through inadequate use of security controls
	by customers. We would suffer economic and reputational damages if a technical failure of our systems or a security breach compromises
	student data, including identification or contact information, although there has not been any compromise in the past. Any disruption
	to our computer systems could therefore have a material adverse effect on our on-site operations and ability to retain students
	and increase student enrollments.

	five percent (5%) of the total issued and outstanding shares as of the date of the amended and restated 2010 Share Incentive Plan.

	shares under our share incentive plan previously granted to our employees, directors and consultants are outstanding. As a result
	of these grants and potential future grants under the plan, we have incurred and will continue to incur share-based compensation

	and introduces the principle of &ldquo;actual control&rdquo; in determining whether a company is considered a foreign-invested

	draft law has not taken a position on what actions will be taken with respect to the existing companies with the &ldquo;variable

	We have entered into equity pledge agreements
	with our VIEs and their respective shareholders to guarantee the performance of the obligations of our Consolidated Affiliated
	Entities under the exclusive business cooperation agreements they have entered into with us. In the registration forms submitted
	to the local branch of the State Administration of Industry and Commerce, or the SAIC, for the pledges over the equity interests
	under the equity pledge agreements, the amount of registered equity interests pledged to TAL Beijing, our wholly owned subsidiary,
	was RMB10 million, RMB3 million and RMB2 million for Xueersi Education, Xueersi Network and Xinxin Xiangrong, respectively, which
	represents 100% of their respective registered capital. Pursuant to the equity pledge agreement entered into by and among Lebai
	Information, Lebai Education and its sole shareholder, 100% of the registered capital of Lebai Education has been pledged to Lebai
	Information, our wholly owned subsidiary, while such pledge of the equity interests in Lebai Education has not been registered
	with the local branch of the SAIC. The equity pledge agreements with the shareholders of the VIEs provide that the pledged equity
	interest shall constitute continuing security for any and all of the indebtedness, obligations and liabilities under all of the
	principal service agreements and the scope of pledge shall not be limited by the amount of the registered capital of the VIEs.
	However, it is possible that a PRC court may take the position that the amount listed on the equity pledge registration forms represents
	the full amount of the collateral that has been registered and perfected. If this is the case, the obligations that are supposed
	to be secured in the equity pledge agreements in excess of the amount listed on the equity pledge registration forms could be determined

	Consequently, the assets of our Consolidated Affiliated Entities are not secured on behalf of our wholly owned subsidiary, and
	the amounts owed by our Consolidated Affiliated Entities are not collateralized. As a result, if our Consolidated Affiliated Entities
	fail to pay any amount due to us under, or otherwise breach, the exclusive business service agreements, we will not be able to
	directly seize the assets of our Consolidated Affiliated Entities. If the nominee shareholders of the VIEs do not act in the best

	Affiliated Entities to transfer or encumber the assets of the Consolidated Affiliated Entities without our authorization. In such
	a scenario, we may choose to exercise our option under the call option agreements to demand the shareholders of the VIEs to transfer
	their respective equity interests in the VIEs to a PRC person designated by us, and we may need to resort to litigation in the
	PRC courts to effect such an equity interests transfer and prevent the transfer or encumbrance of the VIEs&rsquo; assets without
	our authorization. However, uncertainties in the PRC legal system could limit our ability to enforce the VIE Contractual Arrangements.
	In the event we are unable to enforce the VIE Contractual Arrangements, we may not be able to have the power to direct the activities

	annual increase in the net assets of the school, if any. A private school that requires reasonable returns must publicly disclose
	such election and additional information required under the regulations. A private school shall consider factors such as the school&rsquo;s
	tuition, ratio of the funds used for education-related activities to the course fees collected, admission standards and educational
	quality when determining the percentage of the school&rsquo;s net income that would be distributed to the investors as reasonable
	returns. However, none of the current PRC laws and regulations provides a formula or guidelines for determining &ldquo;reasonable

	school&rsquo;s ability to operate its education business based on such school&rsquo;s status as one that does or does not require

	Our schools are registered as schools that
	require reasonable returns in some cities and as schools that do not require reasonable returns in others. As of April 30, 2016,
	we had 47 affiliated schools, among which 17 had elected not to require reasonable returns and the remaining 30 had elected to
	require reasonable returns. The respective sponsor of each school will make such election and determine the amounts to be allocated
	to each school&rsquo;s development fund in accordance with PRC laws and regulations. We do not believe that the election to be
	a school that does or does not require reasonable returns will affect amounts that may be distributed to us by means of different
	fee payments such as service fees. As a holding company, we rely on dividends and other distributions from our PRC subsidiaries,
	including TAL Beijing and Lebai Information. TAL Beijing, Lebai Information and their designated affiliates are entitled to receive
	service fees from the schools according to the relevant exclusive business cooperation agreements. We do not believe that TAL Beijing,
	Lebai Information and their designated affiliates&rsquo; right to receive the service fees from the schools will be affected by
	such election, but if our judgment turns out to be incorrect, TAL Beijing, Lebai Information and our other PRC subsidiaries&rsquo;
	ability to make distributions or pay dividends to us may be materially and adversely impacted. If a school elects to be a school
	that does not require reasonable return but in fact pays reasonable return to its sponsor, in extreme cases, PRC government authorities
	have the right to suspend the operations of the relevant school and suspend student enrollment and perhaps even to de-register
	the operating permits of such schools altogether, which may materially and adversely impact our business, financial condition and

	The PRC legal system is a civil law system
	based on written statutes. Unlike the common law system, prior court decisions in a civil law system may be cited for reference
	but have limited precedential value. Since 1979, PRC legislation and regulations have significantly enhanced the protections afforded
	to various forms of foreign investments in China. However, since these laws and regulations are relatively new and the PRC legal
	system continues to rapidly evolve, the interpretations of many laws, regulations and rules are not always consistent, and enforcement
	of these laws, regulations and rules involve uncertainties, which may limit the available legal protections. In addition, the PRC
	administrative and court authorities have significant discretion in interpreting and implementing or enforcing statutory rules
	and contractual terms, and it may be more difficult to predict the outcome of administrative and court proceedings and the level
	of legal protection we may enjoy in China than under some more developed legal systems. These uncertainties may affect our judgment
	on the relevance of legal requirements and our decisions on the measures and actions to be taken to fully comply therewith and
	may affect our ability to enforce our contractual or tort rights. In addition, the regulatory uncertainties may be exploited through
	unmerited legal actions or threats in an attempt to extract payments or benefits from us. Such uncertainties may therefore increase
	our operating expenses and costs, and materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations.

	The MoC published a discussion draft of

	foreign investment in China, namely, the Sino-foreign Equity Joint Venture Enterprise Law, the Sino-foreign Cooperative Joint Venture
	Enterprise Law and the Wholly Foreign-invested Enterprise Law, together with their implementation rules and ancillary regulations.
	The draft Foreign Investment Law embodies an expected PRC regulatory trend to rationalize its foreign investment regulatory regime

	and domestic investments. The MoC has solicited comments on this draft and substantial uncertainties exist with respect to its

	Among other things, the draft Foreign Investment
	Law expands the definition of foreign investment and introduces the principle of &ldquo;actual control&rdquo; in determining whether
	a company is considered a foreign-invested enterprise, or an FIE. The draft Foreign Investment Law specifically provides that entities
	established in China but &ldquo;controlled&rdquo; by foreign investors will be treated as FIEs, whereas an entity set up in a foreign
	jurisdiction would nonetheless be, upon market entry clearance by the MoC, treated as a PRC domestic investor provided that the
	entity is &ldquo;controlled&rdquo; by PRC entities and/or citizens. In this connection, &ldquo;control&rdquo; is broadly defined
	in the draft law to cover the following summarized categories: (i) holding 50% or more of the voting rights or similar equity interest
	of the subject entity; (ii) holding less than 50% of the voting rights or similar equity interest of the subject entity but having
	the power to secure at least 50% of the seats on the board or other equivalent decision making bodies, or having the voting power
	to exert material influence on the board, the shareholders&rsquo; meeting or other equivalent decision making bodies; or (iii)
	having the power to exert decisive influence, via contractual or trust arrangements, over the subject entity&rsquo;s operations,
	financial matters or other key aspects of business operations. Once an entity is determined to be an FIE, and its investment amount
	exceeds certain thresholds or its business operation falls within a &ldquo;negative list,&rdquo; to be separately issued by the
	State Council in the future, market entry clearance by the MoC or its local counterparts will be required. Otherwise, all foreign
	investors may make investments on the same terms as domestic investors without being subject to additional approval from the government
	authorities as mandated by the existing foreign investment legal regime.

	In 2009, the MoE, together with a few other
	PRC government agencies, issued implementation rules on administration of education-related fee collection, which provide, among
	other things, that schools that are part of the compulsory education system are not allowed to charge students additional fees
	for any type of after-school tutoring classes, and that public schools and their teachers, whether or not in cooperation with private
	schools, are prohibited from offering any type of after-school tutoring or training classes for a fee outside the school. Private
	schools, which are not part of the compulsory education system, generally are permitted to offer after-school tutoring services
	pursuant to their private school operating permits issued by the relevant PRC government authorities pursuant to the Law for Promoting
	Private Education and implementation rules promulgated thereunder. However, several provincial government agencies issued notices
	or rules applicable in their respective provinces expressly prohibiting even private schools from offering after-school tutoring
	classes to primary and secondary school students. Among the areas where we offer after-school tutoring services, local governments
	in Shanghai and Tianjin issued notices in 2004 and 2005, respectively, prohibiting private schools from offering after-school tutoring
	services to primary and secondary school students. Nevertheless, we are not aware of any instances in Shanghai or Tianjin where
	the government authorities took actions enforcing the aforementioned notices; nor have we received any notices, warnings or inquiries
	from these government authorities with respect to our tutoring services. In February 2013, the Beijing Municipal Education Commission
	issued a Notice on Reducing Schoolwork-Related Stress on Students in Primary and Secondary Schools, which, among other things,
	strictly prohibits private schools from offering after-school tutoring classes to primary and secondary school students. The aforementioned
	notices do not provide any monetary penalties for violations and thus we are not able to quantify the penalties that we may be
	subject to if we are deemed not to be in compliance with these notices. We are not aware of any imminent risks in connection with
	the aforementioned notices. However, since PRC regulatory authorities have significant discretion in interpreting and implementing
	rules and regulations and that regulatory enforcements can be inconsistent, we cannot assure you that we will not in the future
	be subject to the above mentioned regulations, fined or otherwise penalized by government authorities for offering such classes,

	We are required to obtain and maintain various
	licenses and permits and fulfill registration and filing requirements in order to operate our tutoring service business. For instance,
	a duly approved private school will be granted a private school operating permit, and shall be registered with the Ministry of
	Civil Affairs or its local branches as a privately run non-enterprise institution. In addition, learning centers of schools must
	make filings with the MoE or its local branches. As of February 29, 2016, we had 363 learning centers in operation, of which 241
	learning centers offer Xueersi Peiyou small classes, 41 learnings centers offer Firstleap small classes and five learning centers
	offer Mobby small classes. As of April 30, 2016, 66 learning centers had not completed filing requirements for permits or registrations.
	These 66 learning centers in the aggregate accounted for 7% of our total net revenues for the fiscal year ended February 29, 2016.
	If we fail to comply with applicable legal requirements, we may be subject to fines, confiscation of any gains derived from our
	non-compliant operations or the suspension of our non-compliant operations, which may materially and adversely affect our business

	We are in the process of preparing filings
	and applying for permits for these learning centers but do not expect to complete all such filings and obtain all such permits
	in the near term. We have been taking steps to meet these requirements, but there is no assurance that our efforts will result
	in full compliance given the significant amount of discretion PRC government authorities have in interpreting, implementing and
	enforcing rules and regulations and due to other factors beyond our control. For example, Shenzhen Municipal Education Bureau ceased
	accepting applications for the establishment of new private schools between the year of 2006 and December 7, 2010. While we were
	preparing the application to the Shenzhen educational authorities for the operating permits in Shenzhen, two of our learning centers
	received notices from the local city administrative departments in March 2012 which required us to obtain the operating permits
	before we could continue our business in Shenzhen. We later received the private school operating permit for our school in Shenzhen
	from Shenzhen Municipal Education Bureau in August 2013 and completed the registration with the Shenzhen City Civil Affairs Office
	in November 2013. For the twelve Xueersi Peiyou learning centers operated by our school in Shenzhen, we have completed the required

	In cities other than Beijing, a significant
	portion of our personalized premium services is offered through the subsidiaries of our VIEs, and most of these subsidiaries have
	obtained business licenses from the local branch of the SAIC permitting them to conduct consulting services. However, some of
	the subsidiaries of our VIEs have not obtained business licenses and a few learning centers which engage in personalized premium
	services have not obtained operating permits that meet regulatory requirements. For example, Shanghai local educational authority
	and Shanghai branch of the SAIC published provisional measures in June 2013 regarding the registration and management of for-profit
	educational institutions to provide the conditions and procedures for setting up for-profit private training institutions in the
	form of a company and further clarify that other types of companies shall not carry out educational consulting or one-on-one services.
	These provisional measures became effective on July 20, 2013 and stayed effective until July 19, 2015. However, based on telephone
	inquiries our PRC counsel have made to the Shanghai Municipal education Commission, these provisional measures still apply in
	practice, since no alternative regulation is currently available. We offered personalized premium services in some districts in
	Shanghai through a company with its business license not permitting it to conduct such consulting services and we have not yet
	set up companies in Shanghai to meet regulatory requirements in accordance with the aforementioned rules. In addition, two learning
	centers in Xi&rsquo;an are operated by a subsidiary of a VIE without the scope of &ldquo;educational consulting services&rdquo;
	for the fiscal year ended February 29, 2016, revenues from the personalized premium services of such subsidiaries of our VIEs
	in Shanghai and Xi&rsquo;an contributed approximately 1.6% of our total net revenues.

	We believe that our personalized premium
	services fall within the scope of &ldquo;for-profit training activities&rdquo; and are not &ldquo;educational activities&rdquo;
	that must be under the jurisdiction of the educational authorities and thus offered through schools or educational institutions.
	However, the differences between &ldquo;educational activities,&rdquo; on the one hand, and &ldquo;for-profit training activities&rdquo;
	and &ldquo;educational consulting services,&rdquo; on the other hand, remain unclear under applicable PRC laws and regulations.
	The Law for Promoting Private Education provides that &ldquo;educational activities,&rdquo; which are required to be conducted
	through schools or educational institutions, shall be regulated by the MoE whereas &ldquo;for-profit training activities&rdquo;
	shall be regulated by the SAIC in accordance with separate regulations to be issued by the State Council. To date, the State Council
	has not promulgated any regulations with respect to &ldquo;for-profit training activities.&rdquo; In July 2010, the MoE issued
	the National Guidance on Mid- to Long-term Education Reform and Development, which is the first guidance expressly encouraging
	the applicable PRC government authorities to classify, through implementing rules or regulations, activities as &ldquo;for-profit
	training activities&rdquo; to be conducted only by for-profit entities or &ldquo;non-profit training or educational activities&rdquo;
	to be conducted only by certain schools. However, to date, the SAIC and the MoE have not issued any such rules or regulations,
	and in practice, regulators in different local jurisdictions may still have different views and administrative policies on one-on-one
	tutoring activities. Therefore, we cannot be certain that the relevant government authorities will reach the same conclusion in
	the future as we have that our personalized premium services fall within the scope of &ldquo;for-profit training activities&rdquo;
	and are not &ldquo;educational activities.&rdquo;

	policies adopted by the central banks and financial authorities of some of the world&rsquo;s leading economies, including the United

	10% of their after-tax profit based on PRC accounting standards each year to their statutory surplus reserves until the accumulative

	may allocate a portion of their after-tax profit to their staff welfare and bonus fund at the discretion of their boards of directors.
	Our PRC subsidiaries and Consolidated Affiliated Entities historically have not allocated any of their after-tax profits to staff
	welfare and bonus funds, since there is no legal requirement to do so, but they may nevertheless decide to set aside such funds
	in the future. There is no maximum amount of after-tax profit that a company may contribute to such funds. Moreover, each of our
	affiliated schools is required to allocate certain amount of profits to its development fund for the construction or maintenance
	of school facilities or procurement or upgrade of educational equipment at the end of each fiscal year. See &ldquo;Item 4.B. Information

	Private Education and the Implementation Rules for the Law for Promoting Private Education&rdquo; for a discussion on the requirements
	for private schools to make allocations to school development funds. Any direct or indirect limitation on the ability of our PRC
	subsidiaries to distribute dividends and other distributions to us could materially and adversely limit our ability to make investments

	Renminbi, or SAFE Circular 142, which requires that RMB converted from foreign currency-denominated capital of a foreign-invested
	enterprise may only be used for purposes within the business scope approved by the relevant government authority and may not be
	used to make equity investments in China, unless specifically provided otherwise. Moreover, the approved use of such RMB funds
	may not be changed without approval from the SAFE. RMB funds converted from foreign exchange may not be used to repay loans in
	RMB if the proceeds of such loans have not yet been used. Any violation of SAFE Circular 142 may result in severe penalties, including
	substantial fines. We expect that if we convert the net proceeds from offshore offerings into RMB pursuant to SAFE Circular 142,
	our use of RMB funds will be for purposes within the approved business scope of our PRC subsidiaries. However, we may not be able
	to use such RMB funds to make equity investments in China through our PRC subsidiaries. On March 30, 2015, the SAFE promulgated
	the Notice on Reforming the Management Method relating to Conversion of the Capital Contribution of Foreign Invested Company from
	Foreign Exchange to Renminbi, or SAFE Circular 19. Although SAFE Circular 142 was abolished when SAFE Circular 19 became effective
	on June 1, 2015, the foregoing rules have been retained in SAFE Circular 19. On February 13, 2015, the SAFE promulgated the Notice
	on Further Simplifying and Improving the Policies of Foreign Exchange Administration Applicable to Direct Investment, or SAFE Circular
	13, which was effective on June 1, 2015. Pursuant to SAFE Circular 13, annual foreign exchange inspection of direct investment
	is not required anymore and the registration of existing equity is required. SAFE Circular 13 also grants the authority to banks
	to examine and process foreign exchange registration with respect to both domestic and offshore direct investment.

	The Notice on Issues Relating to the Administration
	of Foreign Exchange in Fund-Raising and Round-Trip Investment Activities of Domestic Residents Conducted via Offshore Special Purpose
	Companies, or SAFE Circular 75, requires PRC residents to register with the relevant local branch of the SAFE before establishing
	or controlling any company outside China, referred to as an offshore special purpose company, for the purpose of raising funds
	from overseas to acquire or exchange the assets of, or acquiring equity interests in, PRC entities held by such PRC residents and
	to update such registration in the event of any significant changes with respect to that offshore company. The SAFE promulgated
	the Circular on Relevant Issues Concerning Foreign Exchange Control on Domestic Residents&rsquo; Offshore Investment and Financing
	and Roundtrip Investment through Special Purpose Vehicles, or SAFE Circular 37, on July 4, 2014, which replaced SAFE Circular 75.
	SAFE Circular 37 requires PRC residents to register with local branches of the SAFE in connection with their direct establishment
	or indirect control of an offshore entity, for the purpose of overseas investment and financing, with such PRC residents&rsquo;
	legally owned assets or equity interests in domestic enterprises or offshore assets or interests, referred to in SAFE Circular
	37 as a &ldquo;special purpose vehicle&rdquo;. The term &ldquo;control&rdquo; under SAFE Circular 37 is broadly defined as the
	operation rights, beneficiary rights or decision-making rights acquired by the PRC residents in the offshore special purpose vehicles
	by such means as acquisition, trust, proxy, voting rights, repurchase, convertible bonds or other arrangements. SAFE Circular 37
	further requires amendment to the registration in the event of any changes with respect to the basic information of the special
	purpose vehicle, such as changes in a PRC resident individual shareholder, name or operation period; or any significant changes
	with respect to the special purpose vehicle, such as increase or decrease of capital contributed by PRC individuals, share transfer
	or exchange, merger, division or other material event. If the shareholders of the offshore holding company who are PRC residents
	do not complete their registration with the local SAFE branches, the PRC subsidiaries may be prohibited from distributing their
	profits and proceeds from any reduction in capital, share transfer or liquidation to the offshore company, and the offshore company
	may be restricted in its ability to contribute additional capital to its PRC subsidiaries. Moreover, failure to comply with SAFE
	registration and amendment requirements described above could result in liability under PRC law for evasion of applicable foreign
	exchange restrictions.

	As substantially all of our management members
	are based in China, it remains unclear how the tax residency rule will apply to our case. We believe that none of our offshore
	holding companies should be treated as a &ldquo;resident enterprise&rdquo; for PRC tax purposes. However, as the tax resident status
	of an enterprise is subject to determination by the PRC tax authorities, there are uncertainties and risks associated with this
	issue. If the PRC tax authorities determine that any of our offshore holding companies are &ldquo;resident enterprises&rdquo; for
	PRC enterprise income tax purposes, a number of unfavorable PRC tax consequences could follow. First, we may be subject to enterprise
	income tax at a rate of 25% on our worldwide taxable income, as well as PRC enterprise income tax reporting obligations. Second,
	although under the EIT Law and its implementing rules, dividend income between qualified resident enterprises is a &ldquo;tax-exempt
	income,&rdquo; we cannot guarantee that dividends paid to TAL Education Group from our PRC subsidiaries through TAL Holding Limited,
	or TAL Hong Kong, or dividends paid from our PRC subsidiaries to Yidu Technology Group, which is incorporated in the Cayman Islands,
	through Yidu Technology Group Limited, which is incorporated in Hong Kong, or dividends paid from our PRC subsidiaries to Firstleap
	Education, which is incorporated in the Cayman Islands, through Firstleap Education (HK) Limited, which is incorporated in Hong
	Kong, would qualify as &ldquo;tax-exempt income&rdquo; and will not be subject to withholding tax, as the PRC foreign exchange
	control authorities, which enforce the withholding tax, have not yet issued guidance with respect to the processing of outbound
	remittances to entities that are treated as &ldquo;resident enterprises&rdquo; for PRC enterprise income tax purposes. Finally,
	the &ldquo;resident enterprise&rdquo; classification could result in a situation in which a 10% withholding tax is imposed on dividends
	we pay to our non-PRC enterprise shareholders and with respect to gains derived by our non-PRC and enterprise shareholders from
	transferring our notes, shares or ADSs, if such income is considered PRC-sourced income by the relevant PRC authorities. This could
	have the effect of increasing our and our shareholders&rsquo; effective income tax rates and may require us to deduct withholding
	tax from any dividends we pay to our non-PRC shareholders. In addition to the uncertainties regarding how the &ldquo;resident enterprise&rdquo;
	classification may apply, it is also possible that the rules may change in the future, possibly with retroactive effect.

	On February 6, 2015, the SAT issued the
	Announcement of the State Administration of Taxation on Several Issues Concerning the Enterprise Income Tax on Indirect Property
	Transfer by Non-Resident Enterprises, or SAT Bulletin 7, which terminated the aforementioned articles of SAT Circular 698. Pursuant
	to SAT Bulletin 7, where a non-resident enterprise indirectly transfers properties such as equity in PRC resident enterprises without
	any justifiable business purposes and aiming to avoid the payment of enterprise income tax, such indirect transfer must be reclassified
	as a direct transfer of equity in PRC resident enterprise. To assess whether an indirect transfer of PRC taxable properties has
	reasonable commercial purposes, all arrangements related to the indirect transfer must be considered comprehensively and factors
	set forth in SAT Bulletin 7 must be comprehensively analyzed in light of the actual circumstances. SAT Bulletin 7 also provides
	that, where a non-PRC resident enterprise transfers its equity interests in a resident enterprise to its related parties at a price
	lower than the fair market value, the competent tax authority has the power to make a reasonable adjustment to the taxable income
	of the transaction.

	There is little practical experience regarding
	the application of SAT Bulletin 7 because it was issued in February 2015. During the effective period of SAT Circular 698, some
	intermediary holding companies were actually looked through by the PRC tax authorities, and consequently the non-PRC resident investors
	were deemed to have transferred the PRC subsidiaries and PRC corporate taxes were assessed accordingly. It is possible that we
	or our non-PRC resident investors may become at risk of being taxed under SAT Bulletin 7 and may be required to expend valuable
	resources to comply with SAT Bulletin 7 or to establish that we or our non-PRC resident investors should not be taxed under SAT
	Bulletin 7, which may have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations or such non-PRC resident investors&rsquo;

	On December 20, 2007, the State Administration

	the State Administration of Press, Publication, Radio, Film and Television, or SAPPRFT), and the Ministry of Information Industry,
	or MII (which was superseded in 2008 by the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, or MIIT), issued the Administrative
	Measures Regarding Internet Audio-Video Program Services, or the Internet Audio-Video Program Measures, which became effective
	on January 31, 2008 and was revised on August 28, 2015. Among other things, the Internet Audio-Video Program Measures stipulate
	that no entities or individuals may provide Internet audio-video program services without a License for Disseminating Audio-Video
	Programs through Information Network issued by the SARFT or SAPPRFT (as applicable) or the relevant local branches or completing
	the relevant registration with the SARFT or SAPPRFT (as applicable) or the relevant local branches, and only entities wholly owned
	or controlled by the PRC government may engage in the production, editing, integration or consolidation, and transmission to the
	public through the Internet, of audio-video programs, or the provision of audio-video program uploading and transmission services.
	On February 3, 2008, the SARFT and the MII jointly held a press conference in response to inquiries related to the Internet Audio-Video
	Program Measures, during which the SARFT and the MII officials indicated that providers of audio-video program services established
	prior to the promulgation date of the Internet Audio-Video Program Measures that do not have any regulatory non-compliance records
	can re-register with the relevant government authorities to continue their current business operations. After the conference, the
	two authorities published a press release that confirmed the above guidelines. There are still significant uncertainties relating
	to the interpretation and implementation of the Internet Audio-Video Program Measures, in particular, the scope of Internet Audio-Video
	Programs.

	Our revenues and costs are mostly denominated
	in RMB. The value of the Renminbi against the U.S. dollar and other currencies is affected by, among other things, changes in PRC
	political and economic conditions and PRC foreign exchange policies. The conversion of Renminbi into foreign currencies, including
	U.S. dollar, is based on rates set by the People&rsquo;s Bank of China. The PRC government allowed the Renminbi to appreciate by
	more than 20% against the U.S. dollar between July 2005 and July 2008. Between July 2008 and June 2010, this appreciation was halted
	and the exchange rate between the Renminbi and the U.S. dollar remained within a narrow band. As a consequence, the Renminbi fluctuated
	significantly during that period against other freely traded currencies, in tandem with the U.S. dollar. After June 2010, the Renminbi
	began to appreciate against the U.S. dollar again, although there have been some periods when it has depreciated against the U.S.
	dollar, as it did for example during 2014 and 2016. It is difficult to predict how market forces or PRC or U.S. government policy
	may impact the exchange rate between the Renminbi and the U.S. dollar in the future.

	The PRC government imposes controls on the
	convertibility between the Renminbi and foreign currencies and, in certain cases, the remittance of currency out of China. Under
	our current corporate structure, our income is primarily derived from a share of the earnings from our PRC subsidiaries. Revenues
	of our PRC subsidiaries are all denominated in RMB. Shortages in the availability of foreign currency may restrict the ability
	of our PRC subsidiaries to remit sufficient foreign currency to pay dividends or other payments to us, or otherwise satisfy their
	foreign currency-denominated obligations. Under existing PRC foreign exchange regulations, payments of current account items, including
	profit distributions, interest payments and expenditures from trade-related transactions, can be made in foreign currencies without
	prior approval from the SAFE by complying with certain procedural requirements. However, for any PRC company, dividends can be
	declared and paid only out of the retained earnings of that company under PRC law. Furthermore, approval from the SAFE or its local
	branch is required where Renminbi is to be converted into foreign currency and remitted out of China to pay capital expenses, such
	as the repayment of loans denominated in foreign currencies. Specifically, under the existing exchange restrictions, without a
	prior approval of the SAFE, cash generated from the operations of our subsidiaries in China may be used to pay dividends by our
	PRC subsidiaries to TAL Education Group through our Hong Kong subsidiaries and pay employees of our PRC subsidiaries who are located
	outside China in a currency other than the Renminbi. With a prior approval from the SAFE, cash generated from the operations of
	our PRC subsidiaries and Consolidated Affiliated Entities may be used to pay off debt in a currency other than the RMB owed by
	our subsidiaries and Consolidated Affiliated Entities to entities outside China, and make other capital expenditures outside China
	in a currency other than the Renminbi. The PRC government may also at its discretion restrict access in the future to foreign currencies
	for current account transactions. If the foreign exchange control system prevents us from obtaining sufficient foreign currency
	to satisfy our currency demands, we may not be able to pay dividends in foreign currencies to our shareholders, including holders
	of our ADSs.

	Starting in 2011 the PRC affiliates of the
	&ldquo;big four&rdquo; accounting firms (including our independent registered public accounting firm) were affected by a conflict
	between U.S. and PRC law. Specifically, for certain U.S.-listed companies operating and audited in mainland China, the SEC and
	the PCAOB sought to obtain from the PRC firms access to their audit work papers and related documents. The firms were, however,
	advised and directed that under PRC law they could not respond directly to the U.S. regulators on those requests, and that requests
	by foreign regulators for access to such papers in China had to be channeled through the CSRC.

<P STYLE="FONT: 10PT TIMES NEW ROMAN, TIMES, SERIF; MARGIN: 0PT 0; TEXT-INDENT: 0.5IN">
	In late 2012, this impasse led the SEC to
	commence administrative proceedings under Rule 102(e) of its Rules of Practice and also under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 against
	the PRC-based accounting firms, including our independent registered public accounting firm. A first instance trial of the proceedings
	in July 2013 in the SEC&rsquo;s internal administrative court resulted in an adverse judgment against the firms. The administrative
	law judge proposed penalties on the firms including a temporary suspension of their right to practice before the SEC, although
	that proposed penalty did not take effect pending review by the SEC. On February 6, 2015, before SEC&rsquo;s review had taken place,
	the firms reached a settlement with the SEC. Under the settlement, the SEC accepts that future requests by the SEC for the production
	of documents will normally be made to the CSRC. The firms will receive matching Section 106 requests, and are required to abide
	by a detailed set of procedures with respect to such requests, which in substance require them to facilitate production via the
	CSRC. If they fail to meet specified criteria, the SEC retains the authority to impose a variety of additional remedial measures
	on the firms depending on the nature of the failure. Remedies for any future noncompliance could include, as appropriate, an automatic
	six-month bar on a single firm&rsquo;s performance of certain audit work, commencement of a new proceeding against a firm, or in
	extreme cases the resumption of the current proceeding against all four firms.

	In addition, the stock market in general,
	and the market prices for companies with operations in China in particular, have experienced volatility that often has been unrelated
	to the operating performance of such companies. The securities of some PRC-based companies that have listed their securities in
	the United States have experienced significant volatility since their initial public offerings, including, in some cases, substantial
	price declines in the trading prices of their securities. The trading performances of these PRC-based companies&rsquo; securities
	after their offerings may affect the attitudes of investors toward PRC-based companies listed in the United States, which consequently
	may impact the trading performance of our ADSs, regardless of our actual operating performance. In addition, any negative news

	other PRC-based companies may also negatively affect the attitudes of investors towards PRC-based companies in general, including
	us, regardless of whether we have conducted any inappropriate activities. Further, the global financial crisis, the ensuing economic
	recessions in many countries and the slowing Chinese economy have contributed and may continue to contribute to extreme volatility
	in the global stock markets. These broad market and industry fluctuations may adversely affect operating performance. Volatility
	or a lack of positive performance in our ADS price may also adversely affect our ability to retain key employees, some of whom

	result of which these securities would be converted into, or exchanged for, shares, other securities, other property or assets;

	for the taxable year ended February 29, 2016 and do not anticipate becoming a PFIC for the foreseeable future, no assurance can
	be given in this regard because the determination of whether we will be or become a PFIC is a fact-intensive inquiry made on an
	annual basis that depends, in part, on the composition of our income and assets. Fluctuations in the market price of our ADSs may
	cause us to become a PFIC for the current or subsequent taxable years because the value of assets for the purpose of the asset
	test may be determined by reference to the market price of our ADSs from time to time (which may be volatile). The composition
	of our income and assets may also be affected by how, and how quickly, we use our liquid assets. Under circumstances where our
	revenue from activities that produce passive income significantly increase relative to our revenue from activities that produce
	non-passive income, or where we determine not to deploy significant amounts of cash for active purposes, our risk of becoming classified
	as a PFIC may substantially increase.

	If we were to be or become classified as
	a PFIC, a U.S. Holder (as defined in &ldquo;Item 10.E.&mdash;Additional Information&mdash;Taxation&mdash;U.S. Federal Income Tax
	Considerations&mdash;General&rdquo;) may be subject to reporting requirements and may incur significantly increased U.S. federal
	income tax on gain recognized on the sale or other disposition of the ADSs or common shares and on the receipt of distributions
	on the ADSs or common shares to the extent such gain or distribution is treated as an &ldquo;excess distribution&rdquo; under the
	U.S. federal income tax rules. Further, if we were a PFIC for any year during which a U.S. Holder held our ADSs or common shares,
	we generally would continue to be treated as a PFIC for all succeeding years during which such U.S. Holder held our ADSs or common
	shares. You are urged to consult your tax advisor concerning the U.S. federal income tax consequences of holding and disposing
	of ADSs or common shares if we are or become classified as a PFIC. For more information see &ldquo;Item 10.E.&mdash;Additional

	students can receive more individual attention from teachers than what they would typically experience in a large class setting
	and are able to learn in an interactive group environment. We design curricula catering to our students&rsquo; different educational
	requirements and needs. Many of our classes for the same subject and grade level are offered at different levels of difficulty
	to better cater to the different needs of our students. For instance, for our Xueersi Peiyou small classes, we offer mathematics
	tutoring in the forms of basic classes, advanced classes, which are taught at a faster pace than basic classes, intensive classes,
	which are conducted at an even more accelerated pace, and specialized classes, which cater to the needs of advanced students and
	focus on specialized training for mathematics competitions. We periodically assess our students&rsquo; progress, and based on the
	results of such assessment, reassign students to different classes on an as-needed basis such that each student&rsquo;s situation
	and needs are taken into consideration.

	Substantially all of our education content

	For the science subjects offered through
	Xueersi Peiyou small classes, our team works closely with experts in different subject fields to keep up with changing academic
	and examination requirements in the PRC education system and solicits feedback from our teachers based on their classroom experience.
	The development process of our curricula and course materials typically starts with reviewing and referencing recent teaching materials
	and teachers&rsquo; training materials from leading public schools as well as any new examination requirements to analyze the latest
	market trends and needs. Our development team is able to identify subjects and concepts that are difficult for students and focuses
	on the most important and difficult concepts and skills in the curricula. To address different educational requirements and needs
	of our students at each grade level, we have also developed curricula and course materials tailored for classes of different difficulty
	levels based on that group of students&rsquo; learning curves as well as their strengths and weaknesses. We evaluate, update and
	improve course materials based upon usage rate, feedback from teachers, students and parents as well as student performance. Most
	of our curricula and course materials are developed at our corporate level in Beijing and adopted by other locations with modifications
	to meet local requirements and demands. We have modularized a portion of our course materials based on specific topics so that
	centrally developed content can be more easily adopted locally and make our services more scalable, and we are in the process of
	modularizing other portions of our course materials.

	In addition, we cooperated with McGraw-Hill
	Education to co-develop and co-brand two sets of English language educational materials for Xueersi Peiyou small classes in 2012.
	In March 2014, we, through our &ldquo;Lejiale&rdquo; brand which offers English subject tutoring services, collaborated closely
	with Cambridge University Press, and together, launched a series of English learning materials called &ldquo;Hello Learner&rsquo;s
	English.&rdquo; The Hello Learner&rsquo;s English series of learning materials is tailored specifically for Chinese students, from
	grades one through six, and introduces new learning patterns for students to advance their English speaking, listening, reading
	and writing abilities, preparing students to pass the government authorized English examinations or well-recognized English assessment
	tests, and for their future secondary school or college English entrance examinations.

	For our Xueersi Peiyou business, personalized

	in China, as well as experienced teachers with a solid track record and strong reputation from other schools. Each of our newly
	hired full-time teachers is required to undergo certain standard and customized trainings that focus on education content, teaching
	skills and techniques as well as our corporate culture and values. In addition, our teachers are regularly evaluated for their
	classroom performance and teaching results. Our teachers&rsquo; retention, compensation and promotion are to a large extent based
	on the results of such evaluations. The evaluation process is highly rigorous and, for our small-class business, it is based mainly
	on four factors: student retention rate, refund rate, class fulfillment rate and student and parent satisfaction rate. We offer
	our teachers competitive and performance-based compensation packages and provide them with prospects of career advancement within
	the company. Our best teachers may be promoted to become directors of our operations in new geographic markets outside Beijing,
	invited to participate in our educational content development effort and even considered for senior management positions.

	We intend to open new learning and service
	centers both in our existing and newly identified geographic markets to capitalize on growth opportunities. We have adopted a systematic
	approach to expansion of our learning centers and geographic markets. The decision on whether to enter a new city is typically
	made at the corporate business unit level and involves a well-established process requiring participation by different levels of
	management personnel within our organizational structure. Our process in identifying a new market involves developing plans for
	promoting our brand locally, recruiting teachers and other staff and commencing course offerings with an initial focus on certain
	core subjects and grades. In then selecting the locations for new learning centers, we perform studies of each location by gathering
	education statistics, demographic data, public transportation information and other data.

	On March 18, 1995, the National People&rsquo;s
	Congress enacted the Education Law of the PRC. The Education Law sets forth provisions relating to the fundamental education systems
	of China, including a school system of preschool education, primary education, secondary education (including middle and high schools)
	and higher education, a system of nine-year compulsory education and a system of education certificates. The Education Law stipulates
	that the government formulates plans for the development of education, and establishes and operates schools and other institutions
	of education. Under the Education Law, enterprises, social organizations and individuals are in principle encouraged to operate
	schools and other types of educational organizations in accordance with PRC laws and regulations. Meanwhile, no organization or
	individual may establish or operate a school or any other institution of education for profit-making purposes. However, private

	The Law for Promoting Private Education
	became effective on September 1, 2003 and was amended on June 29, 2013. The Implementation Rules for the Law for Promoting Private
	Education became effective on April 1, 2004. Under these regulations, &ldquo;private schools&rdquo; are defined as schools established
	by non-governmental organizations or individuals using non-government funds. In addition, under the regulations, private schools
	providing certifications, pre-school education, self-study aid and other academic education are subject to approval by the education
	authorities, while private schools engaging in occupational qualification training and occupational skill training are subject
	to approval by the authorities in charge of labor and social welfare. A duly approved private school will be granted a private
	school operating permit, and shall be registered with the Ministry of Civil Affairs or its local branches as a privately run non-enterprise
	institution. In addition, learning centers of schools must make filings with the MoE or its local branches. Our 47 affiliated schools
	have all obtained and maintained their respective private school operating permits and have registered with the Ministry of Civil
	Affairs or its relevant local branch.

	Under the above regulations, private schools
	have the same status as public schools, though private schools are prohibited from providing military, police, political and other
	kinds of education that are of a special nature. Government-run schools that provide compulsory education are not permitted to
	be converted into private schools. In addition, operation of a private school is highly regulated. For example, the types and amounts
	of fees charged by a private school providing certifications shall be approved by the pricing authority and be publicly disclosed.
	A private school that does not provide certifications shall file its pricing information with the pricing authority and publicly
	disclose such information. We do not offer any degree or certification course and thus we shall file our pricing information with
	the relevant pricing authorities in the school districts where we have operations. We disclose our pricing information for our
	services provided by our private schools to the public.

	At the end of each fiscal year, every private
	school is required to allocate a certain amount to its development fund for the construction or maintenance of school facilities
	or procurement or upgrade of educational equipment. In the case of a private school that requires reasonable returns, this amount
	shall be no less than 25% of the annual net income of the school, while in the case of a private school that does not require reasonable
	returns, this amount shall be equal to no less than 25% of the annual increase in the net assets of the school, if any. Private
	schools that do not require reasonable returns shall be entitled to the same preferential tax treatment as public schools, while
	the preferential tax treatment policies applicable to private schools requiring reasonable returns shall be formulated by the finance
	authority, taxation authority and other authorities under the State Council. To date, however, no regulations have been promulgated
	by the relevant authorities in this regard. As of April 30, 2016, among our 47 affiliated schools, 17 had elected not to require
	reasonable returns and the remaining 30 had elected to require reasonable returns. Because no preferential tax policies have been
	promulgated by the relevant authorities, none of our 47 affiliated schools enjoys any preferential tax treatments pursuant to the
	requirements of local governmental authorities. All of them have allocated certain amounts to their development funds in compliance

	The &ldquo;sponsorship interest&rdquo; that
	a sponsor holds in a private school is, for all practical purposes, substantially equivalent under PRC law and practice to the
	&ldquo;equity interest&rdquo; a shareholder holds in a company. Pursuant to the Implementation Rules for Promoting Private Education,
	a sponsor of a private school has the obligation to make capital contributions to the school in a timely manner. The contributed
	capital can be in the form of tangible or non-tangible assets such as materials in kind, land use rights or intellectual property
	rights. Pursuant to the Law for Promoting Private Education, the capital contributed by the sponsor becomes assets of the school
	and the school has independent legal person status. In addition, pursuant to the Law for Promoting Private Education and the Implementation
	Rules for Promoting Private Education, the sponsor of a private school has the right to exercise ultimate control over the school
	by becoming the member of and controlling the composition of the school&rsquo;s decision making body. Specifically, the sponsor
	has control over the private school&rsquo;s constitutional documents and has the right to elect and replace the private school&rsquo;s
	decision making bodies, such as the school&rsquo;s board of directors, and therefore controls the private school&rsquo;s business
	and affairs.

	Before the Law for Promoting Private Education
	took effect in 2003, the Regulations on Schools Run by Different Sectors of Society had provided that upon liquidation, the residual
	assets of a private school after the original investment had been returned to the sponsor would be used by the relevant PRC government

	We are not aware of any PRC law which provides
	that upon liquidation of a private school, the sponsor is legally restricted to receive only its invested capital and is not allowed
	to receive other returns. According to our PRC counsel, there is no national law that addresses this subject one way or the other.
	In the absence of a national law providing for the sponsor&rsquo;s rights upon liquidation of a private school, provincial regulations
	and interpretations are ambiguous and inconsistent on this subject. There are local regulations or interpretations that specifically
	provide that sponsors are entitled to private schools&rsquo; residual assets pro rata based on their respective capital contribution.
	Nevertheless, there are also local regulations that are less clear in this regard.

	Notwithstanding the legal uncertainties
	surrounding this issue, we believe that the potential risk that we will not receive all of the residual assets upon the liquidation
	of a school is immaterial. There were no capital contributions made by any PRC governmental authorities to our schools, nor did
	any of our schools ever receive donations from any third parties, including PRC governmental authorities or any third party enterprises.
	Since the Law for Promoting Private Education became effective on September 1, 2003, neither we nor our PRC counsel have been aware
	of any case in China where a private school which has been solely funded by private sponsors without any government or donated
	funds became state property or was otherwise appropriated by a government authority upon liquidation without the prior consent
	of its sponsor. We historically have never liquidated any school that was profitable and we have no plans to so in the future.
	If, for any reason, we would like to divest a profitable school, a commercially sensible way to do so is to sell, rather than liquidate,
	the school. When selling a school, the sponsor is entitled to receive consideration for transferring sponsorship, which often exceeds
	its initial investment in the school.

	On July 29, 2010, the PRC central government
	promulgated the Outline of PRC National Plan for Medium- and Long-Term Education Reform and Development (2010-2020), which for
	the first time announced the policy that the government will implement a reform to divide private education entities into two categories:
	(1) for-profit private education entities and (2) not-for-profit private education entities. On October 24, 2010, the General Office
	of the State Council issued the Notices on the National Education System Innovation Pilot. Under this notice, the PRC government
	plans to implement a for-profit and non-profit classified management system for the private schools in Shanghai, Zhejiang, Shenzhen
	and Jilin Huaqiao Foreign Language School. However, the above outline and the innovation pilot is still new and no additional national
	law or regulation has been promulgated to implement them and, except in Shanghai, no other local government of the pilot areas
	has promulgated relevant regulations on differentiated management of the private schools. Shanghai promulgated the Interim Measures
	for the Registration of Operational Private Training Institutions, which requires for-profit private training institutions to register
	with local administration of industry and commerce bureau and will remain effective until August 8, 2015. If, upon the implementation
	of the above reform, our schools choose to be for-profit private education entities, they may be subject to all the taxes that
	are applicable to enterprises as if they were enterprises; if our schools choose to be not-for-profit private education entities,
	our VIE Contractual Arrangements may be subject to more stringent scrutiny and the education authorities may not allow our schools
	to pay us services fees under the VIE Contractual Arrangements as they currently do. As a result, the implementation of this reform
	may adversely affect our results of operations.

	In January 2015, the MoC published a discussion
	draft of the proposed Foreign Investment Law aiming to, upon its enactment, replace the trio of existing laws regulating foreign

	Among other things, the draft Foreign Investment
	Law expands the definition of foreign investment and introduces the standard of &ldquo;actual control&rdquo; in determining whether
	a company is considered a foreign-invested enterprise, or an FIE. The draft Foreign Investment Law specifically provides that entities
	established in China but &ldquo;controlled&rdquo; by foreign investors must be deemed as FIEs, whereas an entity set up in a foreign
	jurisdiction would nonetheless be, upon market entry clearance by the MoC, treated as a PRC domestic investor provided that the
	entity is &ldquo;controlled&rdquo; by PRC entities and/or citizens. In this connection, &ldquo;control&rdquo; is broadly defined
	in the draft law to cover the following summarized categories: (i) holding 50% or more of the voting rights or similar equity interest
	of the subject entity; (ii) holding less than 50% of the voting rights or similar equity interest of the subject entity but having
	the power to secure at least 50% of the seats on the board or other equivalent decision making bodies, or having the voting power
	to exert material influence on the board, the shareholders&rsquo; meeting or other equivalent decision making bodies; or (iii)
	having the power to exert decisive influence, via contractual or trust arrangements, over the subject entity&rsquo;s operations,
	financial matters or other key aspects of business operations. Once an entity is determined to be an FIE, and its investment amount
	exceeds certain thresholds or its business operation falls within a &ldquo;negative list,&rdquo; to be separately issued by the
	State Council in the future and to replace the Foreign-Investment Industrial Guidance Catalog, market entry clearance by the MoC
	or its local counterparts will be required. Otherwise, all foreign investors may make investments on the same terms as domestic
	investors without being subject to additional approval from the government authorities as mandated by the existing foreign investment
	legal regime.

	Under the draft Foreign Investment Law,
	variable interest entities that are controlled via contractual arrangement would also be deemed as FIEs, if they are ultimately
	&ldquo;controlled&rdquo; by foreign investors. Therefore, for any companies with a &ldquo;variable interest entity&rdquo; structure
	in an industry category that is on the &ldquo;negative list,&rdquo; the &ldquo;variable interest entity&rdquo; structure may be
	deemed legitimate only if the ultimate controlling person(s) is/are of PRC nationality (either PRC state-owned enterprises or agencies
	or PRC citizens). Conversely, if the actual controlling person (s) is/are of foreign nationalities, then the variable interest
	entities will be treated as FIEs and any operation in the industry category on the &ldquo;negative list&rdquo; without market entry
	clearance may be considered as illegal. However, the draft Foreign Investment Law has not taken a position on what actions shall
	be taken with respect to the existing companies with a &ldquo;variable interest entity&rdquo; structure, whether or not these companies
	are controlled by PRC parties, while it has solicited comments from the public on this point.

	The draft Foreign Investment Law also imposes
	stringent ad hoc and periodic information reporting requirements on foreign investors and the applicable FIEs. Aside from investment
	implementation report and investment amendment report that are required at each investment and alteration of investment specifics,
	an annual report is mandatory, and large foreign investors meeting certain criteria are required to report on a quarterly basis.
	Some of the information requested may be sensitive to foreign investors, such as the identity of the actual controller and the
	source of investment. Any company found to be non-compliant with these information reporting obligations may potentially be subject
	to fines and/or administrative or criminal liabilities, and the persons directly responsible may be subject to criminal liabilities.

	an offshore entity, for the purpose of overseas investment and financing, with such PRC residents&rsquo; legally owned assets or
	equity interests in domestic enterprises or offshore assets or interests, referred to in SAFE Circular 37 as a &ldquo;special purpose
	vehicle&rdquo;. The term &ldquo;control&rdquo; under SAFE Circular 37 is broadly defined as the operation rights, beneficiary rights
	or decision-making rights acquired by the PRC residents in the offshore special purpose vehicles by such means as acquisition,
	trust, proxy, voting rights, repurchase, convertible bonds or other arrangements. SAFE Circular 37 further requires amendment to
	the registration in the event of any changes with respect to the basic information of the special purpose vehicle, such as changes
	in a PRC resident individual shareholder, name or operation period; or any significant changes with respect to the special purpose
	vehicle, such as increase or decrease of capital contributed by PRC individuals, share transfer or exchange, merger, division or
	other material event. If the shareholders of the offshore holding company who are PRC residents do not complete their registration
	with the local SAFE branches, the PRC subsidiaries may be prohibited from distributing their profits and proceeds from any reduction
	in capital, share transfer or liquidation to the offshore company, and the offshore company may be restricted in its ability to
	contribute additional capital to its PRC subsidiaries. Moreover, failure to comply with the SAFE registration and amendment requirements
	described above could result in liability under PRC law for evasion of applicable foreign exchange restrictions.

	Pursuant to applicable PRC regulations on
	foreign currency exchange, the Renminbi is freely convertible to foreign currencies for current account items only, such as trade-related
	receipts and payments, interest and dividends. Conversion of Renminbi to foreign exchange for capital account items, such as direct
	equity investments, loans and repatriation of investments, are subject to the prior approval of the SAFE or its local branches
	or prior registration with banks. Payments for transactions that take place within China must be made in RMB. Domestic companies
	or individuals can repatriate payments received from abroad in foreign currencies or deposit those payments abroad subject to the
	requirement that such payments be repatriated within a certain period of time. Foreign-invested enterprises may retain foreign
	exchange in accounts with designated foreign exchange banks. Foreign exchange on the current account can be either retained or
	sold to financial institutions that have foreign exchange settlement or sales business without prior approval from the SAFE, subject
	to certain regulations. Foreign exchange on the capital account can be retained or sold to financial institutions that have foreign
	exchange settlement and sales business with prior approval of the SAFE, unless otherwise provided.

	In addition, on August 29, 2008, the SAFE
	promulgated a notice regulating the conversion by a foreign-invested company of its capital contribution in foreign currency into
	Renminbi, or SAFE Circular 142, which restricts the use of RMB funds converted from foreign exchange. It requires that RMB converted
	from foreign currency-denominated capital of a foreign-invested enterprise may only be used for purposes within the business scope
	approved by the relevant government authority and may not be used to make equity investments China, unless specifically provided
	otherwise. Moreover, the approved use of such RMB funds may not be changed without approval from the SAFE. RMB funds converted
	from foreign exchange may not be used to repay loans in RMB if the proceeds of such loans have not yet been used. Any violation
	of SAFE Circular 142 may result in severe penalties, including substantial fines. On March 30, 2015, the SAFE promulgated the Notice
	on Reforming the Management Method relating to Conversion of the Capital Contribution of Foreign Invested Company from Foreign
	Exchange to Renminbi, or SAFE Circular 19. Although SAFE Circular 142 was abolished when SAFE Circular 19 became effective on June
	1, 2015, the foregoing rules have been retained in SAFE Circular 19. On February 13, 2015, the SAFE promulgated the Notice on Further
	Simplifying and Improving the Policies of Foreign Exchange Administration Applicable to Direct Investment, or SAFE Circular 13,
	which was effective on June 1, 2015. Pursuant to SAFE Circular 13, annual foreign exchange inspection of direct investment is not
	required anymore and the registration of existing equity is required. SAFE Circular 13 also grants the authority to banks to examine
	and process foreign exchange registration with respect to both domestic and overseas direct investment.

	We expect that PRC regulations concerning
	loans and direct investment by offshore holding companies to PRC entities will continue to limit our use of proceeds from offshore
	offerings. There are no costs associated with registering loans or capital contributions with relevant PRC authorities, other than
	nominal processing charges. Under PRC laws and regulations, the PRC government authorities are required to process such approvals
	or registrations or deny our application within a maximum of 90 days. The actual time taken, however, may be longer due to administrative
	delay. We cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain these government registrations or approvals on a timely basis, if at
	all, with respect to our future plans to use the U.S. dollar proceeds we received from offshore offerings for our expansion and
	operations in China. If we fail to receive such registrations or approvals, our ability to use the proceeds from our offshore offerings
	and to capitalize our PRC operations may be negatively affected, which could materially and adversely affect our liquidity and
	ability to fund and expand our business.

	Under applicable PRC laws and regulations,
	companies in China may pay dividends only out of their accumulated profits, if any, determined in accordance with PRC accounting
	standards and regulations. In addition, companies in China are required to allocate at least 10% of their accumulated profits each
	year, if any, to fund statutory reserves of up to 50% of the registered capital of the enterprise. Statutory reserves are not distributable
	as cash dividends. Each of our subsidiaries, VIEs and VIEs&rsquo; subsidiaries in China are required to comply with this statutory
	reserves funding requirement. Although the statutory surplus reserves can be used, among other ways, to increase the registered
	capital and eliminate future losses in excess of retained earnings of the respective companies, the reserve funds are not distributable
	as cash dividends except in the event of liquidation. In addition, at the end of each fiscal year, each of our affiliated schools
	in China is required to allocate a certain amount out of its annual net income, if any, to its development fund for the construction
	or maintenance of the school or procurement or upgrade of educational equipment. For our 30 private schools which have elected
	to require reasonable returns, this amount shall be no less than 25% of the annual net income of the school, and for the remaining
	17 private schools which have elected not to require reasonable returns, this amount shall be equivalent to no less than 25% of
	the annual increase in the net assets of the school, if any. As a result of these PRC laws and regulations, as of February 29,
	2016, we had $23.0 million in statutory surplus reserves and development fund, or 5.2% of total equity, that are not distributable
	as cash dividends. We do not expect that the statutory surplus reserve requirement will materially limit our ability to pay dividends
	to our shareholders or our plan to expand our business because we are to date only required to set aside an additional $9.7 million
	to satisfy the maximum requirement of statutory surplus reserves for all of our PRC subsidiaries and our Consolidated Affiliated
	Entities.

	option. TAL Beijing, Xinxin Xiangrong and the shareholders of Xinxin Xiangrong have entered into a call option agreement on
	August 4, 2015, and Lebai Information, Lebai Education and the sole shareholder of Lebai Education have entered into a call
	option agreement on October 26, 2015, the terms of which are substantially the same as the call option agreement summarized
	above. These agreements become effective on the date of execution and terminate when all of the obligations and rights under
	such agreement are completely performed. Under each of these agreements, TAL Beijing or Lebai Information has sole
	discretion to decide when to exercise the option, and whether to exercise the option in part or in full. The key factor for
	us to decide whether to exercise the option is whether the current regulatory restrictions on foreign investment in the
	educational service business will be removed in the future, the likelihood of which we are not in a position to know or
	comment on.

	We have benefited significantly from the
	overall economic growth, the increase in household disposable income, the rising household spending on private education and the
	intense competition for quality education in China, which has caused the K-12 after-school tutoring market in China to grow in
	recent years. We anticipate that the demand for K-12 after-school tutoring services will continue to grow. However, any adverse

	Our results of operations are also affected

	Beijing conducted by our PRC subsidiaries, Huanqiu Zhikang and Zhixuesi Beijing, substantially all of our education business in
	China is conducted through the VIE Contractual Arrangements. We do not have equity interests in our VIEs. However, as a result
	of the VIE Contractual Arrangements, we are the primary beneficiary of these entities and treat them as our variable interest entities

	Entities and wholly owned subsidiaries in China are in compliance with existing PRC laws and regulations, and (ii) the VIE Contractual
	Arrangements are valid, binding and enforceable under, and will not result in any violation of, PRC laws or regulations currently
	in effect. We have been advised by our PRC counsel, however, that there are substantial uncertainties regarding the interpretation
	and application of current and future PRC laws and regulations. See &ldquo;Item 3.D.&mdash;Key Information&mdash;Risk Factors&mdash;Risks
	Related to Our Corporate Structure&mdash;If the PRC government determines that the agreements that establish the structure for

	Our ability to maintain and increase profitability

	Our operating expenses include two key components,
	selling and marketing expenses and general and administrative expenses. Our total operating expenses as a percentage of our total
	net revenues was 33.8%, 37.8% and 37.8% for the fiscal years ended February 28/29, 2014, 2015 and 2016, respectively. Relative

	flat from the fiscal year ended February 28, 2015, but still higher than the fiscal year ended February 28, 2014. The absolute
	value of our selling and marketing expenses and our general and administrative expenses each grew over this time period. Our selling
	and marketing expenses grew primarily due to an increase in the number of our sales and marketing personnel and their respective
	salaries to support a greater number of program and service offerings. Our general and administrative expenses grew primarily due
	to increases in the number of our general and administrative personnel, in particular personnel supporting our online education
	initiatives and other new programs and service offerings. An increase in the average salaries and benefits provided to our general
	and administrative staff, an increase in fees paid to our professional advisors and service providers, share-based compensation,
	and related office expenses. The growth of our selling and marketing expenses and our general administrative expenses has also
	been a result of the expansion of our learning centers and service centers capacity over the past few years. Going forward, we
	expect that our total costs and expenses will continue to increase due to the expansion of our services and operations, including
	our online education initiatives and other new programs and service offerings, as well as costs and ongoing expenses associated
	with being a public company; however, such increase is likely to be partially offset by our increasing economies of scale and improved

	As a Cayman Islands holding company, we
	may receive dividends from our PRC operating subsidiaries through TAL Hong Kong. The EIT Law and its implementing rules provide
	that dividends paid by a PRC entity to a non-resident enterprise for income tax purposes is subject to PRC withholding tax at a
	rate of 10%, subject to reduction by an applicable tax treaty with China. According to the Arrangement between Mainland China and
	the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and Prevention of Fiscal Evasion, dividends paid
	to shareholders residing in Hong Kong are subject to a reduced 5% rate of tax withholding provided the Hong Kong residents&rsquo;
	equity interests in the mainland dividend issuer is above 25%. However, the SAT promulgated SAT Circular 601 on October 27, 2009,
	which provides guidance for determining whether a resident of a contracting state is the &ldquo;beneficial owner&rdquo; of an item
	of income under PRC tax treaties and tax arrangements. According to SAT Circular 601, a beneficial owner generally must engage
	in substantive business activities. An agent or conduit company will not be regarded as a beneficial owner and, therefore, will
	not qualify for treaty benefits. A conduit company normally refers to a company that is set up for the purpose of avoiding or reducing
	taxes or transferring or accumulating profits. Although we may use our Hong Kong subsidiaries as a platform to expand our business
	in the future, our Hong Kong subsidiaries currently do not engage in any substantive business activities and thus it is possible
	that our Hong Kong subsidiaries may not be regarded as &ldquo;beneficial owners&rdquo; for the purposes of SAT Circular 601 and
	the dividends they receive from our PRC subsidiaries would be subject to withholding tax at a rate of 10%. In addition, our Hong
	Kong subsidiaries may be considered PRC resident enterprises for enterprise income tax purposes if the relevant PRC tax authorities
	determine that our Hong Kong subsidiaries&rsquo; &ldquo;de facto management bodies&rdquo; are within China, in which case dividends
	received by them from our PRC subsidiaries would be exempt from PRC withholding tax because such income is exempted under the EIT
	Law for a PRC resident enterprise recipient. As there remain uncertainties regarding the interpretation and implementation of the
	EIT Law and its implementation rules, it is uncertain whether, if we are deemed a PRC resident enterprise, any dividends to be
	distributed by us to our non-PRC shareholders and ADS holders would be subject to any PRC withholding tax. For a detailed discussion
	of PRC tax issues related to resident enterprise status, see &ldquo;Item 3.D.&mdash;Key Information&mdash;Risk Factors&mdash;Risks
	Related to Doing Business in China&mdash;Under the EIT Law, we may be classified as a PRC &ldquo;resident enterprise&rdquo;. Such
	classification could result in unfavorable tax consequences to us and our non-PRC shareholders.&rdquo;

	Significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes, our deferred tax assets and liabilities
	and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets, including evaluating uncertainties in the application
	of accounting principles and complex tax laws.

	We account for income taxes using the asset
	and liability approach. Under this method, deferred income taxes are recognized for temporary differences between the tax basis
	of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the financial statements, net of operating loss carry forwards and credits,
	by applying enacted statutory tax rates applicable to future years. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when,
	in the opinion of management, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.
	Current income taxes are provided for in accordance with the laws and regulations applicable to the Group as enacted by the relevant
	tax authorities. The components of the deferred tax assets and liabilities are individually classified as current and non-current
	based on the characteristics of the underlying assets and liabilities.

	We account for uncertain tax positions by
	reporting a liability for unrecognized tax benefits resulting from uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax
	return. Tax benefits are recognized from uncertain tax positions when we believe that it is more likely than not that the tax position
	will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position. We recognize interest
	and penalties, if any, related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense.

	Uncertainties exist with respect to how
	the EIT Law applies to our overall operations, and more specifically, with regard to our tax residency status. The EIT Law includes
	a provision specifying that legal entities organized outside China will be considered residents for PRC income tax purposes if
	their &ldquo;de facto management bodies&rdquo; are within China. The Implementation Rules define the term &ldquo;de facto management
	bodies&rdquo; as &ldquo;establishments that carry out substantial and overall management and control over the manufacturing and
	business operations, personnel, accounting, properties, etc. of an enterprise.&rdquo; Despite the present uncertainties resulting
	from the limited PRC tax guidance on the issue, we do not believe that our legal entities organized outside China should be treated
	as residents under the EIT Law. In addition, we are not aware of any offshore holding companies with a similar corporate structure
	as our company&rsquo;s ever having been deemed to be PRC &ldquo;resident enterprises&rdquo; by the PRC tax authorities. Therefore,
	we believe that none of TAL Education Group, TAL Hong Kong, Yidu Technology Group, Yidu Technology Group Limited, Firstleap Education
	and Firstleap Education (HK) Limited should be treated as a &ldquo;resident enterprise&rdquo; for PRC tax purposes. However, as
	the tax resident status of an enterprise is subject to determination by the PRC tax authorities, there are uncertainties and risks
	associated with this issue. See &ldquo;Item 3.D.&mdash;Key Information&mdash;Risk Factors&mdash;Risks Related to Doing Business
	in China&mdash;Under the EIT Law, we may be classified as a PRC &ldquo;resident enterprise&rdquo;. Such classification could result
	in unfavorable tax consequences to us and our non-PRC shareholders.&rdquo;

	to $619.9 million for the fiscal year ended February 29, 2016 from $434.0 million for the fiscal year ended February 28, 2015.
	The increase was mainly driven by an increase in total student enrollments. Total student enrollments increased by 54.6% to approximately
	2,309,830 as of February 29, 2016 from approximately 1,494,430 as of February 28, 2015. The increase in total student enrollments
	resulted primarily from an increase in enrollments in our small-class offerings and online courses. Average selling price decreased
	to $268 in fiscal year 2016 from $290 in fiscal year 2015. The decrease of average selling price was mainly due to more enrollment
	contribution from online courses and small-class offerings as well as foreign exchange rate fluctuation, and was partially offset
	by an increase in the hourly rate of small-class offerings.

	Our cost of revenues increased by 49.5%
	to $303.6 million for the fiscal year ended February 29, 2016 from $203.1 million for the fiscal year ended February 28, 2015.
	This increase was largely due to the increase in teacher fees and performance-linked bonuses to $146.1 million for the fiscal year
	ended February 29, 2016 from $90.1 million for the fiscal year ended February 28, 2015, primarily because the number of our full-time
	teachers increased to 6,594 for the fiscal year ending February 29, 2016 from 4,367 for the fiscal year ended February 28, 2015,
	and average teacher fees and performance-linked bonuses also increased. The number of contract teachers increased slightly from
	1,158 to 1,794 during the same period. Staff costs, which primarily consist of salaries, benefits and performance-linked bonuses
	for personnel providing educational service support and base salaries and other compensation for full-time teachers, increased
	to $34.0 million for the fiscal year ended February 29, 2016 from $26.1 million for the fiscal year ended February 28, 2015. This
	increase was mainly due to an increase in the number of our staff to expand our network and operations by opening new learning
	centers and service centers and an increase in the average salaries of our existing personnel who provide educational service support.
	Rental costs for our facilities increased to $84.4 million for the fiscal year ended February 29, 2016 from $60.4 million for the
	fiscal year ended February 28, 2015, primarily due to the increase in the leased space of learning centers and service centers
	from approximately 317,000 square meters as of February 28, 2015 to approximately 491,000 square meters as of February 29, 2016.
	To a lesser extent, the increase in our cost of revenues was due to increases in the costs of course material and teaching appliance,
	which was primarily a result of the expansion of our learning centers and the continuous improvement in teaching quality. Cost
	of revenues for the fiscal year ended February 29, 2016 included $42.7 thousand in share-based compensation expenses, as compared
	to $47.8 thousand for the fiscal year ended February 28, 2015.

	We incurred other expenses of $2.5 million
	for the fiscal year ended February 29, 2016, compared to $2.0 million for the fiscal year ended February 28, 2015. The increase
	was mainly due to an increase in exchange losses arising from the more significant depreciation of RMB against U.S. dollar in fiscal
	year 2016, partially offset by a gain from transfer of a nonfinancial asset and a gain on re-measurement of fair value of a noncontrolling
	equity investment in connection with a business acquisition. As we had been holding a significant portion of our cash balance denominated
	in RMB and reported in US dollars, until the majority of the cash balance in RMB were converted into U.S. dollar in the fourth

	from $151.5 million for the fiscal year ended February 28, 2014 to $203.1 million for the fiscal year ended February 28, 2015.
	This increase was largely due to the increase in teacher fees and performance-linked bonuses from $66.7 million for the fiscal
	year ended February 28, 2014 to $90.1 million for the fiscal year ended February 28, 2015, primarily because the number of our

	28, 2015, and average teacher fees and performance-linked bonuses also increased. The number of contract teachers decreased slightly

	from $21.6 million for the fiscal year ended February 28, 2014 to $26.1 million for the fiscal year ended February 28, 2015. This
	increase was mainly due to an increase in the number of our staff to expand our network and operations by opening new learning
	centers and service centers and an increase in the average salaries of our existing personnel who provide educational service support.
	Rental costs for our facilities increased from $44.0 million for the fiscal year ended February 28, 2014 to $60.4 million for the
	fiscal year ended February 28, 2015, primarily due to the increase in the leased space of learning centers and service centers
	from approximately 242,100 square meters as of February 28, 2014 to approximately 317,000 square meters as of February 28, 2015.
	To a lesser extent, the increase in our cost of revenues was due to increases in the depreciation and amortization costs of our
	property and equipment, which was primarily a result of the expansion of our learning centers. Cost of revenues for the fiscal
	year ended February 28, 2015 included $47.8 thousand in share-based compensation expenses, as compared to $47.9 thousand for the

	In April 2014, the
	Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, issued a new pronouncement which amends to change the criteria for
	reporting discontinued operations while enhancing disclosures in this area. It also addresses sources of confusion and
	inconsistent application related to financial reporting of discontinued operations guidance in U.S. GAAP. Under the new
	guidance, only disposals representing a strategic shift in operations should be presented as discontinued operations. Those
	strategic shifts should have a major effect on the organization&rsquo;s operations and financial results. Examples include a
	disposal of a major geographic area, a major line of business, or a major equity method investment. In addition, the new
	guidance requires expanded disclosures about discontinued operations that will provide financial statement users with more
	information about the assets, liabilities, income, and expenses of discontinued operations. The new guidance also requires
	disclosure of the pre-tax income attributable to a disposal of a significant part of an organization that does not qualify
	for discontinued operations reporting. This disclosure will provide users with information about the ongoing trends in a
	reporting organization&rsquo;s results from continuing operations. The amendments are effective for public business entities
	for fiscal years, and for interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December&nbsp;15, 2014. Early adoption
	is permitted. We adopted this ASU on March 1, 2015 and the effects of the pronouncement have been reflected in the
	consolidated financial statements.

	In May 2014, the FASB issued a new pronouncement
	which affects any entity using U.S. GAAP that either enters into contracts with customers to transfer goods or services or enters
	into contracts for the transfer of nonfinancial assets unless those contracts are within the scope of other standards (e.g., insurance
	contracts or lease contracts). This ASU supersedes the revenue recognition requirements in Topic 605, Revenue Recognition, and
	most industry-specific guidance. This ASU also supersedes some cost guidance included in Subtopic 605-35, Revenue Recognition&mdash;Construction-Type
	and Production-Type Contracts. In addition, the existing requirements for the recognition of a gain or loss on the transfer of
	nonfinancial assets that are not in a contract with a customer (e.g., assets within the scope of Topic 360, Property, Plant, and
	Equipment, and intangible assets within the scope of Topic 350, Intangibles&mdash;Goodwill and Other) are amended to be consistent

	not be reflected in estimating the grant-date fair value of the award. Compensation cost should be recognized in the period in
	which it becomes probable that the performance target will be achieved and should represent the compensation cost attributable
	to the period(s) for which the requisite service has already been rendered. If the performance target becomes probable of being
	achieved before the end of the requisite service period, the remaining unrecognized compensation cost should be recognized prospectively
	over the remaining requisite service period. The total amount of compensation cost recognized during and after the requisite service
	period should reflect the number of awards that are expected to vest and should be adjusted to reflect those awards that ultimately
	vest. The requisite service period ends when the employee can cease rendering service and still be eligible to vest in the award

	the analysis that a reporting entity must perform to determine whether it should consolidate certain types of legal entities. The
	amendments are an improvement to current U.S. GAAP because they simplify the Codification and reduce the number of consolidation
	models through the elimination of the indefinite deferral of Statement 167 and because they place more emphasis on risk of loss
	when determining a controlling financial interest.&nbsp; The amendments are effective for public business entities for fiscal years,
	and for interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December&nbsp;15, 2015. Early adoption is permitted, including
	adoption in an interim period. If an entity early adopts the amendments in an interim period, any adjustments should be reflected

	using a modified retrospective approach by recording a cumulative-effect adjustment to equity as of the beginning of the fiscal
	year of adoption. A reporting entity also may apply the amendments retrospectively. We plan to apply this standard beginning in

	In November 2015, the FASB issued a new
	pronouncement ASU 2015-17 which changes how deferred taxes are classified on organizations&rsquo; balance sheets. The ASU eliminates
	the current requirement for organizations to present deferred tax liabilities and assets as current and noncurrent in a classified
	balance sheet. Instead, organizations will be required to classify all deferred tax assets and liabilities as noncurrent. The amendments
	apply to all organizations that present a classified balance sheet. For public companies, the amendments are effective for financial
	statements issued for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those annual periods. Earlier
	application is permitted for all entities as of the beginning of an interim or annual reporting period. This ASU may be applied

	In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No.
	2016-02, Leases (Topic 842). The guidance supersedes existing guidance on accounting for leases with the main difference being
	that operating leases are to be recorded in the statement of financial position as right-of-use assets and lease liabilities, initially
	measured at the present value of the lease payments. For operating leases with a term of 12 months or less, a lessee is permitted
	to make an accounting policy election not to recognize lease assets and liabilities. For public business entities, the guidance
	is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early application
	of the guidance is permitted. In transition, entities are required to recognize and measure leases at the beginning of the earliest
	period presented using a modified retrospective approach. We are in the process of evaluating the impact that this guidance will
	have on our consolidated financial statements.

	In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-06,
	Contingent Put and Call Options in Debt Instruments. The amendments apply to all entities that are issuers of or investors in debt
	instruments (or hybrid financial instruments that are determined to have a debt host) with embedded call (put) options. The Amendments
	clarify the requirements for assessing whether contingent call (put) options that can accelerate the payment of principal on debt
	instruments are clearly and closely related to their debt hosts, which is one of the criteria for bifurcating an embedded derivative.
	An entity performing the assessment under the amendments is required to assess the embedded call (put) options solely in accordance
	with the four-step decision sequence. Consequently, when a call (put) option is contingently exercisable, an entity does not have
	to assess whether the event that triggers the ability to exercise a call (put) option is related to interest rates or credit risks.
	The amendments are an improvement to GAAP because they eliminate diversity in practice in assessing embedded contingent call (put)
	options in debt instruments. For public companies, the amendments are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016,
	including interim periods within those fiscal years. An entity should apply the amendments on a modified retrospective basis to
	existing debt instruments as of the beginning of the fiscal year for which the amendments are effective. We do not expect the adoption
	of this pronouncement to have a significant effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations.

	In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-07,
	Simplifying the Transition to the Equity Method of Accounting. The amendments eliminate the requirement that when an investment
	qualified for use of the equity method as a result of an increase in the level of ownership interest or degree of influence, an
	investor must adjust the investment, results of operations, and retained earnings retroactively on a step-by-step basis as if the
	equity method had been in effect during all previous periods that the investment had been held. The amendments require that the
	equity method investor add the cost of acquiring the additional interest in the investee to the current basis of the investor&rsquo;s
	previous held interest and adopt the equity method of accounting as of the date the investment becomes qualified for equity method
	accounting. Therefore, upon qualifying for the equity method of accounting, no retroactive adjustment of the investment is required.
	The amendments require that an entity that has an available-for-sale equity security that becomes qualified for the equity method
	of accounting recognize through earnings the unrealized holding gain or loss in accumulated other comprehensive income at the date
	the investment becomes qualified for use of the equity method. The amendments are effective for all entities for fiscal years,
	and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2016. The amendments should be applied prospectively
	upon their effective date to increase in the level of ownership interest or degree of influence that result in the adoption of

	a credit facility. Any issuance of equity securities could cause dilution to our shareholders. Any incurrence of indebtedness could
	increase our debt service obligations and cause us to be subject to restrictive operating and finance covenants. In addition, there

	As a holding company, our ability to pay

	subsidiaries from our Consolidated Affiliated Entities, and, to a lesser degree, our PRC subsidiaries&rsquo; retained earnings.
	In the fiscal years ended February 28/29, 2014, 2015 and 2016, TAL Beijing, Lebai Information and their designated PRC subsidiaries
	collectively charged $74.1 million, $97.6 million and $151.9 million in service fees, respectively, to our Consolidated Affiliated

	Under PRC law, each of our PRC subsidiaries
	and Consolidated Affiliated Entities in China is required to set aside at least 10% of its after-tax profits each year, if any,
	to fund a statutory surplus reserve until such reserve reaches 50% of its registered capital and to further set aside a portion
	of its after-tax profit to fund the reserve fund at the discretion of our board of directors. Although the statutory reserves can
	be used, among other ways, to increase the registered capital and eliminate future losses in excess of retained earnings of the
	respective companies, the reserve funds are not distributable as cash dividends except in the event of liquidation. In addition,
	at the end of each fiscal year, each of the private schools our company owns in China is required to allocate a certain amount
	out of its annual net income, if any, to its development fund for the construction or maintenance of the school or procurement
	or upgrade of educational equipment. For our 30 private schools which have elected to require reasonable returns, this amount shall
	be no less than 25% of the annual net income of the school, and for the remaining 17 private schools which have elected not to
	require reasonable returns, this amount shall be equivalent to no less than 25% of the annual increase in the net assets of the
	school, if any. Our PRC subsidiaries are permitted to pay dividends to us only out of their retained earnings, if any, as determined
	in accordance with PRC accounting standards and regulations.

	In June 2010, we adopted our 2010 Share
	Incentive Plan in order to attract and retain the qualified personnel, provide additional incentives to employees, directors and
	consultants and promote the success of our business. The plan permits the grant of options to purchase our Class A common shares,
	restricted shares, restricted share units, share appreciation rights, dividend equivalent rights and other instruments as deemed
	appropriate by the administrator under the plan. In August 2013, we amended and restated the 2010 Share Incentive Plan. Pursuant
	to the amended and restated 2010 Share Incentive Plan, the maximum aggregate number of Class A common shares that may be issued
	pursuant to all awards under our share incentive plan is equal to five percent (5%) of the total issued and outstanding shares
	as of the date when the amended and restated 2010 Share Incentive Plan became effective; provided that, the shares reserved shall
	be increased automatically if and whenever the unissued shares reserved accounts for less than one percent (1%) of the total then
	issued and outstanding shares, as a result of which increase the shares unissued and reserved in the Award Pool immediately after
	each such increase shall equal to five percent (5%) of the then issued and outstanding shares.

	paid a $39.0 million cash dividend with $0.25 per share to our shareholders of record at the close of business on December 7, 2012.
	We expect to source cash for future dividends, if any, from our offshore cash balance, which is more cost-efficient than using

	Our board of directors has complete discretion

	In addition, our shareholders may by ordinary resolution declare a dividend, but no dividend may exceed the amount recommended
	by our directors. Even if our board of directors decides to declare dividends, their form, frequency and amount will depend upon
	our future operations and earnings, capital requirements and surplus, general financial condition, contractual restrictions and
	other factors that the board of directors may deem relevant. Under Cayman Islands law, a Cayman Islands company may pay a dividend
	out of either profit or share premium account, provided that in no circumstances may a dividend be paid if this would result in
	the company being unable to pay its debts as they fall due in the ordinary course of business.

	Under the PRC EIT Law, an enterprise established

	and properties&rdquo; of the enterprise. A circular issued by the SAT on April 22, 2009 provides that a foreign enterprise controlled

	clarified certain matters relating to resident status determination, post-determination administration and competent tax authorities.
	It also specifies that when provided with a copy of a PRC tax resident determination certificate from a resident PRC-controlled
	offshore incorporated enterprise, the payer should not withhold 10% income tax when paying the PRC-sourced dividends, interest
	and royalties to the PRC-controlled offshore incorporated enterprise. Although both the circular and the bulletin only apply to
	offshore enterprises controlled by PRC enterprises and not those by PRC individuals, the determination criteria set forth in the
	circular and administration clarification made in the bulletin may reflect the SAT&rsquo;s general position on how the &ldquo;de

	measures should be implemented, regardless of whether they are controlled by PRC enterprises or PRC individuals.

	Based on the advice of our PRC counsel,
	Tian Yuan Law Firm, we do not believe that any of our offshore holding companies meets all of the conditions above. In addition,
	we are not aware of any offshore holding companies with a similar corporate structure as ours ever having been deemed to be PRC
	&ldquo;resident enterprises&rdquo; by the PRC tax authorities. Therefore, based on our PRC counsel&rsquo;s advice, we believe that
	none of our offshore holding companies should be treated as a &ldquo;resident enterprise&rdquo; for PRC tax purposes. However,
	as the tax resident status of an enterprise is subject to determination by the PRC tax authorities, there are uncertainties and
	risks associated with this issue. If the PRC tax authorities determine that any of our offshore holding companies are &ldquo;resident
	enterprises,&rdquo; a number of unfavorable PRC tax consequences could follow. First, we may be subject to enterprise income tax
	at a rate of 25% on our worldwide taxable income. Second, although under the EIT Law and its implementing rules, dividend income
	between qualified resident enterprises is a &ldquo;tax-exempt income,&rdquo; we cannot guarantee that dividends paid to TAL Education
	Group from our PRC subsidiaries through our Hong Kong subsidiaries would qualify as &ldquo;tax-exempt income&rdquo; and will not
	be subject to withholding tax, as the PRC foreign exchange control authorities, which enforce the withholding tax, have not yet
	issued guidance with respect to the processing of outbound remittances to entities that are treated as &ldquo;resident enterprises&rdquo;
	for PRC enterprise income tax purposes. Finally, the &ldquo;resident enterprise&rdquo; classification could result in a situation
	in which a 10% withholding tax is imposed on dividends we pay to our non-PRC enterprise shareholders and with respect to gains
	derived by our non-PRC enterprise shareholders from transferring our shares or ADSs, if such income is considered PRC-sourced income
	by the relevant PRC authorities. This could have the effect of increasing our and our shareholders&rsquo; effective income tax
	rates and may require us to deduct withholding tax from any dividends we pay to our non-PRC shareholders.

	Pursuant to the Notice on Strengthening
	Administration of Enterprise Income Tax for Share Transfers by Non-PRC Resident Enterprises, or SAT Circular 698, issued by the
	SAT on December 10, 2009, where a foreign investor transfers the equity interests of a PRC resident enterprise indirectly via disposing
	of the equity interests of an overseas holding company, or an &ldquo;Indirect Transfer,&rdquo; and such overseas holding company
	is located in a tax jurisdiction that: (i) has an effective tax rate less than 12.5% or (ii) does not tax foreign income of its
	residents, the foreign investor shall report this Indirect Transfer to the competent tax authority. The PRC tax authority will
	examine the true nature of the Indirect Transfer, and if the tax authority considers that the foreign investor has adopted an &ldquo;abusive

	the Indirect Transfer and as a result, gains derived from such Indirect Transfer may be subject to PRC withholding tax at a rate

	On February 6, 2015, the SAT issued the
	Announcement of the SAT on Several Issues Concerning the Enterprise Income Tax on Indirect Property Transfer by Non-Resident Enterprises,
	or SAT Bulletin 7, which terminated the aforementioned articles of SAT Circular 698. Pursuant to SAT Bulletin 7, where a non-resident
	enterprise indirectly transfers properties such as equity in PRC resident enterprises without any justifiable business purposes
	and aiming to avoid the payment of enterprise income tax, such indirect transfer must be reclassified as a direct transfer of equity
	in PRC resident enterprise. To assess whether an indirect transfer of PRC taxable properties has reasonable commercial purposes,
	all arrangements related to the indirect transfer must be considered comprehensively and factors set forth in SAT Bulletin 7 must
	be comprehensively analyzed in light of the actual circumstances. SAT Bulletin 7 also provides that, where a non-PRC resident enterprise
	transfers its equity interests in a resident enterprise to its related parties at a price lower than the fair market value, the
	competent tax authority has the power to make a reasonable adjustment to the taxable income of the transaction.

	There is little practical experience regarding
	the application of SAT Bulletin 7 because it was issued in February 2015. During the effective period of SAT Circular 698, some
	intermediary holding companies were actually looked through by the PRC tax authorities, and consequently the non-PRC resident investors
	were deemed to have transferred the PRC subsidiaries and PRC corporate taxes were assessed accordingly. It is possible that we
	or our non-PRC resident investors may become at risk of being taxed under SAT Bulletin 7 and may be required to expend valuable
	resources to comply with SAT Bulletin 7 or to establish that we or our non-PRC resident investors should not be taxed under SAT
	Bulletin 7, which may have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations or such non-PRC resident investors&rsquo;
	investment in us.

	purpose, cash and assets readily convertible into cash are categorized as passive assets and the company&rsquo;s goodwill and other

	with these entities, and, as a result, we consolidate their results of operations in our consolidated U.S. GAAP financial statements.

	Accordingly, assuming that we are the owner
	of our VIEs and their respective subsidiaries, as applicable, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we believe that we primarily
	operate an active after-school tutoring business in China. Based on our income and assets and the market price of our ADSs, we
	do not believe that we were a PFIC for the taxable year ended February 29, 2016 and do not anticipate becoming a PFIC for the foreseeable
	future. While we do not anticipate becoming a PFIC for the foreseeable future, no assurance can be given in this regard because
	the determination of whether we will be or become a PFIC is a fact-intensive inquiry made on an annual basis that depends, in part,
	on the composition of our income and assets. Fluctuations in the market price of our ADSs may cause us to become a PFIC for the
	current or subsequent taxable years because the value of assets for the purpose of the asset test, including the value of our goodwill
	and other unbooked intangibles, may be determined by reference to the market price of our ADSs from time to time (which may be
	volatile). In estimating the value of our goodwill and other unbooked intangibles, we have taken into account our market capitalization.
	If our market capitalization becomes less than anticipated, we may be classified as a PFIC for the current or future taxable years.

	Furthermore, the determination of whether
	we will be or become a PFIC may also be affected by how, and how quickly, we use our liquid assets. Under circumstances where our
	revenue from activities that produce passive income significantly increase relative to our revenue from activities that produce
	non-passive income, or where we determine not to deploy significant amounts of cash for active purposes, our risk of becoming classified
	as a PFIC may substantially increase. If we are classified as a PFIC for any year during which a U.S. Holder holds our ADSs or
	common shares, we generally would continue to be treated as a PFIC for all succeeding years during which such U.S. Holder holds
	our ADSs or common shares unless we cease to be a PFIC and the U.S. Holder makes a &ldquo;deemed sale&rdquo; election with respect

	As an alternative to the foregoing rules,
	a U.S. Holder of &ldquo;marketable stock&rdquo; in a PFIC may make a mark-to-market election with respect to our ADSs, but not
	our common shares, provided that the ADSs are regularly traded. Our ADSs are expected to qualify as being regularly traded, but
	no assurances may be given in this regard. If a U.S. Holder makes this election, the U.S. Holder will generally (i) include as
	ordinary income for each taxable year that we are a PFIC the excess, if any, of the fair market value of ADSs held at the end of
	the taxable year over the adjusted tax basis of such ADSs and (ii) deduct as an ordinary loss the excess, if any, of the adjusted
	tax basis of the ADSs over the fair market value of such ADSs held at the end of the taxable year, but such deduction will only
	be allowed to the extent of the net amount previously included in income as a result of the mark-to-market election. The U.S. Holder&rsquo;s

	such U.S. Holder recognizes upon the sale or other disposition of our ADSs in a year when we are a PFIC will be treated as ordinary

	semiannually in arrears on May 15 and November 15 of each year, beginning on November 15, 2014. As of February 29, 2016, we had

	exposure. We have not been exposed, nor do we anticipate being exposed, to material risks due to changes in interest rates. However,
	our future interest income may fluctuate due to changes in market interest rates. On the other hand, our future interest expense

	The value of the RMB against the U.S. dollar
	and other currencies is affected by changes in China&rsquo;s political and economic conditions and by China&rsquo;s foreign exchange

	2008 and June 2010, this appreciation halted and the exchange rate between the RMB and the U.S. dollar remained within a narrow

	the Renminbi against the U.S. dollar would have an adverse effect. Assuming we had converted the U.S. dollar-denominated cash balance
	of $84.3 million as of February 29, 2016 into RMB at the exchange rate of $1.00 for RMB6.5525 as of February 29, 2016, this cash
	balance would have been RMB552.4 million. Assuming a 1.0% appreciation of the Renminbi against the U.S. dollar, this cash balance
	would have decreased to RMB546.8 million as of February 29, 2016.

	reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external

	and nominating committee, and our independent directors would not necessarily hold regularly scheduled meetings at which only independent

	statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as

	Besides, in connection with the Company's acquisition of Firstleap during current fiscal year, Lebai Information, a wholly owned

	and in the best interests of the Company and not to use their positions for personal gains. If the Group cannot resolve any conflict

	The Company through TAL Beijing and Lebai Information,

	of the contractual agreements and in turn whether they are substantive. The Company believes there are no barriers to exercise
	its rights under the contracts and therefore they are substantive and appropriately considered in the consolidation analysis in
	accordance with ASC 810. In assessing the shareholdings of certain individual parties in the Company and in the VIEs, specifically
	Mr. Bangxin Zhang, the Company acknowledges that from November 23, 2011, Mr. Bangxin Zhang, a majority nominee shareholder in the
	VIEs, also held a majority voting interest in the Company, which resulted from conversion of Class B common shares with ten votes
	per share to Class A common shares with one vote per share by other shareholders. Therefore, the Company has reassessed the consolidation
	of its VIEs.

	Although the contractual arrangements between TAL Beijing

	respective shareholdings of Mr. Bangxin Zhang, during the period between November 23, 2011 and June 24, 2013, Mr. Bangxin Zhang&rsquo;s
	majority voting interest in the Company, when combined with his status as a majority nominee shareholder in the VIEs, could have
	constrained the ability of the Company to exercise its rights under the contractual agreements. This is due to the fact that Mr.
	Bangxin Zhang&rsquo;s majority voting interest in the Company provided him with the legal ability to control the composition of
	a majority of the board of directors and therefore may have provided him with the legal ability to affect whether or not the Company

	The preparation of financial statements in conformity
	with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue,
	costs, and expenses, and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
	Significant accounting estimates reflected in the Group's consolidated financial statements include purchase price allocation relating

	The Group does not choose to perform the assessment of
	qualitative factors for goodwill impairment and performed its annual impairment test using a two-step approach. The first step
	compares the fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying amount, including goodwill. If the fair value of the reporting unit
	is greater than its carrying amount, goodwill is not considered impaired and the second step is not required. If the fair value
	of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, the second step of the impairment test measures the amount of the impairment
	loss, if any, by comparing the implied fair value of goodwill to its carrying amount. If the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds
	its implied fair value, an impairment loss is recognized equal to that excess. The implied fair value of goodwill is calculated
	in the same manner that goodwill is calculated in a business combination, whereby the fair value of the reporting unit is allocated
	to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit, with the excess purchase price over the amounts assigned to assets and liabilities
	representing the implied fair value of goodwill.

	Investee companies over which the Group has the ability

	has an ownership interest in the voting stock of the investee between 20% and 50%, and other factors, such as representation on
	the investee&rsquo;s board of directors, voting rights and the impact of commercial arrangements, are also considered in determining

	Generally, for Xueersi Peiyou small class courses consisting

	a course, provided the course is less than two-thirds completed at the time of withdrawal. The refund is equal to and limited to
	the amount related to the undelivered classes. After two-thirds of a Xueersi Peiyou small class course is delivered, no refund
	will be provided. For Xueersi Peiyou small class courses with less than seven classes, no refund will be provided after the commencement
	of the courses. In a few cities, the Group offers refunds equal to and limited to the amount related to all the undelivered classes
	regardless of the length of the courses. For Mobby courses, the Group offers refunds of 60% of courses fees received to students
	that withdraw from a course, provided the course is less than one-third completed at the time of withdrawal. After one-third of
	the course is completed, no refund will be provided. For Firstleap, the Group offers refunds of 50% of courses fees received to
	students that withdraw from a course, provided the course is less than one-third completed at the time of withdrawal. After one-third
	of the course is completed but less than half of the courses completed at the time of withdrawal, one-third of the courses fees
	could be refunded. After half of the course is completed, no refund will be provided. For personalized premium services, a student
	can withdraw at any time and receive a refund equal to and limited to the amount related to the undelivered classes. The refund
	is recorded as a reduction of the related deferred revenue and has no impact on the recognized revenue. Historically, the Group
	has not experienced material refunds on the recognized revenue, and as such, no accrual for estimated refunds is deemed necessary.

	Tianjin, Zhejiang, and Hubei between September and December 2012. The Group's online education services and inter-company technical
	services which were previously subject to business tax are therefore subject to VAT at the rate of 6% of revenue for general VAT
	payer and hence Beijing Xintang Sichuang, TAL Beijing, Xueersi Education and Yidu Huida are deemed as general VAT payer at the

	Basic net income per share is computed by dividing net

	In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board
	(&ldquo;FASB&rdquo;) issued a new pronouncement which affects any entity using U.S. GAAP that either enters into contracts with
	customers to transfer goods or services or enters into contracts for the transfer of nonfinancial assets unless those contracts
	are within the scope of other standards (e.g., insurance contracts or lease contracts). This ASU will supersede the revenue recognition
	requirements in Topic 605, Revenue Recognition, and most industry-specific guidance. This ASU also supersedes some cost guidance
	included in Subtopic 605-35, Revenue Recognition&mdash;Construction-Type and Production-Type Contracts. In addition, the existing
	requirements for the recognition of a gain or loss on the transfer of nonfinancial assets that are not in a contract with a customer
	(e.g., assets within the scope of Topic 360, Property, Plant, and Equipment, and intangible assets within the scope of Topic 350,
	Intangibles&mdash;Goodwill and Other) are amended to be consistent with the guidance on recognition and measurement (including
	the constraint on revenue) in this ASU.

	The core principle of the guidance is that an entity should
	recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration
	to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. To achieve that core principle, an entity should
	apply the following steps:

	In June 2014, the FASB issued a new pronouncement which
	requires that a performance target that affects vesting and that could be achieved after the requisite service period be treated
	as a performance condition. A reporting entity should apply existing guidance in Topic 718, Compensation &ndash; Stock Compensation,
	as it relates to awards with performance conditions that affect vesting to account for such awards. The performance target should
	not be reflected in estimating the grant-date fair value of the award. Compensation cost should be recognized in the period in
	which it becomes probable that the performance target will be achieved and should represent the compensation cost attributable
	to the period(s) for which the requisite service has already been rendered. If the performance target becomes probable of being
	achieved before the end of the requisite service period, the remaining unrecognized compensation cost should be recognized prospectively
	over the remaining requisite service period. The total amount of compensation cost recognized during and after the requisite service
	period should reflect the number of awards that are expected to vest and should be adjusted to reflect those awards that ultimately
	vest. The requisite service period ends when the employee can cease rendering service and still be eligible to vest in the award
	if the performance target is achieved.

	retained earnings balance at that date. In addition, if retrospective transition is adopted, an entity may use hindsight in measuring

	In February&nbsp;2015, the FASB issued the ASU 2015-02,
	&ldquo;Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis&rdquo;.&nbsp; The objective of issuing the amendments is to change the analysis
	that a reporting entity must perform to determine whether it should consolidate certain types of legal entities. The amendments
	are an improvement to current U.S. GAAP because they simplify the Codification and reduce the number of consolidation models through
	the elimination of the indefinite deferral of Statement 167 and because they place more emphasis on risk of loss when determining
	a controlling financial interest.&nbsp; The amendments are effective for public business entities for fiscal years, and for interim
	periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December&nbsp;15, 2015. Early adoption is permitted, including adoption in an
	interim period. If an entity early adopts the amendments in an interim period, any adjustments should be reflected as of the beginning
	of the fiscal year that includes that interim period. A reporting entity may apply the amendments in this Update using a modified
	retrospective approach by recording a cumulative-effect adjustment to equity as of the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption.
	A reporting entity also may apply the amendments retrospectively. The Group plans to apply this standard beginning in fiscal
	year 2017 and does not expect this guidance to have a material impact on the Group&rsquo;s consolidated financial statements.

	In May 2015, the FASB issued a pronouncement which provides
	amendments on the disclosure for fair value measured investments in certain entities that calculate net asset value per share (or
	its equivalent). The amendments remove the requirement to categorize within the fair value hierarchy all investments for which
	fair value is measured using the net asset value per share practical expedient. The amendments also remove the requirement to make
	certain disclosures for all investments that are eligible to be measured at fair value using the net asset value per share practical
	expedient. Rather, those disclosures are limited to investments for which the entity has elected to measure the fair value using
	that practical expedient. The amendments apply to reporting entities that elect to measure the fair value of an investment within
	the scope of paragraphs 820-10-15-4 through 15-5 using the net asset value per share (or its equivalent) practical expedient in
	paragraph 820-10-35-59.

	years. A reporting entity should apply the amendments retrospectively to all periods presented. The retrospective approach requires

	accounting for adjustments made to provisional amounts recognized in a business combination, the amendments eliminate the requirement
	to retrospectively account for those adjustments. Under this ASU, an acquirer must recognize adjustments to provisional amounts
	that are identified during the measurement period in the reporting period in which the adjustment amounts are determined. The ASU
	also requires acquirers to present separately on the face of the income statement, or disclose in the notes, the portion of the
	amount recorded in current-period earnings by line item that would have been recorded in previous reporting periods if the adjustment
	to the provisional amounts had been recognized as of the acquisition date. For public business entities, the ASU is effective for
	fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The ASU must be applied prospectively
	to adjustments to provisional amounts that occur after the effective date. Early adoption is permitted for financial statements

	are to be recorded in the statement of financial position as right-of-use assets and lease liabilities, initially measured at the
	present value of the lease payments. For operating leases with a term of 12 months or less, a lessee is permitted to make an accounting
	policy election not to recognize lease assets and liabilities. For public business entities, the guidance is effective for fiscal
	years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early application of the guidance
	is permitted. In transition, entities are required to recognize and measure leases at the beginning of the earliest period presented

	In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No.&nbsp;2016-06,
	Contingent Put and Call Options in Debt Instruments.&nbsp; The amendments apply to all entities that are issuers of or investors
	in debt instruments (or hybrid financial instruments that are determined to have a debt host) with embedded call (put) options.
	The Amendments clarify the requirements for assessing whether contingent call (put) options that can accelerate the payment of
	principal on debt instruments are clearly and closely related to their debt hosts, which is one of the criteria for bifurcating
	an embedded derivative.&nbsp; An entity performing the assessment under the amendments is required to assess the embedded call
	(put) options solely in accordance with the four-step decision sequence. Consequently, when a call (put) option is contingently
	exercisable, an entity does not have to assess whether the event that triggers the ability to exercise a call (put) option is related
	to interest rates or credit risks.&nbsp; The amendments are an improvement to GAAP because they eliminate diversity in practice
	in assessing embedded contingent call (put) options in debt instruments. For public companies, the amendments are effective for
	fiscal years beginning after December&nbsp;15, 2016, including interim periods within those fiscal years. An entity should apply
	the amendments on a modified retrospective basis to existing debt instruments as of the beginning of the fiscal year for which
	the amendments are effective. The Group does not expect the adoption of this pronouncement will have a significant effect on its
	consolidated financial position or results of operations.

	In March&nbsp;2016, the FASB issued ASU
	No.&nbsp;2016-07, Simplifying the Transition to the Equity Method of Accounting.&nbsp; The amendments eliminate the
	requirement that when an investment qualified for use of the equity method as a result of an increase in the level of
	ownership interest or degree of influence, an investor must adjust the investment, results of operations, and retained
	earnings retroactively on a step-by-step basis as if the equity method had been in effect during all previous periods that
	the investment had been held.&nbsp; The amendments require that the equity method investor add the cost of acquiring the
	additional interest in the investee to the current basis of the investor&rsquo;s previous held interest and adopt the equity
	method of accounting as of the date the investment becomes qualified for equity method accounting. Therefore, upon
	qualifying for the equity method of accounting, no retroactive adjustment of the investment is required. The amendments
	require that an entity that has an available-for-sale equity security that becomes qualified for the equity method of
	accounting recognize through earnings the unrealized holding gain or loss in accumulated other comprehensive income at the
	date the investment becomes qualified for use of the equity method.&nbsp; The amendments are effective for all entities
	for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December&nbsp;15, 2016.&nbsp; The amendments
	should be applied prospectively upon their effective date to increase in the level of ownership interest or degree of
	influence that result in the adoption of the equity method.&nbsp; Earlier application is permitted. The Group does not expect
	the adoption of this pronouncement will have a significant effect on its consolidated financial position or results of
	operations.

	In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09, Compensation
	- Stock Compensation (Topic 718). The new guidance simplifies certain aspects related to income taxes, statement of cash flows,
	and forfeitures when accounting for share-based payment transactions. This new guidance will be effective for the Company for the
	first reporting period beginning after December 15, 2016, with earlier adoption permitted. Certain of the amendments related to
	timing of the recognition of tax benefits and tax withholding requirements should be applied using a modified retrospective transition
	method. Amendments related to the presentation of the statement of cash flows should be applied retrospectively. All other provisions
	may be applied on a prospective or modified retrospective basis. For a public entity, the amendments in this ASU are effective
	for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within that reporting period. Early application
	will be permitted. The Group is in the process of evaluating the impacts of the adoption of this ASU.

	In December 2014, the Group acquired 100% of equity interest

	contingent consideration arrangement would be automatically forfeited if the original shareholder terminates&nbsp;his&nbsp;employment

	In October 2014, the Group acquired certain equity interest in Minerva Project, Inc., a Delaware corporation that is committed
	to providing an exceptional and accessible liberal arts and sciences education for future leaders and innovators across all disciplines.
	The total consideration was $18,000,003. The Group applied cost method to account for the investment due to lack of ability to
	exercise significant influence and reviewed the investment for impairment whenever an event or circumstance indicates that an other-than-temporary
	impairment has occurred. As of February 29, 2016, no impairment loss was recorded in regard to the investment.

	In connection with the issuance of the bonds, the Company
	has entered into capped call transactions (each a &quot;Capped Call Transaction&quot;) with three initial purchasers or their affiliates
	by purchasing 8,749,913 options, which is the number of ADS initially issuable upon conversion of the Bonds in full, for $22,885,000.
	The Capped Call Transactions are expected generally to reduce the potential dilution to the Class A common shares and ADSs upon
	conversion of the Bond. The strike price of the Capped Call Transactions will initially correspond to the initial conversion price
	of the Bond and the cap price will initially be $35.39 per ADS and is subject to certain adjustments under the terms of the Capped
	Call Transactions. The Capped Call Transactions will terminate upon the maturity date of the Bond and will be settled in net ADSs
	unless the Group elected the cash settlement method. The Group accounted for the capped call transactions as equity transactions
	and recorded the $22,885,000 purchase price as a deduction of additional paid in capital.

	As of February 29, 2016, tax loss carry-forward amounted
	to $56,970,276 and would expire by the end of calendar year 2021. The Company operates its business through its subsidiaries, its
	VIEs and their subsidiaries and schools. The Group does not file combined or consolidated tax returns, therefore, losses from individual
	subsidiaries or the VIEs and their subsidiaries and schools may not be used to offset other subsidiaries' or VIEs' earnings within
	the Group. Valuation allowance is considered on each individual subsidiary and VIE basis. A valuation allowance of $8,973,880 had
	been established as of February 29, 2016, in respect of certain deferred tax assets as it is considered more likely than not that
	the relevant deferred tax assets will not be realized in the foreseeable future.

	Under U.S. GAAP, a deferred tax liability should be recorded
	for taxable temporary differences attributable to the excess of financial reporting amounts over tax basis amounts, including those
	differences attributable to a more than 50% interest in a domestic subsidiary. However, recognition is not required in situations
	where the tax law provides a means by which the reported amount of that investment can be recovered tax-free and the enterprise
	expects that it will ultimately use that means. The Company has not recorded any such deferred tax liability attributable to the
	undistributed earnings of its financial interest in VIEs because it believes such excess earnings can be distributed in a manner
	that would not be subject to income tax.

	The impact of an uncertain income tax position on the
	income tax return is recognized at the largest amount that is more-likely-than-not to be sustained upon audit by the relevant tax
	authority. An uncertain income tax position will not be recognized if it has less than a 50% likelihood of being sustained. Interest
	and penalties on income taxes will be classified as a component of the provisions for income taxes. The Group has concluded that
	there are no significant uncertain tax positions requiring recognition in financial statements for the years ended February 28,
	2014, 2015 and February 29, 2016. The Group did not incur any significant interest and penalties related to potential underpaid
	income tax expenses and also does not anticipate any significant increases or decreases in unrecognized tax benefits in the next
	12 months. The Group has no material unrecognized tax benefits which would favorably affect the effective income tax rate in future
	years.

	According to the PRC Tax Administration and Collection
	Law, the tax authority may require the taxpayer or the withholding agent to make delinquent tax payment within three years if the
	underpayment of taxes is resulted from the tax authority's act or error. No late payment surcharge will be assessed under such
	circumstances. The statute of limitation will be three years if the underpayment of taxes is due to the computational errors made
	by the taxpayer or the withholding agent. Late payment surcharge will be assessed in such case. The statute of limitation will
	be extended to five years under special circumstances which are not clearly defined (but an underpayment of tax liability exceeding
	RMB 0.1 million is specifically listed as a ''special circumstance''). The statute of limitation for transfer pricing related issue
	is ten years. There is no statute of limitation in the case of tax evasion. Therefore, the Group is subject to examination by the
	PRC tax authorities based on the above.

	New EIT Law includes a provision specifying that legal
	entities organized outside of the PRC will be considered residents for Chinese Income tax purposes if the place of effective management
	or control is within the PRC. The implementation rules to the New EIT Law provide that non-resident legal entities will be considered
	PRC residents if substantial and overall management and control over the manufacturing and business operations, personnel, accounting,
	properties, etc, occurs within the PRC. Despite the present uncertainties resulting from the limited PRC tax guidance on the issue,
	the Group does not believe that the legal entities organized outside of the PRC within the Group should be treated as residents
	for EIT law purposes. If the PRC tax authorities subsequently determine that the Company and its subsidiaries registered outside
	the PRC should be deemed a resident enterprise, the Company and its subsidiaries registered outside the PRC will be subject to
	the PRC income tax at a rate of 25% with the statute subject to the determination by PRC tax authorities.

	The Group is mainly engaged in after-school tutoring in
	the PRC. The Group's chief operating decision maker (&quot;CODM&quot;) has been identified as the Chief Executive Officer who reviews
	results of operations by geographic location (i.e. city rather than learning centers), each location constituting a subsidiary
	of the Group, when making decisions about allocating resources and assessing performance of the Group. Consequently, the Group
	has determined that each location represents an operating segment. However, under the aggregation criteria set forth in the U.S.
	GAAP with respect to segment reporting, the Group operates in only one reportable segment as all of its operating segments have
	similar economic characteristics and provide the same tutoring services.

	In August 2013, the Company amended and restated the 2010 Share Incentive Plan. Pursuant to the amended and restated 2010 Share
	Incentive Plan, the maximum aggregate number of Class A common shares that may be issued pursuant to all awards under the share
	incentive plan is equal to five percent (5%) of the total issued and outstanding shares as of the date of the amended and restated
